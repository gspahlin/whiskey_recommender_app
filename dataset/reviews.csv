0,12,"Floral with some hoppy aromas to start as well as lemon curd vanilla banana Runts ripe pears and amaretto. On the palate gentle oakiness underpins banana pudding whipped cream spiced plum amaretto ginger candy peaches and chai spices of cardamom clove and cinnamon. Well-structured and delicate—add water sparingly."
1,12,"Lots of confectionary notes on the nose: orange candy bubble gum marshmallow meringue nougat and banana pudding along with pine forest and clean mineral aromas. The chalky sweet palate brings to mind bagged marshmallows banana candy Toblerone zingy lemon peel and shelled pecans. More banana and lightly roasted nuts on the clean finish. Simple innocuous and easy to drink. Made with 100% malted barley and aged in toasted lightly charred barrels."
2,2,"Balcones has partnered with fellow Texan Spoetzl Brewery in the past supplying barrels for the Shiner bock and märzen-style beers. This is its first whiskey distilled from Spoetzl beer. Its dark hue hints at an earthy malty profile and the nose delivers rich malt spice dried fruit dried leaves and oak. Rustic on the palate with caramel and oak char. More malt on the finish with water bringing out some sweetness. (6000 bottles)"
3,8,"This malt whiskey shows some maple syrup and honey sweetness but its character comes from savory notes of earthiness and wet leaves. The easygoing palate offers some stone fruit and sweet overripe banana like a banana cream pie with graham cracker crust. But the finish circles back to savory and herbal suggesting youth. A creative if peculiar choice for Woodford crafted from 51% malted barley."
4,12,"Straight malt whiskey finished in barrels that previously held honey. The nose is enchanting perfumy with fresh flowers bubble gum cinnamon-dusted apple slices pink peppercorn sassafras and salt water taffy. The honey-barrel finish shows itself on the palate which has milk chocolate sugary chai lemon molasses pralines and of course unctuous honey. So syrupy and sweet it truly gives new meaning to “dessert whiskey.”"
5,9,"A rarity among the large American distillers: whiskey with a mashbill of 65% malted barley and 35% corn; no rye or wheat. The malted barley and corn dominate the flavor profile along with soft sweet notes of orchard fruit and golden raisin kissed with honey. The finish is soft sweet and quick. Clean with an easy-going demeanor. Not particularly complex however. If only the 35% corn was halved to include an equal amount of rye."
6,11,"Much darker in color than the Classic bottling (also reviewed this issue) as is expected. The nose warns of a wood-whelmed whiskey: dark bitter wood notes with a caramel underlay. The mouth is much hotter than the Classic bottling with bold oak spice in the front and a gooey caramel/toffee sweetness underneath…only it’s not as good as that sounds. It’s all rather one-dimensional including the hot oak finish. An interesting lesson in wood but not at $200 for the pair."
7,11,"Two malts: same distillation run same proof but this one was aged in used bourbon barrels. The color is much lighter than the new barrel bottling (also reviewed this issue) a pale straw. Nose is delicate notes of haymow planks clover honey fresh grain and sweet orange peel. Somewhat pedestrian on the palate: sweet malt dried hay more citrus and a touch of pepper with a somewhat bitter finish. No real flaws but no excitement either. Disappointing."
8,2,"A lively expressive nose greets with sweet notes of corn muffin grape jelly cinnamon sugar maple syrup cherry candy and balanced oak. The palate offers rich notes of sweet almond vanilla ice cream blackberry tart dark chocolate coconut flakes loads of baking spice and balanced rich oak. Excellent length and balance on a finish of dark chocolate tobacco leaf espresso and more spice and oak. Great sipping with water or without."
9,12,"The sweet vanilla almond and coconut aromas don’t prepare you for the chocolaty
richness of the palate but don’t stress; just enjoy the journey. It starts with Almond
Joy crème brûlée with fresh blackberries nougat and marzipan then progresses to
cacao nibs dried cranberries and cherries and a striking amaretto flavor. Everything
wraps up neatly—and lengthily—with cocoa powder black pepper mocha and
roasted walnuts. Don’t be shy about watering generously; this can quite a bit."
10,12,"Brownie batter toasted almonds maple syrup orange peel ginger raspberries and
strawberries on the nose with a touch of iced tea. The palate is oily and rich with
fruit especially after water is added; orange marmalade and cherry soda mingle with
semi-sweet chocolate and chicory coffee. Chicory mocha polished oak and cocoa
powder on the finish. Add water for more prominent fruit notes without losing the
rich character or stellar balance."
11,12,"A sweet and enticing nose of marzipan crème anglaise blueberry compote cooked
cherry brown sugar baking spice and vanilla bean. The palate showcases rich
chocolate with heaps of dark and cooked fruit: blackberry and blueberry preserves
Luxardo cherries as well as cinnamon dried ginger allspice and roasted
walnuts—everything seamlessly interwoven. Lengthy on the finish with mocha dark
chocolate polished oak and white pepper."
12,12,"Some whiskeys have already peaked at a quarter-century but this one distilled in Indiana and finished in sercial madeira casks is at its apex. Caramel-covered peanuts candied orange fresh-baked bread Toblerone cinnamon ginger snaps blueberry cobbler black tea and plenty of oak on the nose. The palate is supple and elegant with peanut brittle cherry cordial milk chocolate blueberry horehound candy cola white pepper ginger roasted pecans and refined oak. Leave plenty of time to enjoy the finish with its subtle white pepper and dark fruit undertones."
13,2,"Remarkably easy drinking considering its hyper-charged proof with an equally pronounced profile of balanced sweetness. The nose exudes caramel sauce blackberry compote cherry maple syrup semi-sweet chocolate and vanillin with earthy notes of warehouse floor and barrel char. The palate offers chocolate mousse rice pudding and cooked figs leading to a long finish of cooked plums dark berry tart and chocolate-covered marshmallows. Rich viscous and loaded with balanced sweet flavors"
14,12,"A curious character of tart fruit pervades this whiskey with an unusual finishing cask starting with underripe blackberries on the nose; there’s also citrus vanilla jasmine orange blossom almonds in the shell and a scattering of dried herbs. Tart and citric on the palate—lemon juice underripe berries Granny Smith apples red plums—yet a dark richness of coffee bean bitter chocolate and oak offer a pleasing juxtaposition. The lengthy finish retains the interplay of tart fruit and richness until the final exhale."
15,12,"The reticent nose reveals little at first but eventually a few aromas emerge: vanilla licorice tea furniture polish and a slightly tart note like gooseberry or kumquat. That’s borne out with the palate’s tart and citric character showcasing plum pear lemon gooseberry and kumquat with an herbal tinge toasted oak and a hint of almond. The finish is mouthwatering—almost mouth-puckering—and continues the tart fruit theme. This is an odd but intriguing whiskey showing great consistency and novelty."
16,12,"Distilled above 80% ABV from 99% corn and aged in used barrels this qualifies as light whiskey. Expressive nose of butterscotch brown sugar vanilla coconut cream candied pecan and maple syrup on hot pancakes. Gripped by its proof from the first sip you may find your mouth puckering from tannins and tingling with heat but the sweet flavors of dark caramel maple syrup and candied nuts offer softening balance. Generous watering is highly recommended; you won’t miss a single flavor but your tongue will recover more quickly from the high-octane ABV. (106 bottles)"
17,12,"The nose is sweet with vanilla cupcake crushed almonds pecan sandies Granny Smith apples and Chinese coconut jelly. There’s a rancio element that pervades through the palate and finish—a bit like toasted oak brown sugar and even mothballs—that gives the whiskey gravitas to counterbalance the marshmallow and lemon bar flavors. Mellow and sweet it has a lengthy finish that displays gentle finesse. (500 bottles)"
18,12,"Pastry shop aromas permeate the nose: blueberry crumble with crusted brown sugar
fresh-baked muffin boysenberry syrup and fragrant peaches nectarines and orange
peel. The palate pops with lively citrus a surprising but not unwelcome element that
plays well with toasted almond chestnut honey and nutty oak flavors. It finishes with
roasted peanuts bittersweet chocolate and tea leaf still retaining peppy citrus."
19,12,"The unusual cask finish lends a minty herbal note throughout from the nose—which
is honeyed and sweet also showcasing milk chocolate peanuts candy apple maple
syrup and a whiff of licorice—to the palate and finish. Overall this serves as a great
example of the importance of texture in whiskey; the mouthfeel is oleaginous and
almost fatty gliding over the palate and shedding flavors of chocolate-covered cherry
white pepper gingerbread and roasted walnuts. The finish is zingy with ginger white
pepper and tingling peppermint buttressed by bittersweet mocha cherry and dark
grapes."
20,2,"The mashbill consists of 51% malted oats 27% 6-row malted barley and 22% coffee malt. The nose is malty bitter and nutty offering fragrances of burnt coffee beans and mocha with undernotes of blackberry compote. A bitter yet delicious palate brings more burnt coffee beans chili pepper smoked meat toasty oatmeal and dark chocolate. A lengthy finish reprises those notes adding orange and strawberry when water is added. Dares to be different and succeeds magnificently—expressive and mouthwatering."
21,12,"A blend of two whiskeys: a high-rye bourbon and a whiskey made with 48% rye 40% corn and 12% malted barley. Dill tarragon spearmint iced tea cured tobacco leaf roasted nuts red apple black cherry and lemonade on the nose. A balanced and textured palate with iced tea dark fruit roasted pecans mild spice and rich chocolate flavors. More richness on the finish which is lengthy and lush with dark chocolate pecans and iced tea. This is well-proofed but a little water makes it sing. (3462 bottles)"
22,12,"Form a line sherry lovers: This blend of 10 year old corn and 5 and 11 year old ryes is driven by its finishing casks like many single malt scotches. Though the nose is reticent and hints at the luxe flavors the palate is a sherry bomb: brown sugar semi-sweet chocolate raisins hazelnuts nougat and figs with sprinklings of spice and subtle saline. Drying tannin and mouth-puckering saltiness on the finish with raisins and chocolate. The sherry is the point here but it integrates splendidly with the muscular whiskey. (1887 bottles)"
23,12,"Made with a mashbill of malted barley malted wheat oats and rye aged in new charred oak and finished in a port-style wine cask. The result of this complex recipe is an equally complex sensory experience with tropical and candied fruit on the nose including dried mango slices pineapple chunks raspberry and blackberry jelly candies and grape jam as well as matcha rose petals and dark chocolate. Floral flavors run almost to soapy but are tempered by cedar layered spice nuts chocolate and tobacco. A lovely finish with persistent dark fruit spices and lengthy bitter-sweetness."
24,2,"The nose offers aromas of fragrant oak baked apple caramel clove cinnamon bananas and creamy vanilla set against an herbal back note of tarragon. The palate offers cigar box slate chocolate caramel and chili pepper. Water coaxes fruit notes of blackberry lemon and cherry as well as chocolate-nut cake. A long finish has notes of tobacco warm chocolate syrup and toasted almonds. Rich layered complex and eminently pleasurable."
25,12,"The nose indicates the partial base of whiskey distilled from beer (it’s blended with straight rye) right away with citrusy pine aromas as well as brown sugar milk chocolate almond nougat and peanut brittle. The palate has a mineral quality dry with chamomile and tobacco but remains true to the lemon and pine essence that the nose outlines. There’s also dark-roast coffee chocolate black pepper and tea leaf. Medium-length on the finish with consistent lemon chocolate coffee and oak flavors. (900 bottles)"
26,2,"The nose begins with notes of earthiness and tobacco followed by banana crème brûlée cherry hard candy and cocoa powder. With water fragrant apple clementine coconut bubble gum and cotton candy notes emerge. The palate is also candied with cherry raspberry pastilles grape jelly milk chocolate and cracked pepper. On the finish it’s chocolate cream pie almond and a halo of tobacco leaf. A veritable chocolate factory balanced against a tart espresso note and tobacco."
27,12,"An eclectic blend of whiskey distilled from beer as well as rye and malt whiskeys; it proved divisive among Whisky Advocate’s blind tasters. The nose is resinous with pine needles biscuity malt macadamia nuts grapefruit oil and tropical fruit. Oily on the palate with assertive hops pineapple brown sugar nuts bread dough and reticent spice. The finish is floral hoppy and pleasantly savory with nuts grapefruit and lemon. This whiskey knows exactly what it is—unconventional—and it’s not afraid to show it. (1338 bottles)"
28,8,"Honey crackers cornbread and floral notes introduce this highly distinctive whiskey. The palate is sweet and oily in texture with a nice warming ginger note. The mouthfeel is creamy and polished as vanilla and marshmallow carry through the finish with only a gentle impression of wood. Made from 99% corn and 1% barley and aged in used casks."
29,2,"Billed as a whiskey that combines elements of bourbon and rye the nose blends pine forest lime green cardamom coriander orange cinnamon and raisins. The palate is a balance of freshly baked cinnamon buns chocolate pistachio baked apple cloves and cracked pepper. The finish is punctuated by sweet vanilla syrup and bitter orange pipe tobacco and light pepper. Smooth and pleasant it perhaps could use more aging but is well executed nonetheless."
30,13,"Same components as the No. 9 Iowa whiskey but selected from casks aged at least 4 years and bottled at a higher proof. A vibrant nose shows signs of lemon oil cake batter and sunflower seeds. There’s toasted oak wintergreen gum and vanilla on the palate with better balance achieved when water is added. The finish isn’t quite as lively as the rest of the experience with sweet oak and persistent hot spices."
31,12,"Made with corn and rye and aged in new American and French oak barrels. It’s appetizing on the nose with aromas of almond scone spread with orange marmalade along with cooked pumpkin and butterscotch pudding. More orange emerges on the sweet and candied palate as well as Big Red gum chocolate almonds and sweet grain; the oak is expressive but balanced. A clean and dry finish with almond milk chocolate and cinnamon candy."
32,13,"Made from 80% malted barley and 20% malted rye and aged in a stainless-steel cask with toasted mizunara oak staves and heads. Divisive among tasters with mint chocolate chip ice cream on the nose with saltwater taffy dried apple rings and seaweed. The palate diverts from the striking nose with dried tobacco stroopwafel and caramel M&Ms. The finish is bitter but bright with lemon and new oak. A highlight of the inventiveness among America’s craft distillers."
33,12,"A clean and inviting nose featuring fresh hay cooked corn Peanut Chews vanilla custard and black pepper. Chewy and mouth-filling texture with black cherry peanuts in Coke caramel peanut-butter molasses cookies and supple spices ending with more cherry and mature oak flavors. Straightforward uncomplicated and satisfying: a good all-rounder."
34,12,"Waxy and fragrant with citrus oil tea bag furniture polish dried flowers cooked apple and malt. At this proof the palate demands water which tames its heat to reveal candied rose petal dried ginger apple almond pistachio lemon pepper pine resin and some ashiness. It finishes waxy with charred pecans cigar end bitter oak and black pepper. There are some unusual juxtapositions here but they work. (302 bottles)"
35,13,"This whiskey blends 60% straight bourbon with 40% straight rye. The nose is zesty with citrus notes of lemon lime and a touch of grapefruit with additional fruit qualities like strawberries and cream watermelon candy and cherry juice. The palate mingles citrus and spice with orange marmalade cinnamon white pepper and fresh ginger. The finish is nutty and warm with persistent peppery spice and toasted oak. Its nuance shines brighter without water."
36,13,"Made with unmalted and malted barley triple distilled and matured in virgin white oak before a finish in Pedro Ximénez and amontillado sherry casks. There is a musty funkiness on the nose but underneath lurk aromas of banana Runts herbal cough syrup and fruit cocktail. The light and nimble palate buzzes with fizzy lemon sweet nuts cinnamon and allspice. Frozen chocolate-covered banana on the finish. It shares DNA with some American single malts."
37,12,"Distilled from corn oats wheat and barley at Copper Fox Distillery and blended by Founding Spirits. The nose has clean sweet applewood smoke raw peanuts oolong tea grain and treacle. On the palate there’s strong oak but it’s well-tempered by spice smoke savory nuts grilled apples and chalky saline minerality. The finish is savory and nutty—appetite-inducing—and overall it takes water well."
38,8,"A host of sweet confections awaits in this whiskey which appears to be Kentucky bourbon with some types of added flavoring. Big caramel gives way to angel food cake crème brûlée lemon chiffon and batter. But it doesn’t stray far enough to resemble a flavored whiskey delivering an oily texture and nice viscosity oozing with apple citrus grape soda and hints of leather. Not one for the purist but enjoyable all the same."
39,2,"An American whiskey from Indianapolis-based Hotel Tango. The nose has notes of slate herbs tea lemon peel bitter orange and vanilla wafer. The palate is somewhat green with raisin cinnamon candy vanillin grenadine bitter chocolate pecan and cracked pepper. The finish is long and flavorful offering orange cherry vanilla ice cream mocha and licorice. Perhaps too much wood influence but water balances it well creating a smooth complex and enjoyable whiskey."
40,13,"A blend of house-made single malt and sourced pot-distilled light whiskey. Sweet campfire smoke wends its way through grain nut and toast aromas with hints of peppermint vanilla and milk chocolate. Smoke and sweetness interplay on the palate with vanilla nougat and smoked almonds. The abrupt finish comes off a bit hot but is mouthwatering all the same. It’s enchanting and a creative expression of smoke at times evoking a smoky Toblerone bar."
41,13,"A blend of bourbon and rye matured on a barge in the Mississippi River. A light fruitiness on the nose turns candied at times with raspberry-peach iced tea strawberry hard candies and grape soda. That quality carries over to the palate where cherry cough syrup and orange peel meet lemon and dry oak. The finish is quick with more fruitiness in the form of cherry skins. It’s light-bodied for the proof but with full flavor. (10300 bottles)"
42,2,"This limited release is aged in new charred oak like Michter’s bourbons and ryes but finished in uncharred barrels with a milder toast profile. Made from a mashbill that doesn’t qualify it as bourbon or rye it has a nose of perfumed oak candle wax iced tea orange blossom and wild strawberries. A silky palate of licorice spice raisins and dark fruits is followed by a finish of apple pear honey chocolate and oak."
43,2,"Made by Oregon’s Ransom Wine Co. & Distillery Emerald is an American interpretation of a traditional Irish pot still whiskey. The nose offers charred oak bitter orange toasted grain oatmeal dried leaves and cherry bitters. A spicy palate features notes of orange marmalade milk chocolate and red apples. Water unlocks flavors of candied melon fresh oranges and raspberries. The finish has charred oak chocolate fudge coffee and roasted malt."
44,12,"The nose is plucky and herbaceous with tarragon dill licorice and heaps of chili powder and cornmeal—a bit like elote from a street vendor. Savory flavors dominate the palate which is dry and nutty; water brings out meaty chili unsweetened chocolate and coffee bean. The finish has grilled corn more chili spices and roasted pecans. Water softens the edges but use a light touch so as not to over dilute."
45,12,"Delicately expressive on the nose with lemon icebox cookies pistachio ice cream almonds lemon-lime soda toasted oak and a hint of dried chili. There’s zingy citrus zipping through the oak-led palate which also has sweet vanilla hints of nuts spice and some savory dried chili. It finishes short with sweet oak. A blend of whiskeys made with wheat and malted barley and oats and malted barley. (Utah only)"
46,12,"The mashbill for this single pot still-style whiskey from Dry Fly Distilling contains oats along with wheat and malted and unmalted barley. The delicate nose has pistachio pudding carob chips dried flowers iced tea white pepper allspice and almond nougat. It’s led by oak on the palate but add a few drops of water and cherries berries candied violets almonds pistachios semi-sweet chocolate and gentle spices reveal themselves. Saving the best for last it finishes with cooked dark fruits varnish and leathery oak. (250 bottles)"
65,9,"I love Rogue beers as well as Rogue’s attitude and philosophy. But this whiskey just tastes too immature—harsh sweet and one-dimensional. Maybe with some additional aging it might come around mellow out and develop but it has a long way to go."
47,2,"This first release in a series combines 15 year old light whiskey and 8 year old Tennessee whiskey. Vanilla cake honeyed almonds and butterscotch on the nose balance against notes of antique shop dried leaves and undertones of herbs and barrel char. A creamy palate brings flavors of spiced chocolate baked cherries honeyed almonds and oak. Crème brûlée on the finish with baked croissant buttered almonds spiced oak tannins and candied orange."
48,11,"Off-market for two years. Nose of caramel sugar wafers and a touch of just-ripe nectarine. Sweet/smooth in the mouth with sweet mint rock candy and gliding King syrup flavors slipping all over the tongue while oak notes provide high spiciness. Finishes with a lingering light sweetness like a dissolving sugar flake. With all the sweetness though it doesn’t cloy. Nice if not complex."
49,5,"Two things show almost immediately: alcohol level and sherry cask. Heat and salty nuttiness really express themselves early on eventually followed by flavors of caramel chew graham cracker nutmeg and cinnamon with an unwanted bitterness. Walnut shell and smoked meat come along too for a medium finish that tingles. With a drop of water its bitterness turns to oak making it the preferred way to sip its hefty proof. Sourced whiskey."
50,12,"Piney and herbaceous on the nose with Popsicle stick lemongrass fresh oregano Lemon Pledge and a hint of vanilla. Light-bodied and silky in texture it has plenty of vanilla and toasted wood sweetness along with hints of herbs. The finish is short and a bit hot with simple oak flavors."
51,8,"Oak-forward with gentle sweetness and light in body this is a simple and enjoyable enough with straightforward vanilla and toasted nuts. The finish is a touch astringent as the drying oak tannins slightly overwhelm the modest fruit."
52,5,"Light straw color but its rich aroma contradicts its youthful color. Marshmallow and cotton candy really come out strong quickly followed by decadent bakery aromas. Fresh-baked muffins heavy whipping cream and vanilla icing with hints of caramelized barley and nutmeg. Its weaknesses are a slightly adhesive mouthfeel and short finish but the pronounced flavors still make it a borderline sipper or a just-add-water whiskey. Sourced whiskey."
53,2,"Distilled from a mashbill of oats malted barley rye and wheat then aged in heavily charred new oak barrels from Minnesota. The grains are sourced from a Midwestern organic farmer collective. The nose is herbaceous offering sarsaparilla vanilla licorice and menthol. A somewhat jagged palate has notes of pine ginger root vanilla sweet oak heat and pepper. The finish reprises the flavors of the palate—notably menthol pine oak ginger and vanilla."
54,12,"Sweet and simple from the start to finish this whiskey shows best on the nose with state-fair aromas of caramel corn cotton candy and bubble gum as well as vanilla meringue and coconut cream pie. There’s a slightly harsh note on the palate but it’s softened by vanilla yellow cake with white frosting and coconut. Very quick to finish."
55,13,"Made from unmalted barley malted barley and oats and aged in used bourbon and rye barrels. The nose is promising and evocative of a florist’s shop with notes of flower stems lime peel peach jam and orange blossom. The palate which can be rough and thin at times is less encouraging with faint floral notes grainy sawdust mustiness overripe fruit and hints of mushy citrus. The finish is short with dull oak. An Irish homage that needs further development."
56,12,"Generously woody with pencil shavings and lumber mingled with chamomile white flowers and vanilla on the nose. The light-bodied palate is sweet and floral with cloying milk chocolate toasted coconut and vanilla flavors. It’s just a bit simple and boring.

This or whiskey has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: minimum 6 months;
Processing: Distilled in Indiana and aged in new charred oak barrels then put through a “compression aged” process using new charred oak pieces."
57,12,"Youthful and light with aromas of vanilla-scented candle coconut pastry cream almond shell and prominent alcohol. The palate is nearly neutral showing reticent flavors of vanilla butterscotch pudding and lemon cake with the alcohol again quite evident. The finish is barely there: a bit of toasted oak and wood sugar."
58,2,"Hints of lime new oak and new leather on the nose as well as licorice candy. Well-textured—soft and fairly smooth—on the palate but with only faint notes of toffee praline pineapple and orange slices all struggling to emerge. There is also an overarching youthful overtone of new wood. In general the whiskey seems thin and lacking any great depth or vibrant flavors."
59,12,"Sweet kettle corn and caramel-covered nuts on the nose along with a smoky and woody aroma—dry toasted wood on a fire. The palate is led by sugary grain and wood char with caramel corn and grilled corn on the cob along with a hint of wood spice. It’s cloying and sweet on the finish yet retains strong oakiness. Distilled from a bourbon mash and “finished” with toasted wood chips using a proprietary technology."
60,9,"Layers of sweetness: concentrated vanilla marshmallow taffy white chocolate and caramel. Subtle underlying fruit. Palate: Again the layers of sweetness but not to the point of being cloying or unpleasant-underlying notes of oak and minty resinous spices emerge mid-palate and cut through the sweetness to keep it from dominating too much. Sweet and spicy finish."
61,12,"Sweet candied aromas pervade the nose: caramel corn watermelon Jolly Rancher orange Popsicle and strawberry Blow-Pop. There’s also shaved wood and construction paper. The silky palate holds dilute flavors of bubble gum candy vanilla and toasted wood and rapidly turns bitter on the finish"
62,11,"An odd touch of the roasted-grain smell of the dryhouse here then youthful whiskey underneath it: sweet mint barrel. Flavors tumble across the tongue: cocoa mint coconut grass and a bit of spice. This is six months in the barrel and it's good for that; I also like that it's all Montana-grown grain. But you have to wonder what it will be like after another four years."
63,5,"There’s promise here with peach dried apricot baking spice and vanilla delighting the olfactory and a slight hint of coffee just in case you needed it. But the intense heat shows itself and grain covers subtle sweetness and spice. The best high-proof whiskeys are actually quite smooth; this needs water to find its sweet spot. Sourced whiskey."
64,9,"A special limited edition release of Early Times whisky. Described as “Old Style Sour Mash” on the label. Simple straight-forward notes of soft vanilla sweet corn light caramel golden raisin and (with some coaxing) subtle anise. Youthful on the palate with a rather harsh oak finish. I’m happy for the celebration but a bit disappointed with the whisky. Two bottles of this (the volume equivalent of one standard 750 ml bottle) will set you back about $24 and there are many superior whiskies at this price point. Price is per 375ml bottle."
66,12,"Without water this oddball is deeply herbaceous and spiced with aniseed coriander hardwood smoke brown sugar and powerful oak throughout the nose and palate. Add some water and suddenly the sunbeam breaks through the crack in the curtain. There are still plenty of herbal and spice notes but now more dimension emerges—orange forest fruits semi-sweet chocolate coffee ice cream and sweet woodsmoke fully relaxed in its integration. The finish is savory then sweet—clean and rich a revelation. (150 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
67,10,"Burning driftwood crisp bacon fat and melting asphalt in a heat wave cut through with vanilla cream butterscotch and chocolate ganache. Great Southern distillery has unleashed a multidimensional beast that opens innocently with vanilla and honey quickly blown away by a blast of salt and pepper before a deep primeval base of peat and spice well up from the depths of your soul. Amazingly great tenderness even at this strength with a long complex finish of smoke sweetness and spice. A$700"
68,12,"A curious single malt smoked with native Australian peat and mallee wood stumps and matured in port casks. The smoke expresses itself little on the nose which shows aromas of nougat apples pears blueberries blackcurrants raisins and a mineral freshness. But the palate allows plenty of room for the smoke which has a gentle herbaceous pungency of tarragon tobacco leaf and eucalyptus; there’s also licorice dark chocolate coffee bean and rich oak. The finish is equally rich with lingering herbal smoke. (120 bottles for the U.S.)"
69,10,"Aromatic spices scents of bleached driftwood and hints of bramble and blackcurrant on this blend of wheat and malt whiskies matured in Australian red wine barrels. The palate shifts quickly from white to milk chocolate red apple crème de cassis peppercorn spices and cookies but it’s soft and gentle finely structured with more dark fruits coming to the fore. The finish is drying and short with evaporating spice."
70,10,"Fresh clean aromas of key limes the waxy leaves of tropical greenhouse foliage and creamed coconut encased in chocolate. Plenty of acidity and exotic spices at play. There’s a bouquet of citrus and botanical notes to sip. Smooth with a big slug of warmth: white peach nectarine melon ground almond sliced lemon with spicy undertones. The finish is complex with plum skin cooked gooseberry tangerine oils and tingle of sherbet. A little beauty though the outturn seems woefully meager. (50 bottles) £150"
71,10,"Aromas of black grape sultana fresh plum and fennel seed arouse the senses. The Australian port-cask finish coats the bourbon characteristics enriching rather than saturating draping raspberry and cherry around caramels and runny honey. Sultana notes pull ahead the whole experience becoming buttery in the final stretch as the spices balance out. More spice to the fore on the finish pumping in the pepper while serving up rich cooked fruit. A highly respectable effort. A$135"
72,4,"This is the distillery's flagship brand and it's up there with anything New World whisky has to offer. The nose is subtle with plum and peach; on the palate there are chewy orange and other citrus notes honey coconut and caramel. The finish is sweet and rounded. A delicate and sophisticated whisky that reflects the rise and rise of this distillery. A$88"
73,4,"Lark is on Australia’s frontline but this is a hard sell. This is big bucks for untried whisky. No doubt though this is history in the making. There’s a big cinnamon and nutmeg kick to this and with water a rootsy sweet apple core and a menthol hit wrap themselves around flavors of crab apples and dates. It’s different easy to like and exciting. Australian whisky is on a roll. AUD220 (Not available in the U.S.)"
74,4,"Last year’s cask strength version was 55% and way too young. There is also a view that the early stages of maturation in port are not only inconsistent but can be negatively wayward. No such problems here. This is no longer an ugly duckling but a young swan: rich fruitcake fresh summer fruits and a charcoal undercarpet that helps quash the overly sweet notes. This then is the world's most improved whisky. A$170"
75,4,"Southern Coast Distillers is part of a new wave of distillers in Victoria South Australia and unlike many fledgling distilleries who bottle too early and learn their trade in public view with blemished linseed-sappy malt this distillery has hit the ground running and is already making fabulous whisky. There isn't an off note here and it combines lemon sherbet bonbons honeyed vanilla bitter dark chocolate licorice and some pepper. Delightful. A$110"
76,10,"First of two bottlings. The Old Hobart distillery used 100-liter sherry French oak quarter casks to create this beauty. Hediard fruit jellies (blackcurrant quince and mango) nutmeg cassia hot sand and caramelized biscuits. The sherry gives a willowy soft opener with tobacco bitter plums and Earl Grey tea bleeding out to dark toffees espresso and a Flemish biscuit note. Water produces a cappuccino finish. For the alcohol content the pair are similarly priced but this one offers greater rewards. £189"
77,10,"Braided apple puff pastry sultana custard a hint of blueberry and jam slathered over warm scones backed by hot chocolate and Christmas spices. The taste experience is surprising as just when it draws you in with green apples and banana custard it goes off on a tangent with mouth-drawing sour green plums peppercorn and candied wild strawberries and concludes with a ground ginger and peppery finish."
78,10,"This is more reassuringly tawny than the standard strength and the alcohol strength oozes out of the glass. The nose is cleaner and fresher than the standard with maraschino cherry freeze-dried raspberries white chocolate and tamarind pulp. Neat sips showcase rich dark fruits of blackcurrant black cherry and dense chew bars. A dash of water amplifies the sweet fruits with heavenly dusty aromatics and red fleshy fruits. Yours for a pretty penny. £189"
79,10,"It’s not bourbon but the mashbill contains corn rye and malted barley sourced from western Australia. It has zippy vanilla whole hazelnut hints of rye spiciness overlaid with taffy candy and fresh fruit. Syrupy sweetness drenches the taste buds peeling back honeyed layers to reveal vanilla melon ripe banana citrus and tropical green fruits diluting to delicious coconut creaminess. A moreish small batch whiskey with a finish of custard cream biscuits that sticks it to those boys in Tennessee. A$130"
80,4,"If you've tasted any Connemara Irish peated whiskey you'll know and love this. This whisky is the most improved in the Bakery Hill range so that now with water the peat weaves patterns round the standard green apple honey and vanilla heart of the malt. Australian peat is very different to that of Scotland and here it is wispy smoky and sweet. A$115"
81,4,"Nobody hollers louder than an Aussie when he wants to. This malt is matured in 100-liter American oak casks and finished in port barrels just as Cask M76 is (also reviewed this issue) but if M76 is about pub rock this is Wolfmother a hard-hitting rich forceful but complex wave of loveliness with fig and date to the fore baked peach and crystallized brown sugar. It's creamy rich mouth coating and there's some menthol cough drop in there for good measure. A$130"
82,10,"A bright golden whisky with a nose like a basket of fruits: green apple honeydew clementine and pastries. Made from Tasmanian barley and matured in bourbon and French oak barrels the fruity palate follows the journey begun with the nose though with greater emphasis on citrus than apple. Layer upon layer of peppery spice overlay some sour fruits ending on a finish of grapefruit sourness. (950 bottles)"
83,4,"You don’t want to argue with this sport or it’ll deck you. Look at the strength for a starter. But this is Australian whisky going off into a whole new direction and not taking prisoners on the way. It’s
Lark whisky mixed with another Tasmanian one so you get the big clove and nutmeg apple core and fermenting fruit notes but with honey and peat in the mix. Love it loathe it but you can’t ignore it. A$190"
84,4,"While much of the interest in Australian whisky has focused on Tasmania there are mainland distilleries such as The Great Southern Distilling Company and this one which have been making a major contribution to the country’s growing whisky reputation. In fact David Baker’s malt is as good as anything in Australasia. This is a Scotch-style single malt all clean fresh green fruit particularly apples and some orange. The taste is zingy with almonds and sweet chocolate-covered digestive biscuits. Delicious. AUD105 (Not available in the U.S.)"
85,10,"This second standard-strength version of Casey Overeem’s sherry pair bears toffee apple cherry loaf prune juice and aged Aceto Balsamico Di Modena on the nose adding a rewarding depth of flavor. It’s rich full-bodied and clings to the teeth like a mollusk to a rock during a storm over the South East Cape. A late-night dram of cherry flesh Brazil nut ground cinnamon whole clove and cacao that dissipates into a relaxing finish of well-worn leather and wax cherry lips. £140"
86,10,"Vanilla pod dark toffee fudge manuka honey and chocolate-dipped banana bites greet the senses quickly followed by a palate of tiffin raspberry jam damsons poached pear slightly bitter cacao and Nutella scraped across hot toast. Smooth medium weight. Malty notes emerge yet sweetness battles to the fore. This is the taste of modern young Australian whisky: Australian barley Australian barrels and matured in the Australian climate at Melbourne’s New World Whisky distillery. Unsurpassed drinkability: it just wants to please. A$83"
87,10,"Creamy lemon truffles cereal notes vanilla sponge dry oak with peppered steak seasoning. Creamy sweet buttery soft honeydew melon peach notes and orange zest with a soft late spiciness though the impression is much more tame than the nose suggests. Buttery mouth-coating finish with gentle spices on the core whisky from this Tasmanian distillery."
88,4,"Sullivans Cove whisky is matured in French oak and bottled as single cask offerings and there is a big variation in taste. As a rule of thumb though anything with a number higher than 330 is worth checking out. This is a standout moving away from the Speyside-style fruitiness of some casks toward treacle chicory coffee and burnt hazelnut on the nose. The taste has apricot sweet orange honey cinnamon and menthol and the finish is soft and light. A$95"
89,4,"I'm not sure that if you loved Cask 4 you'd be so pleased with Cask 5 because it's completely different. This has the shadow of Bill Lark all over it with big over-cooked red apple flavors combining with walnut oil orange liqueur treacle toffee stewed berries and some oaky astringency. It's rich full complex and a grower — and I can feel a new love affair starting right here. A$110"
90,1,"Patrick Maguire who now heads up Hobart’s Sullivan’s Cove distillery started work with Bill Lark before taking over Sullivan’s Cove in 2003. A French-design brandy still produces a very floral sweet and full-flavored spirit with notes of lime blossom and wood sap. It’s a bold distillate but there’s sufficient sweetness and fragrant spice to balance. €95"
91,4,"This is a creamy rich refreshing departure from the more common styles of Australian whisky and it's ample proof that diversity will be a major part of the Oz story. This is milky chocolate and cocoa almost like cachaça with some soft violet and red wine notes and—somewhat bizarrely—black currant sorbet. As I said about shouting Aussies above this is anything but; a delicate light-fingered exercise in style. A$125"
92,10,"Brace yourself: the marauding alcohol vapors will slap you across the chops within inches of the glass. The finishing vessel a small sherry cask exudes sweet red fruits; Fragola Fabbri candied strawberries stewed apples and brandy characteristics. Diving in neat become immersed in a sweeping intensity of fruity plum crabapple and fig. Taming with water unlocks flavors of honey caramel green fruits and vanilla though it retains that plum leitmotif throughout. Finish of black pepper on stewed fruits. A$220"
93,4,"Bakery Hill has been at the forefront of Australian whisky for some years now but David Baker's struggled to keep making good whisky and simultaneously open export channels for it. That's about to change and a good thing too because this is very good indeed — clean fresh and malty with plenty of honey and vanilla — smooth blemish-free and excellently made  this wouldn't look out of place in Speyside. A$88"
94,4,"Arguably the world’s most improved whisky Limeburners is unrecognizable from the fledgling releases of a few years back. This is matured in 100-liter American oak barrels and finished in port. It is big and rich in flavor with oily fruit and floral notes a trace of young green barley and menthol licorice and spicy cardamom. Australian whisky is a tidal wave starting to swell. It has some way to travel but when it strikes it'll be huge. A$130"
95,4,"There are now more distilleries on the Australian island of Tasmania than there are in Ireland Japan or Canada and the island is demanding to be taken seriously as a whisky territory. At the forefront of the Aussie invasion is Sullivan’s Cove once home to some decidedly ordinary whiskies but now kicking into gear. This needs water but is a unique mix of fruit nuts and soft malt. Clean more-ish and unique this is Australia raising its flag."
96,4,"One of the challenges we face with new whisky is that it is evolving quickly and while we understand that it's hard to keep up. But the upside is we have shorter memories and that means life's easier for the likes of Old Hobart. A year ago this malt was two-dimensional overly sweet and definitely a work in progress. The change is remarkable. Now it's balanced the sherry and sweetness are in order and the sappiness has retreated. A$130"
97,10,"This verdant Tasmanian whisky is the combined product of American oak and French oak port cask aging. You get waxy palm fronds hazelnut shells toasted spices and celery tops laid over a groveside box wedged full of freshly-picked Florida oranges.Soft honeyed and gently spicy on the palate before the herbal and botanical notes overgrow it leaving clove pepper and aniseed balls on the finish. Water cuts through the greenery to show lemon meringue pie with a grapefruit edge."
98,1,"Although the Aussie whisky-making industry started in Tasmania the distilling bug is spreading across the country. Small-scale the distilleries may be but the use of brewer’s yeast local peat (in Tasmania’s case) and wood sourced from the wine industry has immediately given Aussie whisky an identity of its own. Yes it’s tiny but every great new whisky no matter where it is from chips away at Scotch whisky’s hegemony. Tasmanian-based Bill Lark is the founding father of the modern Australian whisky industry. He uses local peat and ages in small casks — and only does single cask releases. This means that by the time a tasting note is written the whisky has gone but here’s what I thought of one of them. There’s a glimpse of some fresh malt but it is the heightened aromatics that are the most interesting here. Lark points to the yeast mix as the origin of this scent. His small stills however give a muscularity to the palate while the oak is in balance. €99"
99,10,"The Nant estate is self-sufficient for about a third of the barley it needs to make its Tasmanian Highland malt whisky. Nosing reveals a lemon tree light summer fruits of melon lychee and grape floral honey barley sliced almond fragrant vanilla and a powdering of spices. Well-structured and full bodied there is blossom honey baked lemon Murray mints fresh water mint green fruits and sweet vanilla. It slips down beautifully coating the mouth leaving light spice and dark sugar. A$165"
100,4,"Lark Distillery celebrates its 20th year in 2012 and it's starting to settle on a house style: big apple fruity whiskey with menthol candy cough drop and hickory notes and some red berry fruits from maturation in quarter casks made from port barrels. This special bottling uses casks made of wood that held 100 year old Para Port among the world's finest. All the Lark traits are there with a liqueur-like bonus. Intriguing. $AUS 132"
101,4,"Expecting Scotch single malt? Go to the door and kick that thought right down the garden. Open your mind. Consider Australia as you do bourbon or Irish whiskey. It’s whisky but not as the Scots know it — a new branch to the whisky tree. This is different but special. Fresh clean young green apple and pear and not much else. But there’s a distinctive herbal rootsiness here that’s all Australian. There’s a clean sweet purity to the malt too. Impressive. AUD150 (Not available in the U.S.)"
102,4,"If Tasmania is defining a distinctive whisky style this is it. If you buy into the big red fruit and berry full-frontal Aussie assault accompanied by a rural earthiness then this may be too ordered for you. But for most whisky drinkers exploring new territories the rounded red berry and orange fruits and the full rich sweet center make it a perfect entry-level whisky to ease you in. A$130"
103,4,"What a difference a cask makes say Southern Distillers and they're not kidding. Just five casks have been made available so far each one hand-crafted in traditional fashion by people who know what they're doing and each one pushing out the envelope. This is the nuttiest and dustiest of the five and it wears its youth on its sleeve but there are no feints and the whisky marks a step up in quality with date walnut and golden syrup in the mix. A$110"
104,10,"A soft wadding of port gently prods the senses producing a nose like a tincture from the hedgerows: redcurrant raspberry hawthorn elderberry and fresh grassy notes with an accompaniment of waxed thornproof jackets star anise cardamom and muted cloves. After maturation in 100-liter French oak quarter casks the mouthfeel is thinner than expected. It’s like sinking your teeth into a slice of watermelon. There’s raspberry Kola Kubes and a touch of bitterness before a sticky finish. £140"
105,1,"Tasmania may be setting itself up as the Speyside of Australia but there are a growing number of distilleries on the mainland such as Bakery Hill in Bayswater on the Dadenong foothills of Victoria which was started by David Baker in 1999. Working with tall stills his aim is to make a lightly fragrant spirit and certainly that intense banana-like quality is there on nose and palate while the use of sherry casks adds a fruitcake and golden raisin depth."
106,4,"Down in Tasmania they're about to start distilling a corn mash whiskey and a triple distilled Irish-style one and here farmer and sand and ice sculptor Peter Bignell is using his own rye to distill spirit on a still he built himself. This is new white spirit made with 100 percent rye and bottled at 40%. It's more pastis than whiskey a soft licorice and aniseed alcopop which is way too drinkable. A rising star. $AUS 99/500ml"
107,4,"The latest addition to Tasmania’s burgeoning and diverse whisky industry bottles for the first time in October 2011. This is just 4 years old and while this isn’t Kavalan the flavor is amazing: full and rich sherry honeyed intense and fruity. The score reflects the fact that it’s well-made yet way short of its optimum age. But wow — what a prospect this distillery is! AUD150 (Not available in the U.S.)"
108,4,"Given that this is described as a blend and it's from the New Zealand Whisky Co. you'd be well within your rights to stay clear. But it's not it’s a blend of two single malts from two different countries New Zealand and Australia; what will soon be known as Hybrid. It's not the best from either country dumbing down the big flavors and leaving the fruit and spice falling a little flat. Arguably another good entry level whisky though.  NZ$95"
109,4,"Nant is everything an idyllic island distillery should be sited in the wilds of Tasmania with a smart visitor center and a bar that overlooks the rolling rugged countryside. The whiskey though is surprisingly gentle and soft. There is an overly simplistic sweet sherry version but this gutsier berry-soaked sweet and rounded version is the one to watch. It's a work in progress but the cleanliness and flavor development hint at great things. Watch this space.  $AUS 190/500 ml"
110,4,"This is matured in 100 liter casks and the port is all over the youthful spirit. But while the combination leaves a lot to be desired and there are all sorts of youthful errors on show the fruity rich and creamy core of this malt suggests that we’re looking at the stirring of a giant. Bottled this fall at 4 years this is a holding tank. What follows will be immense. AUD180 (Not available in the U.S.)"
111,4,"Hellyers Road is Tasmania's biggest distillery formed by dairy producers who feared the island's dairy business was under threat from mainland producers and needed a fallback policy. Early bottlings were dreadful but this is a big step forward. It's still an acquired taste though with rootsy vegetal and grassy Scottish Lowland elements. It's saved by a cocoa powder mint chocolate and puff pastry heart.  $AUS 120"
112,10,"My my hey hey. Freshly-laid asphalt and a swarm of peat buzzes up the nose. Heavy oilskins stout wellingtons and bladderwrack entangled in lobster pots. There is charming sweetness; a pussycat compared to the tiger of a nose. A thick teeth-coating warming glow emanates from deep at the back of the palate with some roasted orange and dark chocolate. Superb balance between the peat and the sweetness. A triumph. It’s better to burn out than to fade away. €48"
113,10,"Jasmin Haider-Stadler is the second-generation distiller at Austria’s most-visited distillery. The distillery is particularly noted for its rye whiskies and this is their best seller made from 60% rye and 40% malted barley. The nose has nutmeg and cinnamon spices milk chocolate and dark fruits. An ever-changing spectrum of flavors delights the palate: vanilla crisp cinnamon dusty cocoa hot chocolate pepper and bramble jelly. Any keen importers reading this? €47"
114,10,"Distilled by Hans Reisetbauer this is like an amplified version of his 12 year old (see below). Red pears pomegranate walnut husks and more active spices from mace and asafetida to coriander. The flavors unfurl sedately over the palate like a flower coming into bloom: soft honeyed fruit pear raspberry strawberry spices bramble and chocolate drops. A drying finish of five-spice dried apple and chocolate. Best of this Austrian trio."
115,10,"The youngest offering has an attractive fruity nose with red apple menthol and wax candles all nicely backed with spicy oak. Honey-dipped apple slices citrus chocolate-covered raisins and very gentle spice make this a most agreeable sipping whisky. The finish has coffee grounds with a pinch of spice. Perfectly delicious it’s just a little meek and light bodied with a shorter flavor trajectory."
116,10,"Peppermint cream menthol whole plum cranberry and very delicate toasted-wood spices. The palate has cooked apple Fruit Pastilles plum flesh malt drinking chocolate and brown sugar. As time progresses it develops a slight sourness with the spices spreading out wide under the tongue. The final phase conjures up a char note black tea and burnt sultana bread leading to a finish of spices and dulled stewed fruit."
117,10,"Austria now boasts more than a dozen distilleries. Combining maturation in fresh bourbon sherry and Madeira casks can help younger whiskies like this to combine different flavors. The Madeira and sweet sherry dominate the nose initially but there are dried cherry fresh fig marzipan and shelled pistachio too. It’s a smooth light to medium-weight dram with good maltiness ground almond latte dry sherry milk chocolate apple and baked pears. The long finish leaves raisins and a coffee-bean intensity. €48"
118,10,"A rich sumptuous nose of deep oxidized sweetness derived from storage in 128-liter madeira barrels this cask strength Broger has wafts of fallen orchard fruit gooseberry fool young rhubarb stems and lime curd. It’s thick chewy and syrupy wallowing in flavors of toffee apple deep vanilla and stewed fruits though with a dash of water some brown bananas and coffee cream notes peek through. A fabulous nose but the palate is pulled toward an overripe fruity profile. (164 bottles) €84"
119,10,"The key smoke characteristic here comes from kilning the barley over beechwood. The resultant aromas conjure up sweet mash charcoal sticks slabs of fish from the smoker and dilapidated casks warming in the sunshine by the shoreline. It’s been matured for over 3 years in French Limousin oak and the taste runs sweet with peach nectarine and melon through Seville orange to mixed peel and taffy candy. A finish of dried fruits with lingering smoke in the tail. €48"
120,10,"A few years ago Broger branched out from eau de vie into whisky making in their Carl artisan still. This one is made from 100% Voralberg Riebel maize matured for four years before finishing in Sauternes casks from Château d’Yquem. There are pronounced sweet aromas with kernels of cooked corn and potato scones. Fruity clean-cut and refreshing lemon sherbet and light butterscotch but the sweetness is kept in check even with a cream and sugar finish. A handsome introduction. €48"
121,10,"A quadruple-distilled whisky in a glass-stoppered bottle the sherry influence has left its mark on the nose with ripe Victoria plums glacé cherry ripening strawberries icing sugar and mixed peel. Too bad the flavors are profoundly bitter and minty producing an expression on this reviewer’s face like a flinching child reluctantly ingesting an unwelcome spoonful of medicine. More palatable and fruity as it dilutes some spearmint returns on the finish but it was game over by then."
122,10,"The wine cask anoints a gentle amber hue to this natural-colored whisky that has a nose redolent of wine gums. It has a firm texture with early promises of apple and blackberry but then the flavors tumble off a cliff; a mouth-puckering bedlam of unsweetened rhubarb cough medicine licorice and aniseed. A dash of water extinguishes many of the sour notes but any redeeming qualities are weakened too leaving it bland and saggy. Hard to love this one."
123,4,"Belgian whisky maker Etienne Boullion takes help and advice from Bruichladdich distiller Jim McEwan and it shows. Now the owner of the old Caperdonich stills and set for major expansion Belgian Owl is literally on the move. Let's hope it retains the greatness of this malt. This is the distillery's best offering yet: a sweet rich vanilla-laced fruity dessert whisky that is both refreshing and very more-ish. Alcoholic tinned fruits particularly pear."
124,10,"Other than detecting a note of burst balloons I enjoyed a warm rich comforting nose of nutmeg-sprinkled apple pie raspberry jam stewed plums allspice and prunes on this whisky distilled at the famous jenever powerhouse of Filliers. A lightweight citrus nose with vanilla tablet stewed fruits watermelon and a fusty grained texture. This settles down nicely with a few drops of water for a short finish of light toffee and hints of cocoa. €38"
125,4,"Belgian whisky maker Etienne Bouillon has a strange production process including maturation in modern warm and strip-lighted warehouses on an industrial estate but he’s no slouch when it comes to whisky making and he counts Bruichladdich’s Jim McEwan among his friends. This is melon and vanilla ice cream on the nose; banana burnt rind and a sprinkling of pepper on the palate. Youth reveals itself late but this is dessert whisky at its best. €47 Currently not available in the U.S."
126,10,"Rowntree’s fruit gums chalky Edinburgh rock root ginger and oat biscuits on the nose. It’s a double distillation of the mash for Gouden Carolus Tripel beer aged in first-fill bourbon barrels then finished for 6 months in custom-coopered Het Anker barrels. Those fruit gums are inescapable on the palate but there is malt warm toffee apple peach and a tingle of orange. Gingersnaps vanilla pod and building tanginess spill over in the finish which ebbs into a peppery haze. €37"
127,1,"Distiller Etienne Bouillon and two partners farmer Pierre Roberti and financier Luc Foubert established Belgian Owl in 2004 in the barley-growing region of Hesbay pressing a 19th century Swiss ambulatory alembic into service. Bouillon studied with Jim McEwan at Bruichladdich and The Belgian Owl shows something of the Laddie’s master distiller’s love of sweet spirit aged in first-fill American oak. Stir in some cream sweet peach guava and mango and you have a lush palate. The youth is indicated by a little green almond while there is a soft crunch of barley on the tongue. €46"
1062,9,"Subtly complex and nicely rounded. A bed of sweetness (caramel vanilla) peppered with honey-kissed fruit golden raisin and a hint of marzipan. Pleasing oak grip and dried spice on the finish. A great value for such a high-quality bourbon. (Loch & K(e)y exclusive)"
128,10,"The broad grin on the face of Mike Janssen speaks volumes about his enthusiasm for the beers and spirits he produces at the Wilderen brewery-distillery. This first cask from 2011 has a young grassy and herbal nose with orange peel artichoke and delicate black tea. Lithe yet warming flavors of citrus pleasant barley notes pepper spice and ginger but with creeping vegetal notes. It still needs taming but it’s early days. Ginger pepper and celery on the finish. (300 bottles) €60"
129,4,"Yep you read that right. A whopping 76.1% ABV. Belgian Owl has matured its whisky in warm and brightly lit warehouses so the spirit sort of cooks. You have to add water and add water and add water until…darn it you've gone too far. If you do manage to get it right—at about 46%—it offers nothing extra to what you get from the 46% version. Too much like hard work and really not worth the effort."
130,10,"The ‘Golden River’ was nicknamed after the color of the River Lys due to rotting flax. Here a cool breezy nose of lemongrass and almond paste meets aromas of black currant conserve and blueberry muffin as the sherry flavors try to cut in. There are initial dark jammy fruits hidden in warm bakery goods with damson bramble and malt swept aside by flavors of mint antiseptic and Fisherman’s Friends. The finish is clean and icy cool with penetrating aniseed. €38"
131,4,"This is very different to previous Belgian Owl bottlings but it’s important because it takes the distillery to a new place. There are hints of Glen Garioch or Springbank here with green banana skin raw barley and some peppery tomato. The fruity center just about survives the onslaught but it’s not an easy ride. €47 Currently not available in the U.S."
132,10,"From the Land of the Thunder Dragon comes this blend of 8 and 12 year old malts and grain from the Gelephu distillery. It’s clean light and fragrant with dried hay notes; like drinking chamomile tea in a tropical greenhouse. The thin flavors show custard tarts cracker bread and pencil erasers with a bitter aftertaste of burnt spices. So not so great as a sipping whisky but I’ve found it versatile as a base for summer cocktails."
133,5,"By focusing exclusively on high-quality straight whiskeys without neutral spirits Little Book is a fine example of America’s new era of blends. It includes all straight whiskeys: 4 year old bourbon 13 year old corn 5 year old 100% malt and 5 year old rye. Like Booker’s bourbon Little Book is uncut and unfiltered to preserve the full flavor. The dominant note cornbread still allows the malt’s sweetness and the rye’s spice to come through. This is the first release from Freddie Noe son of Beam master distiller Fred Noe and grandson of the late Booker Noe himself. It’s an impressive and unconventional debut as Freddie prepares to continue the Beam legacy. Number 11 in the 2017 Top 20"
134,2,"A nose of herbs candied oranges cherries treacle and baking spice with pleasant aged accents of leather armchair and earthy warehouse floor. The palate offers semi-sweet chocolate spice dark fruit roasted pecans blackberries cola and pepper. Water brings out richer chocolate pistachio and blackberry jam. The finish is nutty spicy and peppery with balanced oak and light fruit. Excellent complexity with spice melding well with notes of chocolate and fruit. (60000 bottles)"
135,5,"It opens with dark chocolate coffee hazelnut leather earth cornbread and maple syrup. Then it pops with brown-sugar butter melting over grits but the iron skillet cornbread reappears with a dominating and pleasing malt note. Hints of dill parsley and roasted almonds come next. Toward the end a burst of vanilla hits before a long finish with a hint of honey. As American blends go this is a fantastic pour."
136,13,"Metallica’s standard Blackened with the proof turned up to 11. The nose is nutty and sweet with pralines caramel corn brown-sugar butter and vanilla-almond ice cream. There’s more spice on the palate with Red Hots toasted nuts and oak candy apple and pepper. The finish is rich and warming carrying over many of the spices. Water elongates and opens the palate. This demonstrates excellent consistency from nose to finish and quality development over time."
137,12,"There’s personality galore in this blend of 10 year old Indiana whiskey finished in cabernet sauvignon casks and 11 year old Tennessee bourbon finished in rum casks and port pipes. Caramel honeycomb candy See’s molasses chips peanuts graham crackers cola mature oak and a little dill on the nose. The palate is chewy with dried cherries grape soda root beer candy roasted walnuts dark chocolate black pepper ginger graham cracker cinnamon cookie and lush leathery oak. Good development if you have the patience to linger."
138,12,"A blend of 3 to 5 year old straight rye and 4 to 12 year old straight bourbon. Although the nose is a bit reticent once it opens up what is revealed is pure delight: orange blossom iced tea dark berries lemon oil pine cinnamon nutmeg and leather. Fruit and spice enjoy a dynamic interplay on the palate with orange cherry blueberry and grape shot through with cedar cinnamon and sturdy oak. The medium-length finish is supple and pretty: dark chocolate toasted pecans and well-integrated oak."
139,2,"This marriage of the distillery’s own malt whiskey and blended malt from Scotland’s Highlands is finished 8 to 12 months in cider casks and released every fall. Autumn leaves minerality and earthy peat on the nose along with mulling spices apple and pear tart. A malty balance of vanilla cream lemon pie and caramelized sugar fills the palate followed by a lingering finish of spice and baked fruit. The third consecutive release of Cider Cask to score at least 90 points. (1902 bottles)"
140,2,"A blend of three whiskeys: one distilled from stout one from pilsner and one a rye. The nose has citrusy notes of lime followed by vanilla dried apple and pine. The palate offers more pine dried red fruits oak char and white pepper. Water releases blueberry vanilla bitter espresso and pecan. Orange peel and pineapple on the finish with dark chocolate dried figs and pine smoke. Balance depth and restraint. (898 bottles)"
141,12,"Not a hair out of place here. On the nose there are cooked bananas and poached pears with a wave of spices—allspice cinnamon cloves pepper and mace—as well as iced tea orange peel and the distinct aromas of a tobacco barn. The chewy oak-driven palate showcases blackberry jam cooked cherries peanut chews Coca-Cola ginger allspice dark chocolate and sassafras. It all ends with robust oak and a silky lengthy flavor of pecan-studded chocolate. 288 bottles"
142,8,"The additional year of aging in new American oak is readily apparent in this blend of American whiskeys. Dry toasty charred oak takes the lead before cherry cough drop cedar clove eucalyptus and toasted nuts emerge. The red and blue fruits are met with a jolt of spice that will delight rye whiskey fans before delivering earthy leathery tobacco leaf on the finish. Big in oak flavors but not overdone."
159,8,"Primary grain flavors of Cheerios and spirit notes of rubber tire suggest some youth here. The palate is very sweet surprisingly sweet in fact with cloying malt extract honey pear nectar and a bit of lemon oil. There are some redeeming flavors but this generally feels disjointed."
143,12,"A blend of American single malt and wheat whiskeys finished on staves from peated Islay scotch casks using Broken Barrel’s proprietary process. The effect is herbaceous rather than smoky; this has tons of eucalyptus bay leaves black pepper and juniper—more like an amaro in aroma than a whiskey. Dry and lean in the mouth there’s mint black pepper eucalyptus cola spices dark chocolate licorice and honeyed lemon tea. The finish is medium-length with oak mint pepper and persistent herbs. Profoundly outside the box but it works. (6600 bottles)"
144,12,"This is a blend of single malt whiskeys from a number of U.S. distilleries and malt indeed shines throughout. On the nose there’s cooked apple and pear with nutmeg chamomile milk chocolate and salt water taffy followed by a biscuity sweet palate packed with floral and stone fruit notes milk chocolate toasted almonds cinnamon and salinity. The dry round finish has vanilla biscotti gentle oak warm almonds and tobacco leaf."
145,2,"An 11 year old blend containing 16 and 11 year old whiskeys whose profile is inspired by gose-style beers. The nose offers sweet notes of bubble gum cherries blueberry pie candied orange caramel corn and cinnamon bread tempered by hints of eucalyptus and herbs. The palate is herbal and spiced with flavors of bitter chocolate pear tart and cinnamon. A mellow finish of dark fruit is dusted with cinnamon powder herbal notes and oak."
146,5,"A blend of 11 5 and 4 year old bourbons blended with 2 and 3 year old ryes. Pine cedar and cigar box offer a pleasant botanical and masculine nose that has slight hints of dill and roasted corn. It’s bright and extremely interesting with notes of Mexican chocolate strawberry and orange Marmajam rye toast and peanut butter. The medium finish offers a hint of wintergreen"
147,2,"This blend of bourbon and rye offers quince kiwi jasmine honey vanilla angel food cake sultanas and lemon meringue on the nose. The palate is somewhat barrel-forward but offers coconut banana flan maple syrup cinnamon roasted almonds and lemon with an appealing char note. The finish is gently spicy smooth and light ending with sweet vanilla and soft oak. Perhaps a bit closed at times and lacks some cohesiveness but it’s very easy to enjoy."
148,12,"A blend of high-rye bourbon from Indiana and a small amount of Colorado single malt. Black tea cooked stone fruits blackberry jam white pepper and cinnamon toast on the nose. The palate is sweet and light with hot cocoa mix toasted oak cola iced tea orange and clove that crescendos in a flash of heat and then subsides. Dried blueberries dark chocolate and integrated oak on the finish. Water not recommended. Best Value"
149,5,"Blend of 5 and 9 year old whiskeys aged in American oak and finished in Papillion (a French oak-aged red wine) barrels. There’s something to this with orange zest rose petals honey vanilla and cotton candy. Then a contradictory array of flavors abruptly changes the conversation. Think smoke: charcoal campfire marshmallows cinnamon with hints of white pepper and tobacco plug. Its medium-spicy finish captivates me even though palate and nose seem to be two different whiskeys. Very interesting. Sourced whiskey."
150,2,"A blend of straight whiskeys that’s finished in brandy casks using proprietary “sonic enhancement.” Sweet vanilla lemon cream pie spiced apricots ginger cracked corn and licorice start off the nose balanced against a soft influence of new oak. The palate is sweet and well-textured with notes of spice candied apple cooked plums chocolate nuttiness and a fair amount of barrel influence. There’s some good length on the finish which offers sweet flavors of light chocolate along with lingering spice and layered oak."
151,12,"Expressively aromatic with orange chai spices incense spearmint and Juicy Fruit gum buttressed by earthy moss and cedar. Equally vivid flavors of dry oak pepper cinnamon Red Hots dried orange peel orange pekoe tea and chili-chocolate but it loses steam on the finish. Water tames some of the brasher qualities without dampening the liveliness."
152,2,"A collaboration between the late Dave Pickerell and metal group Metallica this sourced straight whiskey blend was finished in so-called “black brandy barrels” for several weeks to the sound of Metallica’s music—a method aimed at enhancing the aging process. Dusty oak potpourri leather licorice vanilla and caramel along with banana raisins and plums on the palate. Bitter chocolate and spicy heat punctuate the finish with a light citrus note."
153,2,"A blend of 3 year old single malt (30%) 3 year old whiskey distilled from pilsner beer (20%) and 7 year old whiskey distilled from stout (30%). Unsurprisingly the nose is hoppy with an overlay of pine bough and a tropical fragrance of lemon and pineapple. The palate is deeper with more hops and pine plus bitter citrus lime and white pepper. The finish melds bitter chocolate roasted pecans and toasty oak. (3960 bottles)"
154,12,"American whiskey takes an unusual direction with this blend of straight bourbons from Kentucky and Tennessee straight rye from Tennessee and malt whiskey made by St. George Spirits. On the nose stewed plums and apricots orange gumdrops almonds earthy grain—spilled wine in the garden. A resinous and hoppy palate with poached pears cooked ginger lemon white pepper and milk chocolate-covered almonds. Lemon pith and mild oak on the finish."
155,12,"A blend of 5 year old Kentucky and 4 year old Indiana corn whiskeys finished on mizunara oak staves using Broken Barrel’s proprietary process. The nose is unusual with candied fruit grape Kool-Aid blueberries fresh coconut shavings Popsicle stick and a grassy character. Muted tropical fruit vies with oak on the palate which is silky; soon chile pepper and oak dominate. It finishes with peppery heat and sweet oak. (6600 bottles)"
156,13,"A blend of corn wheat and rye whiskeys there is a grassy and herbal note on the nose with licorice dill caraway seed and eucalyptus as well as a piney lemon quality with cacao nibs and sea salt. The palate is silky and light with a spiced herbaceousness chocolate chips mint and pine resin emerging with water. The finish is more of the same with mint chocolate bittersweet oak and a lingering heat. Earthy and green at times it recalls a pine forest with its sustained herbal and lemon quality. The lower proof and a light-bodied palate keeps it from scaling any higher."
157,5,"It begins with flowers cardamom fresh-cut walnut wood and mint. Notes of fruit pomace applesauce pineapple and vanilla-iced strawberries take over but smoke pear and apple dominate thereafter. A shorter than expected finish presents hints of chocolate candied corn and more smoke. Very nice for punches."
158,9,"A blend of straight bourbon and rye whiskeys. A younger-tasting expression when compared to High West’s original Bourye. Pleasant enough to drink neat or with a splash of water but that certainly wouldn’t be my first choice. Sweet foundation (caramel vanilla custard candy corn) along with honeyed fruit macadamia cinnamon nutmeg and soft mint. Comes across as a bit confused at times and the flavors aren’t always well defined."
160,12,"The nose is floral and grain-forward with green banana lemon pith Honey Nut Cheerios and wood spice. On the palate sweet whipped cream and lemon are overlaid by white pepper and Popsicle stick. It finishes hot and dry. A blend of whiskey made from a bourbon mash by Ko‘olau Distillery and 5 year old whiskey from Missouri."
161,11,"Alibi is a new blended whiskey: 27.5% 3 year old straight whiskeys 72.5% GNS. A new American blended whiskey? Give it a whiff: hot caramel a bit of fruit and store-brand vanilla. It’s hot in the mouth sweet with more caramel and vanilla fringed with cinnamon and oak. Not bad but it’s squeezed at its $24 price by perfectly good straight bourbons."
162,11,"“75% Grain Spirits.” Let’s get that right out there! Slight rose cast to the liquid and a smell of caramel and brown sugar. Thin with a hot finish but drinkable. Honestly while this is not something I’d even shoot with a beer chaser it’s hardly flawed; this is clean and makes a decent mixer."
163,11,"Odd aroma more like a weedy aromatic bark than honey; wonder what the bees were gathering from? Very sweet on the rich and cloying side but without the real honey character that makes Jack Daniel’s Honey the best of this bunch and I can’t get over the aroma. The only saving grace is that even at 35% the bourbon still manages to peek through; it’s not enough."
164,5,"Raw oak drywall campfire and glue open the sinuses. Then an antiseptic/medicinal property sets in with tobacco burnt wood and smoked paprika. Toward the end a generous helping of vanilla kicks in over a decent finish to save it."
165,5,"Four barley types—two row pale chocolate kiln coffee and Carafa—and malted wheat; aged 6 months in used Woodford Reserve Double Oaked barrels. Initial pungency and varnish. Then freshly-cut grass petrol wood shavings and a slight hint of chocolate. New make mouthfeel. A hint of honey and milk chocolate is quickly overtaken by an astringent finish. In another few years maybe this will become more palatable but this is far from ready and bourbon remains this distiller’s strong suit. 375ml"
166,10,"They blended Wild Weasel single malt with whisky from the Radermacher distillery (maker of Lambertus grain whisky) to create the world’s first blended Belgian whisky. It noses young with straw digestive biscuits damp woodlands oat breakfast cereals and a hint of spice saving it from nosing like a crisp Sauvignon Blanc. The mouthfeel is languorous with a musty texture some grapefruit acidity tangerine sweetness and a mild malty finish. So now we know. €40"
167,10,"Master distiller Jean-Marc Daucourt uses French wheat and malted barley in his distillations and ages his spirit in different woods noticeably Limousin oak. The nose brings marmalade newly unfurled bracken sanded wood on a workshop bench light pepper dried apricot and pineapple. It’s a well-balanced dram showing marmalade sweetness fruit pastilles lime zest and ginger which adds to the toasted spicy tingle. The creamy mouthfeel concludes with the spices in retreat leaving an orange hum. Some kind of wonderful."
168,10,"Named for the Port de la Lune of course the crescent arc of the Garonne flowing through Bordeaux. The company expects to start single malt production in 2017 in their new distillery but meanwhile enjoy this Sauternes cask finish with its white grape light honey floral and peach aromas.  Flavor delivery is all up front; peach syrup and soft toffees with some burnt spices on the finish. A character of its own certainly not an imitator."
169,4,"Described as 'French blended hand-crafted whisky hand-made and finished in French Limousin oak' this is a real weirdo. It's more interesting than many blends and quite likeable but it tastes less of whisky and more like a thin Southern Comfort with liqueur-like orange some menthol gentle spice and other aromatics. Hard to believe nothing has been added."
170,10,"Rich and sweet aromas of toasted coconut honey ripe pear green apple and honeysuckle. The palate is resplendent in golden honey creamy vanilla tangy peels and pepper with the higher ABV pushing it on and on. Compared to Hedonism Quindecimus and The Muse this is richer with greater complexity and the subtle interplay between the fruits is outstanding. Unforgettably good whisky. (2226 bottles) Collectibles"
171,10,"Buttery vanilla marzipan honey ripening melon orange water lavender and muted spices lead to a gorgeous rounded sugar-sweet palate of vanilla beeswax citrus ground almond and shortbread. Precision-engineered to ensure the exquisite flavor never stops. (3060 bottles)"
172,10,"How time flies! This eloquent blended grain marks CBWC’s 15th anniversary and the combination of these aged grains is idiosyncratic of whisky auteur John Glaser’s distinctive taste. Rich honey apricot stone crisp spices vanilla custard gentle oak char and tropical fruits promise a real reward. Succulently juicy with melon apple and caramel subtly paced with chocolate and dark fruit infiltrating. Slowly the sweetness depletes to black pepper and spiced roast meats. Defer swallowing for as long as possible. (5689 bottles)"
173,10,"With its inventive limited editions and contemporary design it’s worth paying attention to Royal Salute these days. Its first blend of aged grain whisky has aromas of peanut caramel ground pepper rye crackers vanilla pod fresh oak and stewed fruits. A rapid turnover of flavors: tangy orange shifts quickly to bitter orange followed by clove pepper chocolate and honeycomb then chocolate orange nougat and marzipan. It’s an even better dram over ice."
174,9,"An older more exotic expression of Hedonism consisting of 42 year old Invergordon and 29 year old Cameron Bridge grain whiskies. Straw gold color. This is richer and cleaner than most other grain whisky offerings which are often too thin and overweight with dry oak. Like many older grain whiskies creamy vanilla coconut custard and a variety of tropical fruits abound. Additional notes of toasted marshmallow caramelized apricot golden raisin and a gentle dried spice finish add complexity. Surely one of the better examples of this rather eccentric category."
175,7,"The debut release from Don Sutcliffe's Sutcliffe & Sons this small-batch blend of grain whiskies comes from several different distilleries including Loch Lomond North British and a 30 year old whisky from Carsebridge. The blend is married in first-fill sherry casks which brings bright fruit to a fairly light whisky with notes of blackberry vanilla honey light oak and iris. Quite good for a grain whisky blend but falls just short of being exceptional. (U.S. only)"
176,10,"Oat flapjacks golden syrup beautiful dry-roasted spice notes vanilla essence cornbread creamed coconut and flashes of mango and apple. A luxuriant feast of sweet vanilla soft warm bread whipped cream caramel a little tug of spice with a late ripple of grain flavors. Caramel spice and grain notes mark the finish."
260,10,"Who wouldn’t love this? Aromas of vanilla malt cream cake batter mashed banana and heady florals with a hint of dark fruit and dry spice. There is concordance between the nose and palate; the taste is sweet and honeyed with orange lemon and lime zest and well-integrated spices then becomes creamier with custard banana loaf a little dark peel and marmalade. Honey and citrus round things off nicely."
177,4,"Bottled as London's Big Ben began to strike midnight on the day that the word 'vatted' was outlawed in Scotch whisky terminology this is a mix of grains from different distilleries and does the campaign for more Scotch grain whisky no harm at all. Gossamer soft and smooth with a honeycomb heart and milk chocolate vanilla and the odd prod of spice it's a cushion of a whisky. Luxurious indulgent and well made. £125"
178,9,"Gold color. Delicate aromas of tropical fruits (coconut pineapple mango) marshmallow and vanilla. Light in body with delicate exotic flavors that deliver what the aroma promises. Soft gentle delicately creamy finish."
179,10,"A marriage of a single cask of grain from 1981 with a cask of pot still from 1984 to celebrate 30 years of Midleton Very Rare the job undertaken masterfully by Barry Crockett and Brian Nation. The expressive nose is redolent of polished antique violin warm gingerbread the herbal tinges pricked by spices. Delicate honey rich vanilla toasty oak and tendrils of cinnamon segue into a dry spicy conclusion. La Peregrina of Irish whiskey. Ain’t she a beauty? (117 bottles) €6000"
180,10,"Each MVR vintage has its own character and the latest version has a sweet motif coddled in a soft fruity bounty. Orange tartlets white pepper cantaloupe nectarine pear malt and rounded oak greet the nose. Honey and caramel with citrus pulped fruit and spice before a sweeter phase of tablet toffee and vanilla flavors on the palate. Spices only nibble at the sweet and comforting finish. Collectible"
181,10,"This blend of single malt and pot still whiskeys exhibits the incredible synergy between chocolate cinnamon and pot still spices. Vinous at times from partial cognac-cask maturation this has aromas of dark berry fruit cinnamon fudge milk chocolate malt biscuits jellied fruit and a smudge of dry spices. Compelling well-structured whiskey with cinnamon chocolate dark toffee pepper and ginger. It’s never cloying nor overly sweet just a richly rewarding glass."
182,10,"Midleton master distiller Kevin O’Gorman’s debut vintage accentuates the elegant nature of Very Rare and evokes an indulgent nose of rich caramel dry spices apple strudel vanilla fudge seasoned oak banana and toasted coconut. The palate revels in soft orchard fruits with a gentle undertow of spice bananas in custard and caramelized sugar. Including single pot still whiskey from 1984 this is fruit-led and so sippable. (Collectible)"
183,10,"A classic with its nose of toffee vanilla treacle tarts and fragrant pot still spices. Initially flavors of green apple red fruits toffee nimble spices caramel and vanilla before a minty master class: rubbed mint leaves become peppermint developing into After Eight mints then cool mints. Taste for a minute or more for the full experience. The smooth finish has clove pepper and bitter dark chocolate. Collectibles"
184,10,"Make way. The nose is dense oily and mesmeric. There’s vanilla sure but it’s the intense aroma of vanilla pods split and scraped at knifepoint. Woven around it there’s crème caramel and heavier cinnamon flaring at the margins softening with dilution but remaining sweet. The first Midleton to carry master distiller Brian Nation’s name is purposeful and assured lacking some of the sappiness of the 2013 release. This is less about succession more an emphatic statement of intent."
185,10,"Good complexity here with malt toffee clementine peel creamy vanilla flapjacks peppercorn and brown sugar sprinkled over baked apple and pear tarts. Beautiful flavors of sugared nuts orange fondant cream then wave after wave of intense spices. It’s wonderful neat adding lush caramel marmalade and nutty flavors toward the end. This is twice as scarce as last year so get your skates on. (2580 bottles)"
186,10,"Blended in Co. Clare this concoction of rare Irish whiskeys from 1991 is an utter delight. Honeydew orange frangipane rose Turkish delight vanilla icing and beguiling floral perfumes. Golden syrup orange oils vanilla and caramel sprinkled with lemon and lime zest; this has a slightly waxy mouthfeel that melts to become creamy and silken with heavenly spun sugar and candied orange slice flavors. (60 bottles)"
187,10,"This year’s edition contains some of the oldest whiskey they’ve ever put into Very Rare. A pronounced spicy nose with sweet barley dried apple crisp grains sweet baklava and squishy cubes of rose-scented Turkish delight. In the mouth it’s incredibly smooth and glossy; quite honeyed subtle soft fruits raspberry apple mixed peel butterscotch baked orange and a hearty spice core. A creamy finish where the spices outlast the fruit."
188,10,"Finished in fresh bourbon casks at Bow St. Distillery Dublin this batch has a greater intensity than the first. Baked lemon vanilla toffee ground ginger and snuff. Warm and fruity with sweet toffee notes the ginger root leads a high-intensity spice assault though the reassuring indulgence of the rich toffee never deserts you. Dried banana herbal notes and lemongrass outline the finish."
189,10,"A brilliant collaboration with the Los Angeles craft brewery the nose has red apple dry grasses orange pith toasted bakery goods and background spices. The beer influence is every bit as good as Caskmates IPA. The palate is classic Jameson: honeyed soft light fruit vanilla and peppercorn developing a wonderful creaminess dark orange further spices and lastly chocolate notes. Glowing and kind of dreamy."
190,10,"Of all the Caskmates this edition representing Brooklyn is more complex and offers a greater balance between the fruit and pot still spices than all the rest. There are bright floral notes citrus dry spices and roasted barley—everything in perfect harmony. Clementine honey nuts tropical fruit a few savory elements with finely ground spices fizzling away under waves of citrus fruit candied peel and flakes of chocolate."
191,10,"A dark brooding whiskey with a nose of cinnamon sticks nutmeg clove dark chocolate baked apricots and orange peel. The palate has dark toffee peppermint raisin and pronounced clove elements before a second wave of dark chocolate warm malted milk cocoa black pepper praline plum skins and licorice. No burn on the finish even at cask strength just some delicious chocolate and malty notes with a blast of spice for good measure. (2346 bottles; 186 for the U.S.)"
192,10,"This year’s liquid missive from head distiller Brian Nation has a nose of caramel macaroons and beeswax with green grassy notes. The first sip evokes barley sugar which grows into a citrus glow nourished by some green oak and a little white pepper. It has lovely poise this year effortlessly lighter on the tongue than the 2015 or 2014 creations. The conclusion is slightly nutty with soothing oak."
193,10,"Unmistakably Jameson on the nose this is a belter of a whiskey: honey apple toasted coconut creamy vanilla and sublime pot still spiciness. This offers sweet toffee and caramel bursting with spices just a hint of sherry Brazil nut vanilla creamy oak and a caressing mouthfeel. A triumph that exemplifies the glories of pot still blending and its sherry influence makes for a rich ending."
4196,6,"The nose offers tinned peaches fresh ginger and a slightly herbal note. The palate is voluptuous with vanilla malt vigorous spices and white chocolate. Lingering coffee and gingery oak in the finish."
194,10,"A stunning effort with honey sunflower seeds zested orange toasted flapjacks nectarine kiwi and lime with the citrus opening up with water. Superb to see a delicious drinkable cask-strength whiskey showing off its flavors this well: honey citrus sweet toffee vanilla pod and a spice blast of pepper before a soft flowing fruitiness is enveloped by ground ginger. Clove peppercorn and fresh ginger make for an epic finish. (5175 bottles)"
195,10,"Burning straw berries and allspice but the smoke from the double- and triple-distilled peated malts beckons you in deeper adding peppery barbecued meats tree bark and earthiness. The delicious palate brings stewed apple currants conference pear raisin turnover and brown sugar. Peat smoke infiltrates stealthily leaving a finish of dried strawberries and pepper. This is a superb nightcap dram and a great champion for smoky Irish blends. Editors' Choice"
196,10,"Walsh Whiskey has rarely released better whiskeys than those of 2019 which included two expressions made in collaboration with the Legaret family of Deau Cognac. Here they apply bourbon and French oak cognac barrels to the unique marriage of single pot still and single malt Irish whiskeys arguably the most premium interpretation of the Irish blend. Aromas of dark berry fruit cinnamon fudge milk chocolate graham crackers jellied fruit and a smudge of dry spices. Compelling well-structured whiskey with cinnamon chocolate dark toffee pepper and ginger; never cloying nor overly sweet just a richly rewarding glass. Number 10 in the 2019 Top 20"
197,10,"In its new embossed bottle this year’s vintage release has a complex evolving nose with a huge hit of vanilla backed by caramel nuts zesty citrus notes of lemon and lime fragrant ginger root white pepper orange hard candies and hints of marshmallow. Rich and indulgent flavors of shortbread graham cracker runny caramel dried fruit and citrus; the honeyed sweetness deepening to toffee notes loading up with more fruit and nuts. (1500 bottles)"
198,10,"Sumptuously rich and intense whiskey emerges from these double-charred casks; a seduction of butterscotch treacle toasted nuts scorched coconut raisin and vanilla essence. Secure in its deep-centered sweetness it revels in caramelized sugar dark vanilla pecan nut slice crème brûlée peppery spice and fleshy fruits gloomily submerged in sticky umber syrups. Memorable for its long satisfying toasted aftertaste heavy on the vanilla and raisins."
199,10,"This is so delicious that it makes you want to slip into the glass and join it. Coffee bean orange peel and fruit-forward dark chocolate bars then chocolate ganache cocoa powder black cherry and peppercorn. Wheat whiskey makes up 50% of the blend and it tastes of chocolate orange and milky coffee with a crashing wave of pepper and ginger spices. Vibrant dark fruits persist with a creamy chocolate finish. (3000 bottles for U.S.)"
200,10,"Ireland’s penchant for cognac-cask finishing continues to impress with this single malt and grain blend which marks the centenary of the death of company namesake and Irish nationalist Henry Egan who made tweed suits a symbol of protest. With a delicate nose of peach passion fruit white blossom lime pear rose water and sweet grain the cognac flavors coddle the palate with peach fudge a whizz of spice vanilla sponge and grapefruit. (5995 bottles)"
201,9,"After being around for about a decade it’s nice to see this whiskey finally being sold in the U.S. Soft sweet and silky smooth with creamy vanilla caramel toasted marshmallow and honey-kissed tropical fruit (mango pineapple coconut). I get most of the barley on the front of the palate with the grain whiskey components more on the finish. Something seems slightly missing for me to elevate this whiskey to classic status (some more pot still character perhaps?) but it’s still a wonderful blended Irish whiskey and so drinkable. Gather a bunch of friends and throw away the cork!"
202,10,"Highly fragrant and floral this single pot still and single malt blend exudes notes of vanilla fudge lemon and lime zest fresh fruit salad watermelon and green herbs. The full-bodied palate blasts a comet of orange across a night sky of vanilla light spices sponge cake apricot tart and stone fruit pastries with a finish of spice and creamy orange fondant. If anything it’s even more expressive with water. (3500 bottles 750 for U.S.)"
203,10,"Vanilla dark chocolate pepper ground ginger hard candy floral blooms Parma Violets and dried apple sing from this oloroso sherry butt-finished blend of 18 year old triple-distilled single malt and 8 year old single grain. Syrupy fruit textures with flavors of apricot conserve the European oak finds harmony with the orchard fruits gingerbread and pepper. Mouth-coating lingering finish of oak and dried banana. (5000 bottles)"
204,10,"The third in the Reserve Cask series this has wafts of sherry wood Victoria plum dark marmalade toasted almond polished wood ground nutmeg and dried pear. Warm fruits panettone and citrus peel precede a moment of nippy spice on the palate followed by red berries and caramel. This saves the best till last with a delicious final phase as milk chocolate and spice soften to end with Choco-Leibniz and dried fruit. (8000 bottles)"
205,10,"The nose slowly sheds aromas of peeled apple ripe melon pot still spices blackened driftwood caramel-drizzled dark cookies and milk chocolate. A whiskey of two halves: taffy candy apple peach almond paste and dried tropical fruit flavors then after cresting the spices it slips through caramels toffee and berry-studded chocolate to dwell on cappuccino. Printing the recipe of the whiskey styles on the label is a welcome move. (12000 bottles)"
206,10,"Brown-Forman deployed a triple-cask finishing process on mature sourced whiskeys involving virgin oak refill and sherry casks. A lovely fruity complexity ensues with blackberry apple-toffee notes malt vanilla and sherry influences. Butterscotch with nutty undertones herbal notes verging toward spicy and hints of dried apple red berries and a touch of leather roll into the finish. You want complexity intrigue and flavor for thirty bucks? Look no further."
207,10,"The association with this Denver brewery has produced a whisky redolent of crabapple tinned peach leather bootstraps vanilla pod roasted malt and spices left to blacken in the pan. This is a scrumptious whisky layered with mixed citrus honey shortbread and lashings of vanilla creaminess. The clove ground ginger and black pepper lay down a solid foundation superimposed with oak char and black coffee grounds in the latter stages."
208,10,"Sweetness and richness were my first impressions of this sourced whiskey blended at Boann Distillery and it’s the oloroso sherry finish that’s made all the difference. Apple barley sugar aromatic spices baked citrus cherry and dried apricot against a backbone of grain. Vanilla fudge baked fruit desserts and apple it’s rich smooth and creamy with swirling spices before returning to a finish of vanilla spice and dried apple."
502,9,"Drier than the 12 year old (reviewed below) with some darker fruit (black raspberry blueberry) marrying with the brighter orchard fruit.  Sweet up front - honey and caramel - with a peppering of spice (dried vanilla clove and cinnamon) increasing as the palate develops.  Dry oak spice finish.  Lovely!"
209,10,"This just makes me happy. The nose brims with pure blossom honey a dose of vanilla whole peach butter toffee and an uplifting floral bouquet. A soothingly sweet and syrupy smooth concoction; this light-bodied whiskey of honey caramel and toffee feels like it should be dispensed with kindness in regular doses from a medicine spoon. The epitome of uncomplicated easy-drinking bourbon cask-matured whiskey."
210,10,"Butter salted caramel vanilla fudge firm but tolerant spices—notably white pepper—red apple and strands of orange zest. After a juicy orange opener a delicious wave breaks over the tongue bringing toffee caramel cappuccino hints of chocolate and a good balance of spices. The finish is spiced fruit with notes of burnt butter clove and coffee. This signature blend is consistently one of their best whiskeys."
211,10,"Toffee apple nutmeg sanded oak and plenty of feisty spices behind the nose. The flavor is more refined with greater complexity; not overly sweet or fruity but a smooth-as-satin mouthfeel with shades of pear caramel covered in white chocolate nuts pleasant pot still spiciness rich toffee cocoa and red chili. The cognac cask influence is gentle and works well and it concludes with a hazelnut butter finish."
212,10,"Dried cherry orange peel and red fruits on the nose complemented by aromatic spices toffee hazelnut plum jam polished wood macaroons and a little oak toastiness. It’s thick and mouth coating with toffee fig nutty chocolate pepper oak char bitter cacao and dark cherry. The blend has a 35% malt content and spent a minimum finishing period of a year in oloroso sherry hogsheads."
213,10,"The Whistler is emerging as a standout Irish whiskey for the quality of its flavors. After a 15-month finish in Château du Breuil calvados casks look for aromas of caramel apple clafoutis pressed cider apples and layers of honey vanilla ground spice and floral top notes. Green apple honey barley and vanilla ride a tide of peppery spices leaving light brown sugar apple cereal bars and a long spicy finish. (3000 bottles for U.S.)"
214,10,"Sliabh Liag is the first legal whiskey distillery in Co. Donegal in over 175 years and though the blends are sourced this latest iteration is a big step up in quality. Soft fruit strong barley notes and graham cracker aromas with supporting grain notes stone fruits vanilla and orange blossom. The palate is soft and graceful offering orange fondant apricot peach nectarine ground ginger citrus peel and green apple."
215,10,"Chapel Gate whiskey aims to resurrect the lost art of the Irish whiskey bond. This delicious debut is built around parcels of aged single malt and grain sourced from County Louth. Fresh hay floral blossoms comb honey dry spice oak a crate of whole lemons and growing spices. Lemon sherbet clean vanilla and a peppery grunt resolve flavors of rich barley sugar and a hot pepper finish. (7000 bottles)"
216,10,"Ground cinnamon coriander seed nutmeg mustard seed spiced meat and the saltiness of sand-encrusted seashells combine with a powerful honey note fresh pear golden sultana and Cox’s apple. Quaker Oats golden syrup and chocolate-covered graham crackers with cherries set the scene though spices quickly engulf them. Perfect harmony is reestablished as it fattens out with cinnamon toffee. Bold robust and triumphant: just add a Dublin pub weekend crowd and you’re all set."
217,10,"Cereal-led aromas on a classic Irish whiskey nose with wood shavings straw crisp spices hints of honey burlap extra virgin olive oil and other savory notes. A scrumptious palate of lemon white chocolate soft-serve vanilla ice cream and sweet honey followed by tangerine gentle peppery spices hints of lemon and lime and an ebullient spicy aftertaste. Perfect for a lazy Sunday: There’s very little wrong with this. (Best Value)"
218,10,"Inspired by the Morrissey-Sullivan bout of 1853 this whiskey received a 6 month rye barrel finish which results in enticing toasty notes cinnamon bark malt and vanilla. The structure is light the flavors are delicious and it knocks you out with malt creamy vanilla active spices and a dry nuttiness. Give the finish an eight-count for its long lasting spices and good punch of sweetness."
219,10,"The importance of master blender Billy Leighton to Jameson cannot be understated. His whiskey expresses smooth creamy aromas with floral top notes; a treat of poached pear golden delicious apple and peppercorn spices. There’s a thick clingy mouthfeel with sweet barley sugar gingersnaps sultanas and a peppery flare. Undoubtedly the best spicy pot character of the three Whiskey Makers series and that warming spiciness plows on into a lengthy finish. €70"
220,10,"The trend for finishing Irish whiskey in beer barrels now connects Skibbereen and Castle Island Brewing Co. in Massachusetts creating this breezy dram with aromas of lemon curd shortbread vanilla frosting and dry spices with plenty of coastal character. Melon blossom honey and peach on the palate before a real creaminess develops smudged by gentle spices. The later phase has toffee oozing from lemon bonbons vanilla cake mix and more fruity richness. (3900 bottles)"
221,10,"This whiskey finishes its maturation at Bow St. Dublin the first time this former distillery site has been involved in any whiskey production since 1975. A beautiful balance between toffee spice and oak this has aromas of concentrated citrus polished oak tables caramels and nut brittle. A supremely smooth concoction of dark nutty toffee vanilla pepper clove and oak. The strength is epic. Fabulous rewarding special occasion stuff."
222,10,"Hoppy notes cloaking the crisp grains green apple and pomelo make for a happier marriage than its stout sibling. This is one of those whiskeys that continuously evolves in the mouth progressing from a sweet syrupy beginning of coconut macaroons apple and spices to a creamier plateau of citrus stewed fruits and chocolate. It departs leaving the tongue weighted down with peppery spice and cooked apple. Unexpectedly delicious. Value pick"
223,10,"Having spent a year finishing in virgin American oak this is imbued with aromas of green apple lemon curd barley green tea stewed gooseberries and pineapple. Sweetly tangy with lemon Jell-O candied peel orange curd sugar-coated gumdrops and submerged notes of pepper and clove with dry oak on the finish. Though not especially complex this is irrefutably delicious and has plenty of appeal."
224,10,"Fresh clean floral scents light honey golden syrup and a hoppy edge hail this latest collaboration created by finishing Jameson whiskey in barrels seasoned with Chicago-based Revolution Brewing’s Fist City pale ale. The taste begins with fresh hoppy notes slightly herbal with gentle spices and an active pepperiness that grows larger in the headlights. The long spicy aftertaste follows the vestiges of the creamy nougat vanilla and green apple flavors."
225,10,"Co-founders of New York’s The Dead Rabbit Bar Sean Muldoon and Jack McGarry add their own 5 year old single malt and grain whiskeys to their supplies of grog. Sweetness caramel vanilla and scents of dried fruits. The flavors captured in a light frame reveal citrus peel malt dark cookies a rumble of spice and conclude with dried peels dipped in chocolate. Drying with spice and orange. Decent whiskey for sure but a rather conservative first release for The Dead Rabbit."
226,10,"Rum-finishing specialists William Grant & Sons add to Ireland’s league of existing rum-finished whiskeys. The lush tropical fruit complexity is abundant with mango passion fruit dried papaya and green apple on the nose. Red apple flavors dominate with Demerara sugariness dried strawberry egg custard and toffee chews before drifting off into sweeter fruitier territory. Short finish with a shot of sweet nutmeg."
227,10,"Irish blends come in many different combinations but this tongue sizzler is malt and pot still whiskey only. Let the high alcohol blow off the glass to find spring blossoms pot still spices honey sweetness tangerine macadamia nut peppercorn star anise and fennel seed. A rounded spiced-orange note assertive spices then toffee nut oak and herbal tones with a finish of nippy clove and citrus peel. Dilute to taste. (3516 bottles)"
228,10,"An interesting experiment in single cask finishing involved transferring the whiskey into St Lucia rum casks for 6 months. This has dried papaya apricot barley notes hints of sherry and robust pot still spices. Vanilla fudge sweetness bountiful tropical flavors of passion fruit mango papaya—though never overtly sweet—it still has plenty of spiciness with later traces of chocolate café mocha and nut butters. (380 bottles)"
229,10,"Thinking differently led to this early example of modern finishing at Tullamore D.E.W. which marries the strong tradition of Irish cider making with whiskey. The nose shows off toasted waffle and sweet cider notes but green apple too and a prickle of white pepper. Credit where it’s due this tastes of sugared golden apple slices at its core with crisper cider elements caramel vanilla then pepper and clove."
230,10,"Named because it’s triple-distilled and matured in sherry bourbon and malaga casks this has a syrupy fruity sweetness with notes of red cherry green apple pear peeled clementine vanilla toffee and a generous helping of pot still spiciness. Orange and lemon segments red apple caramel Jell-O cubes tossed in powdered sugar and background spices make this sweeter and fruitier than regular Jameson though the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. (U.S. Travel Retail exclusive)"
231,10,"Aromas of apple pear vanilla and soft buttery toffees with herbal notes pea pods pepper and mixed spices. A creamy palate of poached pear white chocolate toffee jellied and jammy fruits spices and raisins with spices vaulting above milk chocolate in later phases. A finish of milk chocolate malt and pear lead to a spice-coated tongue."
232,10,"A roasted slightly smoky rendering of pot still spices rises to the top accompanied by a nose of chocolate brownies new pencils and dried dates. The mouth signals this as a contender for Ireland’s strongest whiskey: red apple and baked peach concentrate on the palate a whirl of spices shows flashes of green chiles and hot pepper sauce leaving flavors of nutty wheat bread and milk chocolate. Exposed flames prohibited. (6000 bottles)"
233,10,"Spicier and funkier than other Caskmates this is where Irish whiskey meets Scott Vaccaro’s brews from the Lower Hudson Valley. This is self-assured with dark ale aromas cinnamon bark grapefruit bitter lemon and some savory notes. The pot still spices work overtime complementing the dark honey apple and creamy beer notes. It feels a little out of focus with pulses of flavor rather than a smooth development."
234,10,"Aromas of honey vanilla extract dried banana and clove with green herbal notes of parsley stems and kale. Dark sugar sweetness vanilla baked citrus clove and peppercorn flavors though the spices don’t overwhelm the mellow mouthfeel and it rounds off with vanilla toffee sliced banana herbal grain notes and lingering spice. Worth getting to know this whiskey well to appreciate its full potential."
235,10,"This blend of double distilled single malt and grain has bourbon cask and American oak written all over it. The allure of spice vanilla cream cedar sticks malt cinnamon and banana chips draws you in. Burning brown sugar sweetness and vanilla toffee meet the snappy acidity from orange lime and pineapple goaded by pepper and cardamom bystanders. Undoubtedly a great session whiskey so throw away the cork."
236,10,"Cinnamon-roasted pecan nuts cedar sticks maple cookies and cracked black pepper make for a parched dry nose with alluring touches of sweetness and spice. Smucker’s Magic Shell chocolate warm fruity notes maltiness and pepper on the tongue. It’s so succulent with long spices and cocoa notes concluding a sophisticated experience. Quick go now before the stores close."
237,10,"Here they take a triple distilled blend of pot still malt and grain whiskey matured in bourbon and oloroso sherry and finish it in golden rum casks (a favorite finishing vessel at Wm. Grant). A soft relaxing sweetness emits from the glass showing barley sugars lemon bonbon vanilla and freshly-planed oak. The oloroso has been used sparingly but rounds off the lemon light fudge and hazelnut flavors. There’s a spicy last stand that burns brightly. A terrific composition."
238,10,"With Ireland’s proud heritage of brewing no wonder distillers are experimenting: The barrels used here come courtesy of Blacks of Kinsale. The nose is subtle and delivers a fresh spiciness with warm bread on a bakery shelf stacked American oak staves and a characteristic green hoppiness. Honey sweetness citrus peel lime zest cereal pepper and ginger then some late dark berry notes and fig before peppery spices thunder through the finish. (9400 bottles)"
239,10,"Triple distilled classic containing a blend of pot still malt and grain whiskeys this layers aromas of spice over toffee creamy banana light vanilla sharp green apple and zested limes. Aromatic spices quickly beat the established flavors of green fruits followed by vanilla fudge malty notes peppercorn and even a little oak char. This moreish well-structured whiskey retains its creamy mouthfeel throughout the active spicy finish. Best Value"
240,10,"This all-Ireland blend is resplendent in rich oloroso sherry aromas whole peppercorn concentrated raspberry coulis and blueberry notes as the triple-distilled single malt component lets the fruits shine. Its flavors start in a tight embrace with sherry fruit then break open expansively with plum cherry raisin black grape cinnamon spices and chocolate cigarillos. Now if you’re thinking you want this in your next Old Fashioned you’re probably right."
241,10,"Ahead of Diageo’s new Irish distillery opening in Dublin this release has a bouquet of grilled orange barley sugar Conference pear and vanilla cream laced with white pepper. The warm fruity palate with soft barley sugars poached pear moderate spices and tangy citrus becomes increasingly sweet with vanilla dominating proceedings in the later phase. Easy to like this makes me want to experiment and start mixing it up."
242,10,"Clean pure clinical aromas of a boutique with light lemon fondant vanilla and basil leaves. Icing sugar lemon almonds and sweet rose-scented Turkish delight flavors develop into butterscotch peppercorn ginger fudge and banana rounded off with ripe fruits melted butter dried apple sherbet raspberry taffy and raspberry bubble gum. Named after the exciseman that proposed to J.J. Corry’s daughter this whiskey has plenty of stories to tell."
243,10,"Blended from select stocks by Irish whiskey bonder Louise McGuane this new batch has a fine combination of aromas of lemon white flowers lychee peach lime grapefruit peel white pepper sliced cucumber and cold-pressed olive oil. Initially mouth drawing it has a medium-weight silky buttery texture that explores melon vanilla pepper cream-filled doughnuts and sweet banana with lemon and nimble spices on the finish. (3500 bottles)"
244,10,"This Cognac cask-finished whiskey has light airy aromas of vanilla cream heather honey golden syrup flaked coconut and whole orange. Baked pastries and tangy orange precede a mid-palate spice rush with grapefruit flavors building through a lengthy spicy finish. Several sourced Irish whiskeys use local water to cut down to bottling strength; Lambay uses water drawn from the island’s Trinity Well."
245,10,"Master distiller Brian Nation is really getting into his stride now. This vintage has creamed coconut Jersey milk vanilla desserts crystallized jellies fresh orange peel and dry spices. To drink it is to celebrate American oak; creamy golden polished with peach honey sherbet sugars butter frosting sponge cupcakes almond biscuits and Quaker oatmeal squares. Spices are reactivated at the swallow. You have a whole year to enjoy this until the next one arrives. Really there’s no excuse."
246,10,"Taking inspiration from the Proclamation of the Irish Republic issued during the Easter Rising of 1916 the nose has toasted granola blended honey sliced pear hay bales cracker bread wood shavings and gently roasted spices. Light to medium-bodied it’s a likable easy sipper with flavors of oat crisp cinnamon heather honey and the rounded fruitiness of banana apple and pear with sweet vanilla."
247,10,"Are you a bourbon lover with an untapped curiosity for Irish whiskey? I have a job for you. Try nosing out the cinnamon molasses sultanas tarte Tatin and sweet crème brûlée on Colum Egan’s young creation aged in first-fill bourbon casks. A brash combination of spice cinnamon cooked apple and pear caramel popcorn bitter vanilla and spun sugar which finishes with wood char burnt sugar and toffee apple."
248,10,"Bourbon barrel matured then finished in apple brandy casks as a limited edition this is more malty than their regular bottlings with aromas of melon lemon vanilla sour gooseberry and faint banana custard. It’s thicker texture rewards with sweet fudge vanilla ripe banana hints of pecan and spice though it’s bedded down within the dessert flavors. A lengthy finish of lemon curd."
249,10,"Named after the infamous gang that weaponized their flat caps by stitching razor blades into the peaks this whiskey threatens a nose of raisin banana bread Irish soda bread beer mash and dark honey. A lightweight mouthfeel with dried apple baked goods oat bars vanilla extract and pancakes slathered with maple syrup a spicy swallow and a finish of burnt fruitcake. An easy-drinking whiskey."
250,10,"Drink to the Boston Strong Boy the last bare-knuckle boxing heavyweight champion of the world. The nose is bright: apple pear vanilla pod lime zest orange peel puffy marshmallow and light toffee. As the gloves come off the palate rolls with the punches of malt apple vanilla and spearmint parrying jabs of brown sugar caramel and stroopwafels. It’s light on its feet and delivers nutty spicy finishing moves."
251,10,"Ahead of the distillery opening Michael Scully is working on a series of Clonakilty releases in the warehouse. His promising first release is bourbon cask matured with a nose of raspberry strawberry taffy roasted coriander seed star anise apple green fruits and smoldering cooperage oak. The palate brings mandarin light honey sweet oak creamy vanilla fresh banana peppercorns and custard. Vanilla sweetness and a welcome spicy buzz to finish. (3000 bottles)"
252,10,"Royal Oak Distillery’s flagship has a nose of ripe mango dried apple rings vanilla and fine spice with a curious additional note somewhere between pencil erasers and a tire repair kit. Its light-bodied frame showcases apple pie sweet cream caramel gingerbread custard and vanilla. Although no prizes for guessing this is a blend of malt grain and single pot still whiskeys it is refreshing and easy to drink."
253,10,"Satsuma peel mandarin segments butter biscuits dry oak bookbindings and hints of baking spices on the nose. Warm orange sweet vanilla creamy pudding sherbet and a mellow pepperiness on the palate but as the citrus theme swells a taste of grapefruit bitterness washes over it making for a sharp bitter finish. With its 46% malt content this has grace but seems a bit mild for a warrior pirate queen’s tastes."
254,10,"This blend is full of bold flavors: sweet barley oranges and lemons fudge and pastel-colored macaroons. There is plenty of body with vanilla brown sugar strands of citrus fudge and spice. It seems slow to warm up the flavors a little lost for a few seconds before it gets its act together. Lengthy finish of buzzy spices lemon peel and caramelized brown sugar."
255,10,"Care for a small batch bourbon-matured blend with a 20% malt content finished for 6 months in oloroso sherry casks? Thought so. Clementine ripe plum and a firm peeled-banana nose with vanilla warm citrus banana raisins and base notes of peppery spice. There’s plenty of structure and complexity on this well-balanced blend which ebbs away with red fruits and strawberry bubblegum. Continuously juicy with a butter toffee and white pepper finish."
256,10,"Uh-oh here comes trouble. Sourdough lemon toffee creamy vanilla banana bread and a few floral notes compete with the intimidating high alcohol. It begins with orange-shred marmalade fleeting nutty-chocolate notes and lots of peppery spice before a substantial onslaught of alcohol tramples the taste buds. Sure it can be tamed with water but is that really the point? Provocative hedonistic raw and reckless; I’m very glad it’s around. (5300 bottles)"
257,10,"Lemon drizzle cake hazelnut dried coconut strips iced sweet rolls filled with jam and whipped cream and a jab of ripe gooseberry are all on the nose of this blend of grain and single malt whiskeys. It’s sweet and light-bodied yet smooth and creamy with lemon bonbons vanilla butterscotch and hints of cooked fruits with a spicy finish that retains a fruity juiciness. A great reference point for bourbon cask-matured Irish whiskey."
258,10,"Blends of single pot still and single malt Irish whiskey without grain deserve their own category but there’s no use crying about it. Roasted spices Quaker Oats light honey and fresh apricot; a little reserved and demure. Golden honey sweetness light citrus green apple peach pit dried apricot cereal notes creamy vanilla and a firm strand of pot still spiciness. Dry spice heat citrus peel and a dark vanilla aftertaste."
259,10,"This is the whiskey that introduces the American journalist to Belfast drinking culture in Colin Bateman’s Divorcing Jack. The sherry cask maturation is the key; mouthwatering autumn fruits plucked from the trees cinnamon-apple cobbler and cocoa-dusted raisins. A smooth glistening dram from the North Antrim coast; weighty and fruity the sweetness turning to raisin chocolate bars. There is a lot to bite on. It slips away reluctantly leaving a long dark sweetness behind it. One glass is never enough."
261,10,"Ripe yellow fruits summer florals satsuma peel anise candy and unexpectedly a catch of smoke at the back of the throat. Interestingly the malt in this blend was made elsewhere on the stills now installed at the Pearse Lyons Distillery in Dublin. Mellow with tropical fruits melon and citrus. It becomes quite tangy with a growing dominance of spices ginger and pepper. Shades of sourness creep in heralding a light spicy finish. (KY GA and FL with expansion planned)"
262,10,"Lemon drizzle cake and finely shredded orange peel on this Barr An Uisce first-fill bourbon cask-matured blend of 21% malt whiskey and 79% grain that has enjoyed a 3-month oloroso sherry finish. With light lemon green melon and flashes of citrus it revs up the toffee and marzipan notes ending with a pleasing sweet swan song of caramel and white chocolate. A gentle dram for quiet times."
263,12,"The first whiff is that of a garden tea party: geraniums potting soil and floral and grassy aromas mingle with apple peels toasted coconut and vanilla. In the mouth it’s very light although the flavors that are present are enjoyable: vanilla cupcake lemon muffin toasted almonds and a hint of coconut. Simplicity that lends itself to easy drinking. (Costco)"
264,10,"The nose is a bit reticent starting with baked apple heaped with peppery spice then discarded coils of apple peels with hints of date roast beef and peanut but it never really takes off. A tasty autumnal dram with rich savory juices cooked apple dark toffee and background oakiness with the stewed juices of plums prunes and raspberries squaring off against a wave of spices. (60 bottles)"
265,10,"Master distiller Brian Nation has the most vital job at Midleton. His distillate-driven whiskey is light perfumed floral and ripe with succulent fruits of Galia melon apricots and citrus pith. A smooth creamy mouthfeel of barley sugars dried banana and lime zest ends with light vanilla sponge and orange frosting. Sucked Jaffa segments make for a quick finish. The most distinctive of the Whisky Makers trio where the grain and pot still contributions are clearly evident. €70"
266,10,"The double-charred first-fill bourbon casks deliver Madagascan vanilla paste dark-roast cocoa beans caramelized sugars and a wedge of pecan pie. Heightened vanilla flavors maple syrup a little chocolate coffee grains sweet char and those dark sticky softening pecans prized from the pie. Alternately sucking on vanilla pods and chewing leather bootstraps describes the finish. A one-trick pony some might say but it’s a highly distinctive and impressive steed all the same. (4800 bottles)"
267,10,"Initially Conor McGregor’s whiskey seems more laborious than notorious with a rather unremarkable nose of fondant orange and mediocre spices not helped by the first sip’s wishy-washy fruitiness of diluted orange and fudge but before you tap out it gets back on its feet and starts swinging for the fences with a redeeming comeback of gingerbread clove pepper charred oak and a knockout gum-tingling buzz of spice."
268,10,"A stronger grain distillate characterizes this malt and grain blend aged for under a decade. More forthright than the Original with mint leaves fresh orange dry spices lemon peel and the bouquet of aromatic florist’s grasses. Enticing soft fruits are subdued by the grain flavors of spicy green herbal notes and astringent clove although it mellows to a redeeming finish of sherry trifle and bubble gum. (KY GA and FL with expansion planned)"
269,10,"Named after the Irish victory over the Vikings at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 this has a nose of vanilla dusty spices old sweet-shop toffee dried banana and polished wood furniture. While the tasty palate comprises fresh green apple pear citrus fruits vanilla boiled candies and an appealing lift of spice this would be tastier still with a bit more weight behind it."
270,12,"Coconut cream orange peel vanilla and plenty of sweet grain permeate the nose and carry through to the palate which is uncomplicated and youthful; a creamy floral banana confection touched with lemon. Light and simple—if you like this style of whiskey this is a good option. (Walmart)"
271,12,"Ripe orchard fruits white flowers saltines green apple candy and a hint of floor polish on the nose along with pie crust that expresses itself as a sweet nuttiness on the palate. The flavors are simple—caramel roasted hazelnuts milk chocolate and orange—and the finish short. If you’re after an ordinary Irish blend this should do the trick. (Total Wine & More)"
272,10,"The man in question was John Mulgrew an unassuming Belfast bartender who kept his counsel and told no tales. Blended and bottled in the wonderful city of Derry this is a first-fill bourbon cask-finished whiskey brimming with honey gentle vanilla banana chips fresh florals dusty ground pepper and Chinese five-spice. It delights on the tongue with sweet golden syrup a satisfying nuttiness and corn. A smooth finish with a whimper of spices wrestled into submission."
273,10,"Master cooper Ger Buckley has the most significant job at Midleton. Named after the croze that he uses to cut the groove for the cask head these older-aged whiskeys give his rendition a broad back of toasted oak vanilla pods and cracker bread with dark sultanas from the oloroso sherry casks. This has a richer warm glossier mouthfeel showing toffee vanilla lump charcoal and black fruits. A shadow of bitter oak creeps in toward the dying moments."
274,10,"This final lesson in the Deconstructed Series teaches us of the cask influence of the wood. The nose is warm and inviting with toasted oak rich vanilla and bruised orchard fruit in a cider press. Sipping is rewarding: caramelized apple oily pot still spiciness toasted coconut crunchy oat bars cinnamon bark dark treacle pecans and plump raisins. The creaminess of vanilla custard develops with dilution. If you’re late for final boarding this is the one to grab. (Travel Retail exclusive) €36"
275,10,"They say that Jerry Thomas made Kinahan’s his whiskey of choice in 1862. A sniff today might reveal molten honey flapjacks dry grist and a fresh apple Danish (apple custard and pastry). The palate has a nip of lozenge sweeties more apples peppermint vanilla and a slow slide into chocolate lemon pith and cocoa. The 25% malt content presses home the flavor. Palate-coating. It’s a blend of fine quality and Kinahan’s revival adds to the resurgence of Dublin’s whiskey story."
276,10,"This is straightforward straight shootin’ Irish whiskey. Creamy country fudge toasted muffins glorious sweet malt waxed lemons and delicate spices on the first sniff. It’s light in the mouth with lemon curd juicy caramels and vanilla custard tarts: simply bursting with warmth. It concludes with spices twinkling on a malt theme. Have your Irish whiskey experiences only been with the big names? Go live a little. You ought to get this: sugar and spice and all things nice."
277,10,"This summons up plenty of snappy grain notes with green apple melon rind and zested lemon bumping into dried chili green tomato damp hay bales and a dose of spice. It’s sweeter than a kitten with a ball of wool: lemon bonbons toffee vanilla cream banana chews zesty mandarin apple butterscotch pepper and clove. Sour apple pips burnt sugar and spice and some residual vanilla creaminess see it out."
278,10,"Named for the greatest London-Irish band of the 1980s this produces stewed apple raisin vanilla cream peppercorn grated nutmeg and a dirty ol’ mound of dunnage earth. A fiesta of apple pineapple grapefruit bitter lemon subdued honey and caramel transition into stewed apples rhubarb lemon bonbons and sweet vanilla. Lingering bitterness like the band’s split. It’s a Big Apple Fairytale but for the money better streams of whiskey are available."
279,10,"The second installment in the deconstruction of Jameson Original this is a punchy pot still-led whiskey with a nose of white peppercorn cinnamon breakfast cereal whole nutmeg and a chocolate-coconut slice. Soft waxy beginning strong vanilla flavors golden syrup fresh apple and huge barley notes though the spices are surprisingly easygoing. It’s worth comparing to its brothers Lively and Round. Of the trio this is closest to Original. Peppery finish with long lasting barley sweetness. (Travel Retail exclusive) €36"
280,10,"Meet the undisputed driver of the Irish whiskey resurgence. The nose is light with baked apple strudel toasty staves and hints of the bourbon and sherry cask influence. There are discernible pot still elements contributing a fruity character and plenty of weight. This dominant triple distilled whiskey is smooth sure although that characteristic improves noticeably up the range. Expect Braeburn apples raspberry strawberry currants and mixed peel with a short finish of cinnamon spice and a dull fruit note."
281,10,"Folklore tells of the Silkies whose siren voices and beckoning limpid eyes were irresistible to any man. From the team planning to build Sliabh Liag Distillery in County Donegal comes a palate of vanilla fudge wood spices and some vegetal notes following a nose of cold toffee brittle fresh-cut herbs and white pepper. A conspicuous grain character penetrates through but this adds to a mature profile making this blend stand out from the crowd of bourbon cask sweeties. €47"
282,10,"I loosen up my shoulders and crick my neck first left then right: this is strong whisky. Creamed coconut a little fudge hints of nutmeg unpeeled bananas and quite a young grain character on the nose. Powerful: West Cork firing on all six. Sweet charred wood caramel macadamia nuts and cinnamon toffee emerge unscathed. Settles down obediently with water: cinnamon toast and tasty caramels. This can handle plenty of water though ultimately the flavors still arrive at the same destination. (4800 bottles)"
283,10,"A limited edition blend of malt and grain whiskeys from some of the company’s oldest Irish stocks aged in a combination of bourbon port sherry and Madeira woods. The nose of vanilla slice marzipan baklava iced buns and hay bales suggests that none of the cask types take overall charge. It’s mild and mellow with rolling spices honey melon baked lemon and red berry fruits. Tranquil easygoing: a moment of Zen. €125"
284,10,"Aptly named after an inferno from an 18th century hot air balloon tragedy. Kaboom! The alcohol singes the nasal cavities baying for you to succumb but there is underlying maltiness tight currants leather bootlaces allspice cherry stewed apples and damp warehouses. To taste: fire in the hole! At full power it strafes the taste buds into submission leaving them numb and cowering for the abatement of the peppery dry finish. Brawn vanquishes subtlety. Douse liberally."
285,9,"This whisky is in between the ""Original"" Tullamore and Tullamore Dew 12 year old in age and price range and it also fits between the two in flavor and quality.  I thought that maybe this whiskey would have a more distinctive character to it (sherry cask aging different proof etc.) compared to the other two given that it is a limited edition of only 900 cases and so close in age to the others but it doesn't.  It's not that this is a bad thing but rather just 'more of the same.'
It certainly is a pleasant enough whiskey - well balanced not aggressive yet with enough maturity and pot still content to make it ""sip worthy"" if one chooses to do so.  Rather than buy the standard Tullamore Dew for mixing (or drinking on the rocks) and the 12 year old for sipping you can reasonably cover your bases with just this one bottle of 10 year old.
Rating for Original Tullamore Dew: 80 (it has gotten better over the years); rating for Tullamore Dew 12 year old: 84."
286,10,"Cork’s Franciscan Well brewery borrowed some whiskey casks but now Jameson has taken them back to make Irish whiskey aged in craft stout barrels. On the nose roasted coffee beans 70% chocolate green apples juicy cantaloupe and a buzz of hops. The thick creamy mouthfeel tastes of stout with strong chocolate and coffee notes and a tight spicy finish. Perplexingly experimental in results. A whiskey for stout drinkers? A stout for whiskey drinkers? Incomparable to other Jameson. Funny peculiar. €45"
287,9,"Great malt flavor for a blend; creamy with honeyed vanilla soothing caramel lively summer fruits golden raisin subtle date and butter cookie. Well-balanced very clean with no harshness and very drinkable!"
288,4,"There's absolutely nothing wrong with this and out of context its rounded fruity and sweet taste is perfectly acceptable. But it's standing in the company of giants and when compared to the steady stream of world-class Irish whiskeys over the last year this just doesn't cut it. The 12 years in oak don't seem to have added much to the story the alcoholic strength means it lacks real bite and the flavors are bland in this company."
289,4,"To a great extent this is traditional blended Irish whiskey by the numbers. Its problem — through no fault of its own — is that it’s bland compared to the wave of full-flavored whiskeys that have been released of late. The twelve years in cask don't add much to the standard Tullamore Dew beyond a sharp note. The apple and pear flavors are perfectly acceptable however and the whiskey's pleasant enough; it's just not very exciting."
290,10,"Cinnamon bark oak overripe nectarines salted peanuts and faint herbal notes open up this blended whiskey housed in the bottle with the clever geographical label. The structure starts light on the first sip with Golden Delicious apples and honey lozenges but then it thickens up mid-palate when the spiciness kicks in. Then it peters out. A decent spicy buzz finishes this perfectly serviceable blend composed by these determined newcomers to the Irish whiskey scene."
291,10,"Hands up if you’d ever wondered what would happen if you seasoned old bourbon barrels with fermenting Irish cider then added a triple blend of whiskeys? Anyone? Fizzy sherbet green foliage and cider (not apple) notes that’s what. Seasoning suggests the cask occupants are less than good mates the cider more a lingering tenant. Pot still surfaces through the saccharine cider flavors with coiled Bramley apple peels citrus strands and a nippy spiciness. Just because you can doesn’t mean you should. €54"
292,10,"Look out! This new Irish blend is named after the razor-nailed sharp-toothed hoodlum who gained notoriety with the Dead Rabbits fighting gang. The nose comprises whole orange peel boiled sugar and dried peach pits. Sherbet fruit polos apple baked almond slice and digestive biscuit make for a sweet palate. For real street cred Maggie needs more backbone: the thin mouthfeel needs more weight and structure. The finish is precipitously swift. Rather ordinary though I wouldn’t tell Maggie to her face."
293,10,"Explore the grain side of Jameson’s personality in this first specimen from the Deconstructed series. Expect floral aromatics and a mixed crate of fresh citrus fruit so it smells closer to the airport’s perfume counter than the whiskey store. Strands of honey squeezed citrus and vanilla blossom amid a thickening mouthfeel after a feather-light beginning. It’s tooth-achingly sweet but daubed with lime and sweet clementine leading to a dry warm finish with chalky candy. (Travel Retail exclusive) €36"
294,10,"A nose to savor and get lost in contemplation with its array of beautifully layered wood spices interwoven with balanced smoke polished wood vanilla pod and lemon-scented biscuits. This new edition has a waxy feel with sappy flavors of star fruit preserved lemons Asian pear lychee peach syrup and an underbelly of moody spices. The spicy finish retains a residual sweetness."
295,10,"Blended from imported whiskies along with Chichibu the component whiskies in blue label are at least 10 years old but often much older. The aromas tease with barley sugar smoked venison aromatic pan-roasted spices peppercorn and smoked paprika. Pepper and root ginger pummel sweet orange flavors of sherbet and Creamsicle. The citrus sweetness sees off the hefty spices leaving the mouth awash with creamy orange peel notes and tropical fruits."
296,10,"Captivating enticing and wonderfully charming this first blended malt from Chivas Regal contains selections of five Speyside malts: Strathisla Longmorn Tormore Allt-a-Bhainne and Braeval. Red apple cherry raspberry fudge peach and mango fruit salad dusting of cinnamon and dry heather sprigs. In essence it’s rich and satisfying with dark vanilla apricot Bourneville-covered Brazil nuts and tangerine smoothed over by caramel and wood spices maltiness and gingersnap biscuits. Quite heavenly. Editor's Choice"
297,4,"With a name inspired by a 1926 Buster Keaton movie only 1698 bottles produced and the news that one of the two batches is more than 30 years old the clues were there that this blend was never going to be cheap. It isn't but it's superb rich in flavor that screams dusty old oak office fresh polish and Sunday church with spices oak dried fruits squiggly raisins and a surprising melting fruit-and-nut dairy chocolate back story."
298,9,"A marriage of three different single malts aged in American and French oak. This whisky shows the advantage of marrying whiskies from more than one distillery (when properly done). Vibrant with a complex array of fruit (orchard fruit sultana) sweetness (light toffee marzipan honeyed malt) spice (creamy vanilla mocha warming pepper) smoke (tar smoked olive coal) and lesser notes of toasted almond and beach pebbles. More smoke and tar on the palate than the nose yet always in balance. Well played! (Editor's Choice)"
299,9,"The formula for this whisky has changed slightly since its inception -- and I think for the better. They've added some Laphroaig into the mix of Caol Ila and Ardmore. This whisky demonstrates the layered complexity that can be achieved by marrying whisky from different distilleries and different regions. I particularly enjoy the rich maltiness and oily texture that provide firm bedding and flavor contrast to the classic Islay notes: tar boat docks brine smoked olive seaweed and kiln ash. More subtle cracked peppercorn mustard seed and citrus fruit add complexity. Long warming finish. Amazing how a small change in composition can significantly benefit the overall flavor profile of a whisky."
300,10,"An incredibly complex creation using stock from Diageo’s 28 operational single malt distilleries this has minted toffee gummy bears raw gooseberry fresh whole grain bread and earthy spices shaken over sweet banoffee pie. Rich fruit cocoa granular white chocolate dark citrus waxy caramel bars nutmeg cinnamon and bitter dark chocolate. Water stimulates green fruit notes. A beautiful sugared almond note materializes with sweet fudge and dried apple dipped in chocolate. £125"
301,10,"Refined elegant smoke quayside ropes liniment oil waxed lemon cake mix ripe peach and a buoyant maltiness as Flaming Heart roars back with a vengeance. After the controversy surrounding the 15th Anniversary edition this time it’s all about the whisky. Sweet tangy orange bitter peel oils dark chocolate clove peppercorn and nutmeg glide into menthol spice beeswax and espresso on the finish. Solid gold: this is what they do best. (15050 bottles and 800 magnums at $330) Editors’ Choice"
302,4,"If you want proof that blended malts can be world class you'll find it in any bottle of Blue Hanger. Lovingly created by Berry Bros. whisky maker Doug McIvor every release has been exceptional. Even by the series’ own high standards this sixth release surpasses itself. The nose is fresh clean and citrusy with wafts of sherry. But there are smoky hints too. And it's that peaty earthy note on the palate that gives this release a new dimension enriching the fruity Speyside sweetness at the whisky's core. The age and quality of the malt asserts itself throughout. This really is stunning stuff. £68"
303,10,"Aromatic with smoke this lays down thick chocolate ganache toffee banana and salted caramel. It bowls you over with chocolate-dipped sultanas soft melon and ripe berries ahead of a spicy middle section replete with pepper coriander cinnamon fig rolls baking chocolate and a dry finish of cocoa and peppery spices. As blended Islay malts go pretty special."
304,10,"There has been an excellent streak of Islay blended malts recently and here is another worthy contender from the Spencerfield Spirit Company. This one offers the sizzle of bacon fat thick clods of peat cocoa and breezy smoke. The rounded palate has sweet satsuma spice generous malty notes and burnt caramel. The wafting smoke builds until it engulfs the back of the palate. You will be wanting one of these."
305,10,"Recognizably Spice Tree but it’s richer more dapper traveling in style and wearing better shoes. Peanut brittle toasted coconut and pale light sherry. Honeyed palate with caramelized sugar red apple and red berry fruit before the gingersnaps and clove bite. It revs up with another spicy blast for the finish. A tasty fifth Tenth Anniversary bottling from Compass Box; just don’t let yesterday take up too much of today. (12240 bottles)"
306,10,"Without dredging up all the brouhaha over the particulars of the component malts this exemplary whisky has a balance you could rest on a pinhead. Earthy peats discarded fish boxes and crisp bacon rind combine in a smokiness you can really get into while there is honey sweetness macadamia nuts and a bouquet of early summer flowers. It dances upon the tongue sweet with toasted spices anchored by dark citrus and with a telling waxiness to the mouthfeel. Get some."
307,10,"Butterscotch and smoke with rewarding maritime and medicinal characters balancing the sweetness candied peel poached apricots and lemon squeezed over warm sugar-sprinkled pancakes. The smoke billows up around the citrus-tinged caramel cotton candy marmalade and dried fruit. Wave after wave of spices ride the smoke trails through the finish carrying along some residual caramel sweetness."
308,4,"This has long been a core whisky for Compass Box but the latest version of it is spicier and fresher than I recall and without doubt it's my new best friend. Virgin French oak heads help to contribute oriental and aromatic spices on the nose with hints of melon and pineapple candy sweets. The taste is a delight with spearmint soft toffee sweet citrus fruit lemonade mixed with beer and strawberry wafers. An array of spices from cinnamon to chili to ginger dominate the finish."
309,10,"Peat has grown up to become the best version of himself that he can be. The mellow sweet smoke makes all your cares drift away. It’s like walking on an Islay beach through seaweed stranded at the high-tide mark. Lemon lozenges Sweethearts flashes of citrus stewed apple and growing smoke. The gentle glossy mouth-coating finish generates an urge to expertly puff smoke rings out through pursed lips. (300 bottles) £175"
310,10,"You are missing a trick if you don’t snap up these small batch blended malts when you see them. Savory beef juices black fruits particularly black currant loose Keemun tea and dense oak characteristics. Sweet baked orange with notable alcohols initially then tangy with caramelized brown sugar butterscotch dark rum Brazil nut pepper cacao and black currant puree. With water it tastes deliciously of chocolate. A serious heavyweight whisky."
311,10,"Jim Beveridge delivered these aromas of toffee apple peach and rich berry fruits by working with European oak casks. The smoke is timid with hints of background salinity. The finely structured mouthfeel is where this triple malt whisky truly shines: the polished smoothness is exceptional. The flavor journey begins with honey citrus and swirling melted chocolate building to a fire of squeezed orange oils dry fruits and pecan nuttiness before concluding with rich espresso dark caramels and plain chocolate. Immaculate."
312,10,"Following the Spice Tree recipe of 60% Clynelish 20% Dailuaine and 20% Teaninich Extravaganza’s core was matured for more than four additional years in light/medium toast refill and heavy toast hybrid casks of American and French oak. Finally sherry-matured Glen Ord Benrinnes and Allt-a-Bhainne were added to the mix. The elaborate process is typical of maverick blender John Glaser but it’s his results that count. Flavors of peanut brittle toasted coconut and pale light sherry translate into a delicious honeyed palate of caramelized sugar red apple and red berry fruit. Ginger and clove provide further rigor before a finish of incendiary spices. Number 7 in the 2017 Top 20"
313,4,"Launched a few years ago with a Dr. Haddock-like cartoon figure on the label Big Peat does just what it suggests it does…and then some. It's a mix of Islay peated malts and includes some Port Ellen but don't get distracted by that. Instead indulge yourself in the biggest peatiest oiliest earthiest grungiest gunkiest slab of industrial malt this side of a leaky steam engine. This whisky just gets better and better."
314,2,"The much-beloved Peat Monster was recently given a new recipe designed to create greater depth and elegance. The peat influence while still omnipresent is now more subtle. On the nose it’s gentle and fragrant wafting over candied citrus lemon-frosted cake and raspberry along with classic peated undertones of charcoal and iodine. The palate is creamy in texture with pleasant notes of brine seashells ashiness and a floral peat influence that swirls gently around rich vanilla tropical hints of lime smoked meats and generous spice. The finish offers bitter chocolate lemon hard candy and a bang of spice and smoke. Number 9 in the 2020 Top 20"
315,9,"Balanced Islay whiskies combine peat smoke characteristics with a sweet foundation. They’re not one-dimensionally smoky. This whisky is an excellent example. This is a peat-laden whisky with refinement and grace. Creamy vanilla caramel and honey harmoniously marry with persistent -- yet controlled -- peat smoke. Crisp spice notes and dancing fruit throughout adds complexity. Well done."
316,9,"(Exclusive to Park Ave. Liquors New York NY) This is a vatting of two single malts: the malty and sometimes smoky Ardmore and the always smoky and spicy Caol Ila. The whisky expresses smartly complex aromas of smoky bonfire smothered with peat with notes of tar olives freshly ground pepper and seaweed. A sweet maltiness (from the Ardmore?) binds the flavors together. On the palate the whisky begins sweet then the powerful peat smoke emerges yielding to olives peppery spices and seaweed. The finish is long and powerful with the peat smoke again emerging and lingering on seemingly forever. A monster indeed. This whisky’s complexity demonstrates the virtues of vatting. Many smoky whiskies have nothing else going on behind the cloak of smoke. This one does."
317,10,"Marginally less aggressive than in 2014 this Big Peat is more rounded and exhibits greater finesse. Overall it’s a better whisky. The invasive smoke still infiltrates the skull and clasps your brain tightly. A sweet smoke of smoldering hillside wildfire extinguished by rubber beaters balanced by meadow flowers tree blossom and honey. Sticky lemons smeared in thick honey cracked black pepper and a fabulous almost gelatinous texture it builds solidly in peaty intensity. Knockout! A hot smoky finish like dragon’s breath."
318,10,"Chocolate-covered raisins scoffed on a heathery moor leather riding tack intense plain chocolate malt loaf mixed nuts Medjool dates and traces of wood ash. A gorgeous unctuous mouthfeel with flavors spun around bright sparks of orange dark toffee and rich maltiness melding to black cherry stewed fruits licorice and charred oak. Named for the leather golf balls packed with goose feathers used in the early 19th century. Sink one for a birdie. From the bottlers of Sheep Dip. £39"
319,10,"Comparatively speaking this is a little monster for peat-loving monster hunters. Lemon attractive florals pine forests and gentle peat smoke. Sweet flavors cascade through honey lemon candied peel and vanilla fudge heading toward sweet cinnamon chocolate clove and a dry finish of oak and straw bundles. The neat touch here was filling cask-strength Peat Monster into custom French oak casks. A very fine blend indeed. (8328 bottles 3900 for U.S.)"
320,4,"In my book the bar can't be set much higher than it is for Flaming Heart and this latest version doesn't disappoint though it does head off into a scuzzier grittier and more peaty direction than the 10th anniversary bottling and has lost some of the black currant fruitiness in the process. No matter: this smolders with peaty and fishy intensity works its way round to tinned strawberries damson and berry fruits and emerges sooty and smoky. A BIG whisky."
321,10,"It’s the intensity of flavor that just grabbed me by the lapels and spun me round. It harbors intense tangelo juiciness; that unparalleled concentration of deep citrus skillfully mingled with dark vanilla dried apricots and gentle smoke. This goes the distance delivering wave after delicious wave: peach juice mandarin pineapple cubes and lemon zest. A firm unctuous finish shows a little charred wood and dark sugar cloaked in fine smoke. Tongue pleasing and very special indeed. £90"
322,4,"From whisky connoisseur David Stirk's Exclusive Malts Single Cask Cask Strength range this is a blend made with 80% malt and it shows. This is a beauty. It's also a ‘traffic light’ whisky with the sort of whisky rancio associated with the oldest whiskies up front peaches and cream and pureed fruit in the center and changing to oaky spiciness late on. Whisky with body depth and balance which morph seamlessly. Very good indeed."
323,4,"Peat Monster is a staple Compass Box blended malt whisky but this raises the bar significantly. The nose is “as you were”: peat reek seaside very Islay. But on the palate John Glaser's added some peaty Highland whisky—probably a signature Clynelish—to add a hint of licorice a softer fruitier smoke base and through some virgin French oak a delightful spiciness. Compass Box is in a purple patch. Again."
324,9,"A marriage of Dalmore Fettercairn and Ardbeg and their personalities certainly show. The whisky was blended and then aged for an additional 15 years -- very atypical. The marriage of the three really works very well combining a rich sweetness (honeyed malt toffee) with spice brine vanilla bitter chocolate charcoal espresso tobacco cigar ash subtle marmalade and firm -- but not dominating -- leafy peat smoke. Thick nicely-textured body too. Lingering brine and smoke on the finish. Delicious as it is I can only imagine what it would be like bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered. (I probably would be bumping it up a few points.)"
325,12,"The nose is thick with bakeshop aromas: sponge cake filled with marzipan and thickly frosted with buttercream; butter pecan ice cream; and vanilla bean. It’s consistent on the palate but more complex with roasted lemons vanilla malt powder milk chocolate cinnamon candy pie crust and buttercream frosting. No deviation on the finish which is pastry-rich and dessert-like veering toward flan. Westport is a “teaspooned” malt comprising mainly Glenmorangie with a bit of Glen Moray. (170 bottles; 90 for U.S.)"
326,10,"This new recipe Monster brings aromas of waxed lemon and firm peat smoke layered with charcoal iodine Band-Aids custard creams and blowtorched peaks of lemon meringue pie. Vanilla fudge and white chocolate on the palate quickly succumb to a dustbowl of aromatic peat smoke bristling with spices. Lemon bonbons and honeydew leave hints of cocoa to finish. This type of monster you do want to find under your bed."
327,10,"Sun-bleached driftwood iodine curry spices and hot asphalt with a highly charged aromatic smokiness: a combination of peat kiln and crackling moorland blaze. There is serenity too with soft cream ripe citrus and key lime pie. Thick and glossy it’s an intense mouth-puckering cask-strength prospect. Chocolate cinnamon and mint collide with a barrage of clove and barrel char. Booming spices reverberate in the grip of an extremely long finish. £155"
328,4,"The original Big Peat was a mix of smoky Islay malts and was already up there with the very best competition in the category even though many of the others were bottled at cask strength. I scored it at 90. Now it’s back to play in the big boys' pool with a killer cask strength whisky of its own. This is to whisky what AC/DC is to heavy rock: old school predictable but great and exactly what fans want."
329,9,"Compass Box Whiskies celebrates the fifth anniversary of The Peat Monster by thinking big: bigger intensity put into a bigger bottle. This bold whisky is packed with Islay and coastal character showing tarry rope brine and a hint of seaweed along with teasing smoked olive anise and mustard seed. There is some civility to the whisky: sweeter notes of vanilla wafer baked apple ripe peach and cream attempt to soften the blow. Smoke and tar on the finish. Nicely done. (Price is per 1.75L.)"
330,4,"What a success story. After six releases in a decade there have been three just this year. This release is especially for the States and it's a fireball. There are dried fruits and dusty bookshelves on the nose and tropical fruits with water. On the palate it's a big peaty rich whisky with licorice and more of the pineapple kiwifruit and guava. You get the whole fairground in the finale with candy fruit and smoke. Excellent."
331,4,"This Blue Hanger has sherry and fruit on the nose but it's all reined in. Then the palate is big rich complex and fruity and late oakiness from some 30 year-plus malt in the mix brings the perfect finale. £61"
332,12,"The nose starts with caramel-coated shortbread sprinkled with sea salt then opens to reveal crushed almonds raspberry jam grilled pineapple and a whiff of sweet peat smoke. Those raspberries explode on the palate which is fruity and sweet but counterbalanced by brine nuts and smoke. The texture is oily and a bit waxy mouth-coating and lush without being heavy: a slithering snake indeed and pure elegance. (500 bottles for the U.S.)"
333,10,"Seashells brine warm toffee peat smoke chocolate bars sun-crisped seaweed and dry aromatic spices with augmented smoky notes if you leave your glass for ten minutes. Sweet honey spun sugar lemon Edinburgh rock and shimmering spices; a hard-core Islay at this strength and a terrific offering of fruit peat smoke citrus sweetness and warming chocolate. Mouth saturating finish with juicy citrus and spices on the tongue. A rhapsody on peat."
334,10,"Scents of zested lemon caramel peanut brittle and crystalized pineapple with excelling smoke. What begins as a medley of toffee and caramel mingling with mandarin and lime soon shows plenty of bite: an eruption of peppercorn spices falls back to earth with flavors of hazelnut ripe banana and chocolate chip cookies. The finish dispenses dark toffees Brazil nut plain chocolate and a little spice."
335,9,"Aged in new French oak casks with long-toasted heads. Deliciously creamy sweet toasty profile with coconut cream toasted marshmallow toffee pudding and honeyed vanilla. Gentle spice notes (especially clove) and hints of fruit dance on the palate. Very soothing. (Bottled for Park Avenue Liquors.)"
336,10,"Not the pimply youth you might be mistakenly expecting this tongue-in-cheek release is impishly contemptuous of the regulations challenged by Glaser during the transparency debate. Lemon bonbon heavy vanilla scents beeswax boot polish and white chocolate are well integrated with peat. The exotic fruits and citrus zest tumbling with golden syrup are knocked sideways by clove and pepper. Water provokes more sweet smoke. A dry spicy waxy finish remains. (3282 bottles)"
337,10,"This 2016 release in its ceramic flagon entices you with lemon soft fruits honey digestive biscuits and taffy candy. It’s dense and weighty; oozing with flavors of barley sugar caramel sweet oak and some mature orange peel characteristics underpinned with ginger and pepper. Profoundly long sweet finish pricked with bitter orange and spice. One of those great drams that you can happily imbibe at cask strength without dilution. (2000 bottles)"
338,10,"The tastiest of their Signature range this boasts a dry oak and spice nose with fudge rye bread and banana interwoven with French oak influences of nutmeg cinnamon and ground ginger. As the gentle orange malt pear and apple settle down little spicy explosions of ginger and pepper detonate leaving an aftermath of spiced malt coffee cake milk chocolate and cocoa. Such a wonderful flavor trajectory to behold."
339,10,"Fresh morning blooms in the flower shop soft summer fruits of cantaloupe nectarine peach apricot scallop-shaped madeleines light vanilla and dry unobtrusive spices on this blend of sixteen single malt whiskies. Plunge into a pool of honey orange mango vanilla and sugary-sweet candy shot through with little darts of spice. The finish is relatively short with sweet pastries and light pepper but I think ewe will like this."
340,9,"A marriage of two casks of Caol Ila (25 and 29 years old) and one cask of Imperial (14 years old). Penetratingly smoky visceral rooty and even mean-tempered at times ultimately being soothed by creamy vanilla and thick malt. It’s peppered with licorice stick dark chocolate campfire charcoal subtle olive brine and teasing berried fruit. Long clinging finish. The flavors are nicely integrated and complex. Well done! (A limited release.)"
341,10,"The salty coastal twang meets the sherry head on revealing mandarin gingerbread glazed ham clove seashells and driftwood bonfires built on pebble beaches. Smoke comes to dominate the sherry. Orange oils precede a delayed ignition of the spices. More honeyed sweetness comes through while a smothering layer of peat rises up. Warm spicy finish until a thick curtain of smoke closes it down. But hey this rocks."
342,10,"There should be few qualms about snapping up this aged Highland gem given the blender’s prowess and the generous pricing. Ripe stone fruit straw sweet oak and ground almond on the nose. For its advancing years it’s quite a ride at full strength; thick glossy and mouth-coating with tangy sweet oranges fudge and candied citrus. Best sipped neat it ebbs away with bright orange fruit and buzzy spices. (1080 bottles) £200"
343,10,"Banana-flavored candy royal icing and cocoa powder with tangerine cantaloupe and soft pear on the nose. It’s lush groaning with fruit but still has plenty of body. Expect fresh fruity flavors of pear and apple strewn across a bed of honeyed sugary sweetness propped up by a big wedge of vanilla. Structured around whiskies of the now-closed Imperial Distillery it’s one to sip and savor as it weaves its magic spells. (5538 bottles 1800 for U.S.)"
344,10,"This is a peat-turbocharged version of Myths &Legends II. Mango papaya and burnt sugar meet soot ground ginger and aniseed: the bold tropical fruits are an equal match for the smoke. Beginning sharp and crisp with mango and tangerine this nimble blend lets smoke and more assertive spice notes elbow their way forward but they achieve consensus in the end. (4564 bottles)"
345,10,"Deftly blending the power and grace of popular Islay malts this whisky offers a sizzle of bacon fat thick clods of peat cocoa and breezy smoke on the nose. The rounded palate has sweet satsuma swathes of toasted spice sweeping malty notes delicious chocolate and burnt caramel. The wafting smoke builds formidably until it engulfs the back of the palate. Sheep Dip whisky may have been around since the 1970s but this latest creation maps out the best of modern Islay styles to great effect. A triumphant approachable blend that shows great strength of purpose yet remains full of charm. Number 13 in the 2017 Top 20"
346,10,"You looking for adventure my friend? Follow me. Enveloped in sweet aromatic smoke this wraps you in a headlock enabling smoke to snake into your nostrils and blow out both ears. Blistering smoky precision with shredded lemon peel île flottante toffee jasmine and cinnamon bark. A palate of lemon meringue pie vanilla light toffee and pepper conceals its true strength. For hedonists: Rowdy with a chance of peat for all. (278 bottles 90 for U.S.)—"
347,10,"A larger and mightier beast overall with menthol mint Life Savers raisins chocolate wafer bars and thick gray smoke lifting off smoldering peat. The experience is mouth drawing and full bodied at this strength with sweet orange milk chocolate clove and nutmeg the roof of the palate cloaked in a night sky of celestial peppery spices. Take it easy with water but use it to unshackle the soaring citrus notes. (1100 bottles for the U.S.)"
348,10,"Coconut macaroon baked sweet pastries peach purée sanded oak Starburst chews pear caramel shortbread strands of orange zest and crushed allspice and coriander seeds. Far from timorous this grown-up Highlander has the heart of a lion with flavors of cooked apple dark molasses vanilla pod lots of oak tannin pepper and coriander seed with a finish of dark sugars and peppery heat. Quite an animal. (828 bottles for the U.S.)"
349,4,"In my opinion Cutty Sark 25 year old is one of the great blends so a new version was always going to be a big ask. This one comes with a lot of packaging so is it a victory for style over substance? Not at all. This is all about big flavors; burnt orange juicy raisin and dark chocolate; rich oak and exotic spice. A treat and worthy of its heritage. But at that price—and bearing in mind it's a limited edition—are you going to open it?"
350,10,"Chocolate orange a sizzle of bacon fat and dry peat. While this feels less potent than Samaroli’s other Islay offerings it fits the mood perfectly for a nightcap. The taste buds detect orange honey chocolate praline hazelnut Oreos a hint of cocoa and an underbelly of peat smoke that carries into the finish. A wonderfully rich smooth digestif that will transport you back to Islay in your dreams."
351,10,"Built between Keith and Dufftown in 1898 but closed at the start of the 30s Towiemore’s warehouses were still in use until 1993. Fresh peaches and fragrant florals rich orange roasted almond chips and hazelnut. Glenrothes connoisseurs will appreciate this one. Mellow and nutty with a good supple texture; baked peach dried peel mango and light spices with a candied peel and spice finish."
352,10,"A limited edition cask strength blend of four single casks by Alasdair Day released to mark 100 years since the last entry in their blender’s historic cellar book. The nose has warm caramel whole orange and a dry grassy and gristy note. Rich orange envelops the mouth with golden caramel shortbread and underlying spices of ginger and pepper. Takes water well and retains its character; lots to like here."
353,10,"William Grant & Sons will be releasing a series of Ghosted Reserves in the years ahead drawing on their remaining stock from closed distilleries. Here Brian Kinsman has used whisky from Ladyburn and Inverleven to create a nose of zesty key lime pie peach butter mintoes and sweet oak. It is truly moreish with creamy malty flavors of sweet mandarin marzipan and strawberry with a chalky mouthfeel of candy sticks that lingers through the finish. Exceptionally good whisky. (6000 bottles)"
354,10,"This is a spicy prospect with pepper lemon bonbons and dense peat smoke though the toffee and sweet lemon are well-balanced against the smoke. Sweet lemon meringue pie candied peel and a twin assault of smoke and clove-led spices on the palate though the sweetness mounts a fight back. Great crescendo of flavor as Big Peat tries to show he is the perfect house guest for the holidays. (900 bottles for U.S.)"
1526,9,"A straightforward bourbon with no flaws. Nicely balanced flavors of fruit (mandarin apricot pineapple) gentle sweetness  (honey vanilla caramel) and soft spice (cinnamon mint). Gentle finish. Nice enough to drink straight in a pinch but it comes across as more of a mixing bourbon to me."
355,10,"Compared to Asyla this has noticeable added richness fruit and spice. The nose brings apple danish creamy custard honey citrus peel and the fragrance of lightly toasted spices. Against a core of rich tangy fruits a spicy partnership of pepper and clove manifests under the tongue stealthily curls around the sides and storms the palate. The mouth-coating finish drips with mandarin and cooked apple pierced by clove."
356,4,"Not Compass Box at the very top of its game but pretty damn good nevertheless. This is a mix of malts from different distilleries and it has the company's distinctive DNA all over it combining siege cannon-strength peated malt with rich fruity sherried whisky. It's clumsier than the wonderful Flaming Heart but in the same ballpark and I have to declare an interest — I adore this combination when it's delivered right. £180"
357,10,"A staple in the liquor cabinet this hearty malty dram conveys peppery smoke kippers dry spices pencil shavings a biscuit-like cereal note and more pungent peat smoke as the glass warms up. Among others this comprises Talisker Linkwood Cragganmore and Caol Ila malts. Fruit follows smoke with vanilla pastry desserts and peppercorn spices becoming creamier with shredded peel apple cobbler and a warming finish of orange peel and forward spices."
358,10,"Brace yourself. This takes peat to the extreme conjuring up a moist chocolate slab of peat being cut and lifted out of the bog. So smoky you will feel like you’re breathing in the dense clouds rising above the smoldering kilns. A punchy thwack of peat at full strength and even if you cut it with water it only highlights salty fishboxes and some buttery caramels cowering from the backdraft. A deliberately singular character but utterly brilliant nonetheless. £46"
359,10,"So good they didn’t name it twice. More brooding than the first iteration with a heavy curtain of ashy sooty smoke fresh herbal tones lemon and dried fruity sweetness. The palate is led by red cherry plum cranberry and tangy orange peel then hot smoke sets off a peppery firecracker. The structure is deceptively light developing more grip as the lemon sherbet sweetness heralds the lengthy finish of beach bonfire smoke. (8436 bottles)"
360,10,"Peach meringue whole apple runny honey vanilla eucalyptus and spices that are just about to burn in the pan. Lively and fresh Highland whisky flavor proffering sweet honey cooked apple dusted with icing sugar lime zest and a supportive lift of vibrant spices before diffusing into sugary squares of Scottish tablet. Water accentuates the peppermint in the finish and brings out sugary chocolate-mint flavors. One not to miss."
361,4,"Does it do exactly what it says on the tin? You betcha! This is big and it's smoky and if you're a fan of Islay malts then it's right up your street. There's more to it than just smoke though. There's stewed apple on the nose as well as steam engine oil and on the palate there's gooseberry spearmint and apple pip. But as you'd expect the peat lingers."
362,4,"So which independent bottler comes out in the 'Big' battle of the Islay blended malts? Given this is bottled at a lower strength and it's at a lower price I'm calling it a draw. The latest batch of this is the best yet with Ardbeg Caol Ila and Bowmore the main components although there is also some Port Ellen in the mix. So you know what to expect—and it doesn't disappoint. Big AND peaty."
363,10,"The first blended malt to carry the Chivas Regal name was created as a tribute to the legacy of the five master blenders from Charles Howard in 1895 to Colin Scott. Malts from five of Pernod Ricard’s Speyside distilleries (Strathisla Longmorn Tormore Allt-a-Bhainne and Braeval) were used to create intricate and elaborate flavors. Even more enchanting than the story are the aromas of fresh red apple cherry peach and mango mingled with cinnamon and dry heather. This luxurious whisky delivers dark vanilla soft fruits chocolate-dipped Brazil nuts and is cloaked in sumptuous layers of caramel wood spices and gingersnaps. Outstanding. Number 19 in the 2017 Top 20"
364,10,"Blended from 20 year old Strathisla Longmorn and Braeval whiskies to mark Manchester United’s treble—triple trophy win—in 1999 this is a drink of understated elegance. Orange peel toffee fine-roasted spices vanilla extract with hints of cocoa and malt on the nose. Creamy palate with Whoppers candied orange peel orange sherbet crystals and mild spices with a later phase of baked orange and butterscotch it remains creamy and soothing to the finish."
365,10,"The label of this distinctive blend of Highland and Speyside whiskies suggests it is designed for hotter and drier climates and it works well in a variety of serves. Peach slices pecan peanut cinnamon nutmeg grated milk chocolate baked cookies and toasted bakery aromas. It’s medium-bodied and eschews sweetness and fruitiness to inhabit a world of dark toffee Brazil nut dry oak malt plain chocolate hot peppery spice and licorice. (3000 bottles)"
366,10,"As if this cheeky devil from Douglas Laing wasn’t good enough already! Strawberry napoleon mint leaves rubbed between finger and thumb runny honey fresh peach and wood whittled on the back porch. The sweet orange starts gossamer light then it hits the gas: the citrus becomes more tangy touching blood orange fizzy sweeties become taffy candy then sherbet. Eventually pacified it becomes milky and sweet with milk chocolate melting on the tongue. A creamy finish like a mother’s embrace. £50"
367,10,"This is clever. Using Mossburn Cask Bill #2 the whisky has been finished in first-fill oloroso sherry butts with heavily toasted virgin American oak heads. The nose is intense: sweet barley fresh oak vanilla pear fresh apple orange peel and dry wood spices. Silky texture with citrus barley coriander seed pepper aniseed and clove offering further waves of creamy vanilla fruit Life Savers and soft malty notes."
368,4,"You have to take your hat off to Berry Bros. & Rudd’s Doug McIvor who is whisky's answer to Bruce Springsteen: consistently brilliant complex spanning the generations and in the form of his life. This just doesn't let up with plenty of smoke and peat in the mix but with citrus fruits some plummy depths and a vanilla cushion. It’s balanced perfectly. Born to run? You betcha."
369,10,"The smoking wicks of church candles smoked meat coastal notes cumin coriander seed and herbal elements. A sophisticated palate of unsweetened fruit. Peaches citrus and pineapple with a waxy presence building later on settles to a dry finish of herbs and beeswax. We can easily overlook the narcissism of making tributes to your own past bottlings as John Glaser turns whisky resurrectionist in homage to Eleuthera. Layered complex thought provoking and finely tuned for the connoisseur."
370,10,"Holy Moly! Where do they find them? Over 40 years old and this seizes your attention with a becoming nose of smoked ham sweet paprika and red currant jelly. It’s extremely fruity with just the right level of tartness to keep it in balance; pomegranate strawberry laces crystalized fruits and a nip of licorice adding to the richness and emerging creaminess before a dry finish of Victoria plums. Simply a gorgeous old grain. (300 bottles for UK Europe Scandinavia and Japan) £155"
371,10,"What happens when you light a bonfire underneath Green Label? Earthy peat smoke with medicinal characteristics of lanolin and antiseptic a salty tang balanced with creamy vanilla strands of citrus and touches of menthol and aniseed. Smooth as a thief in the night; mouth-coating toffee growing smoky notes and peppered mackerel push back the waxy citrus elements. Now the fire is alive; the sweetness gets out while it can. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
372,10,"One hundred ten years after the Nimrod expedition blender Richard Paterson’s adventurous marriage of over 20 Highland malts brings fresh green fruits manuka honey vanilla banana muffin cantaloupe fresh herbs spice and a wisp of smoke. Refreshing palate of green melon light honey vanilla cinnamon cooked apple and gooseberry becoming sour. More complexity on the finish: spice smoke cooked fruits and chalky Sweethearts candies. Pair with mature prosciutto."
373,10,"A blend of four single malts for the latest incarnation this has poached pear sweet green apple melon skins light spices barley sugar and yet some crunchy barley notes too. Sweet vanilla fattens out to orange peppercorn honey and barley sugar with apple and herbal greenery appearing at the end. Hold for at least 30 seconds then there’s spice at the swallow and a waxy mouth-coating finish of smooth-pulped fruits. (14894 bottles)"
374,10,"This is really intriguing with the vitality of fresh green shoots in spring fresh-mown lawns snow peas pencil shavings dragon fruit beet chips and the exotic scents of a spice market. The taste is gentle with lime herbal notes cream soda generous buttery caramel and some boisterous spices that loiter into the finish. A highly enjoyable bottle: one to dissect discuss and digest."
375,4,"It's not made clear which Islay malts are included in this blended malt but whoever's responsible for this has brought the big guns. This successfully pulls off an intense one-two with hard hitting Islay peat and brine on the one hand and some rich sweetness on the other making for a mouth-coatingly rich and intense whisky. The malts pack down together like a rugby scrum and combine with impressive intensity. €36"
376,10,"Runny caramel green melon and vanilla tagged with a few savory and spice notes though the smoke shows greater peat characteristics than the 21 year old. The tongue dips into honey fudge and caramel duels with mouth-drawing fruits such as raspberry redcurrant and cranberry then settles back under a gentle blanket of spice. A late flash of fresh mint departs with some spicy heat at the finish."
377,9,"Just as complex as Johnnie Walker Gold but fuller and more richly textured. (Not surprising given that there are no grain whiskies in Johnnie Walker Green.) This is one of the finer vatted malts on the market. Its flavors are well-integrated. You’ll find creamy toffee and nougat at its core which is then layered with notes of vanilla mint fresh brine and even a hint of mustard seed. Excitingly fresh and vibrant on the finish. A whisky for both the blend and single malt drinker. And at $55 it is also fairly valued for an all-malt whisky."
378,10,"This breezy coastal dram revels in aromas of lemon pine needle ozone clotted cream lavender rock pools and light peat smoke though there’s no smoking Tommy gun. A good-weight dram with bitter lemon royal icing vanilla and toffee plus assertive pepper oak char and burnt sugar that pummel away like a street fighter finally calming to an olive oil finish. This is a proper Islay whisky if you dare. (U.S. Exclusive; 2000 bottles)."
379,10,"Scallywag is no lapdog; this mutt runs off the leash and disappears down a rabbit hole. The first thing that strikes is a spicy blast of cardamom fennel and onion seeds. Baked chestnut grapefruit baked orange plum and walnut aromas. Warm marmalade with thick peel a fanfare of spices and brown sugar cubes. Gratifying finish of grapefruit peel and a burning core of spice deep in the throat."
380,4,"Pronounced “Pot Doo” this is without doubt a rugged coastal and/or island whisky but on a mild and temperate day. Salt spice and peat are all to the fore but it’s a gentle giant of a whisky with some citrus drizzle and a light honeycomb heart. The main wood influence seems to soften the delivery so that the punch it packs won’t floor you. Beautifully put together though."
381,10,"Roasted spices more peat than smoke coastal breezes lemon creaminess bacon-flavored chips and carbolic soap. Disarmingly it starts with lemon apple and honey before brilliantly the pepper and chili heat slams into you like an Acme grand piano falling from the sky. Bitter chocolate notes velvety cocoa and dry orange peel with morning-after cigar smoke settling ash and roasted meat juices. Seriously impressive delivery of flavor from Oliver Chilton who has concocted a versatile dram at a terrific value. £35"
382,10,"These Boutique-y blends are delivering terrifically good whiskies time after time but the small batches sell through quickly now that the word is out. This one has plums apple mixed peel spices walnut and sherry notes. The palate is fizzy with plummy depths chocolate shavings ginger biscuits and dark fruits with a medium-weight mouthfeel. This can go toe-to-toe with the best of ‘em. Once the ginger settles down it leaves a pleasing mild maltiness. Add water if you must. (370 bottles) £49"
383,10,"This is so much more than a pumped-up version of Peat Chimney; this has sweet smoke from singed green wood twigs light honey peach all balanced with TCP-soaked bandages. Nothing harsh or off-putting it’s just a delight. Sweet honey orange generous malt and caramel but it’s the smoke coiling its way throughout that makes the greatest impression on the palate and finish. These blended malts tend to move quickly so grab one while you can. Perfect for winter drinking. (12000 bottles) £42"
384,10,"Smoke and spice and all things nice. With Mossburn Cask Bill #1 the blenders created a finishing cask using first-fill bourbon staves with heads of heavily toasted virgin European oak. Baked citrus with some fresh grapefruit sharpness raw butternut squash and a cool line in salty smoke. The palate riffs off wine gums citrus savory smoke bitter roots pepper and clove leaving a long smoky finish."
385,10,"Finishing these malts in first-fill oloroso casks helps produce a tempting nose of tangy marmalade cherry chocolate sponge malt and apple tart with a rub of spice. Chocolate spiced orange pepper and ginger notes before sweet toffee breaks through allowing the orange peel-rich marmalade to mingle with the malt. It’s a big mouthful and definitely one to try."
386,10,"Like sniffing fine soil running through your fingers with creamy milk chocolate baked fruit mild spices and pungent acrid smoke that catches the back of the throat. Baked apple pear sultana and cocoa but then there’s the smoke: an inferno of caustic thick peat smoke and astringent pepper the dark recesses of the mouth beginning to blacken. It’s like throwing a punch in slow motion. Try it. (Total Wine exclusive)"
1563,12,"Pencil shavings Popsicle stick vanilla cinnamon toasted coconut and marshmallow on the nose. The palate is led by dry oak integrating orange cinnamon nuts iced tea and apple leading into a sweet finish. There are some interesting flavors here but the barrel seems to be overpowering them."
387,10,"If I had to back one of the protagonists in Douglas Laing’s latest Duel of the Phial my money would be squarely on the Ardbeg. The nose delights with oils oozing from the chestnut flesh of a grilled kipper coiled rope on a trawler’s deck and hot pressed asphalt with a gentle background note of roasted peanut and millionaire’s shortbread. Medium texture: lemon and butterscotch delicious fruitiness and spearmint on the mid-palate. Clean creamy with a baked lemon finish. £49"
388,4,"Cutty Sark master blender Kirsteen Campbell has hit the ground running and is playing a leading role in the revival of this iconic blend. Storm is a very different whisky than Tam o' Shanter. The nose is nuanced and light with orange jelly and citrus juice; the palate is sophisticated fruity perfectly balanced rounded and gentle with a high-percentage malt content evident in the mix. The finish is quite short but very more-ish. An amazing whisky for the price. £20 VALUE PICK"
389,4,"If big smoke and peat don't float your boat and you'd rather metaphorically skip through a summer orchard while drinking whisky then the Speyside version of Clan Denny is the full fruit bowl. The mixing of malts means that sherry and bourbon Speysiders get a say so it's the complete package and there's lots going on. Ultimately though it's not quite as focused as the Islay. Damn close call though.€36"
390,10,"Terrific nose of apple strudel vanilla fudge honey raisins in syrup and poached pears. A golden honeyed dram with fudge and a spike of ginger spice followed by apple muffins apple peelings a touch of oak char and a finish of sweet caramelized sugar. In case you are wondering Beldorney is Duncan Taylor’s term for Wardhead which is a blended malt of primarily Glenfiddich with a small amount of Balvenie."
391,10,"With Clynelish and Teaninich at its heart this expression spotlights Black Label’s rich fruit character with a nose of marmalade on well-done toast nectarine liquid honey candied peel dry spices and bourbon biscuits. Rounded orange notes with creamy vanilla and peppery spices; the spices are amplified with touches of oak char as the marmalade flavors die back. Sweet spicy creamy finish of orange fondant."
392,10,"The smoky black peat toasted spice lemon peel toffee swept autumn leaves and dried fruits on the nose give this expression greater affinity to regular Black Label than the rest of the range. Lagavulin and Caol Ila among other Islay single malts are included in this blend. The palate begins with a smooth array of caramel smoke and spice transitioning through darker toffee notes to thick treacle toasted hazelnut and peppercorn with brief flashes of fruitiness on the finish."
393,10,"Using Cardhu and Glendullan among other Speyside single malts to focus on Black Label’s orchard fruit attributes this has a nose of apple pie vanilla sponge cake caramel and aromatic pan-roasted spices. Sweet and spicy with a glossy mouthfeel it yields flavors of Fruit Pastilles vanilla cream sharp apple currants and baked sugar with a gentle undercurrent of spice. Ginger and pepper with jellied fruits and hints of citrus to finish."
394,9,"Bright gold color. Fresh aromas of smoked olives brine exotic pepper and fried bacon. Rich in body and slightly oily in texture. In flavor this is a big dynamic whisky-smoked olives sea salt seaweed mustard seed all on a backdrop of vanilla sweetness. Long smoky finish."
395,9,"Similar in profile to the 12 year old expression below except that the bouquet is thicker the sweetness is more caramelized and the fruit notes are drier (no surprises). There’s also more depth and maturity in this whisky more oak spice and a longer drier finish. An excellent value!"
396,1,"The Wemyss range — overseen by Susan Colville — has been quietly building a deserved reputation for being among the most consistently enjoyable single cask bottlings. This new example hails from the mighty Benrinnes distillery but shows a milder side to its make — there is indeed ginger aplenty along with cumin crystallized fruit and jellied peach but behind is a deep earthy and slightly leathery note typical of ‘The Ben.’ It’s these bass notes that dominate on the richly chewy palate. Best neat. £51"
397,10,"Gentle peat smoke mixed with smoldering wood shavings fresh maritime characteristics and milk chocolate but leave the glass a while and when you return the smoky intensity gets really pumped. Light melon flavors become engulfed by smoke then the pepper ginger and chili kick in leaving the soft fruit and vanilla cowering lamb-like in a corner. If you have peat smoke running in your veins you will love this."
398,10,"Nobody was expecting this Spanish proposition as the inquisitive John Glaser adds the first new permanent addition to the range in many years. Its chief weapons are Spanish red wine spiced orange cranberry redcurrant and ristras of dried red chili pods hanging in doorways. The ruthlessly efficient palate has red wine notes spicy chili heat and an almost fanatical devotion to the pepper. Pour a glass and fetch the cushions."
399,10,"This great value whisky encapsulates Speyside’s appealing regional character with notes of green apple airy florals vanilla fudge honey pecan nut toasted croissant marzipan and light dry spices. With its lovely structure and weight this unwraps apple golden syrup tart citrus banana and caramel. A smart aperitif choice for a carefree day this delivers a sweet light delicious dram with an active spicy finish. £32"
400,10,"Big Peat looks incredibly pale in the glass this year but his message is undiminished. Antiseptic pine-scented floor cleaner and an enveloping cloud of peat smoke with underlying peach and faint dabs of lemon. Sugary sweet with lemon lozenges light vanilla caramel and dark toffee while a bowling somersaulting smoky element gleefully turns cartwheels in the mouth. Hot dry finish like gargling with hot coals. Merry Peatmas everybody."
401,12,"Unlike the Jane Walker package for Johnnie Walker Black Label released in 2018 this is a new whisky altogether a blend of various malts aged at least 10 years including Cardhu and Clynelish. The nose is floral and gently nutty with rose water salted almonds green apple nougat and caramel chews. Light-bodied and silky in the mouth it has bright flavors of lime lemon vanilla and coconut before edging into nutty milk chocolate and finishing with good length and a final savory note. Best Value"
402,10,"The aromas comprise golden syrup toasted oats and hard toffee under muscular flavors of nduja and mint sauce on lamb cold cuts. Heavyset on the palate with abundant dried fruits honey butterscotch chile heat ginger and clove it opens up dense baked orange flavors ahead of a robust finish with citrus peel and ground ginger. If you relish meaty Speyside single malts like Benrinnes and Mortlach this one’s for you. (7741 bottles)"
403,10,"This is rich in cask characters with baked orange pronounced nutmeg notes mace peppercorn and petrichor. The opening flavors of dark orange and syrupy caramel swerve headlong into pepper root ginger allspice and nippy clove. Despite appearances this is not awash with sherry-dominated fruitiness but the finish is long with spice-led dried fruits. £32"
404,10,"Legendary master blender John Ramsay handpicked the casks for this whisky and the job was completed by his successor Gordon Motion. Puffy marshmallows nougat fallen orchard fruit green cardamom and clove; it’s like all the threads pull together harmoniously. A lucid concentration of fruit mingles on the tongue preceding flavor advancement through spearmint menthol light peat smoke and burning orange oils. Sit back as it heads toward a spicy tingle of ginger apple and scorched coriander seed. Deservedly famous. £2000"
405,4,"Somebody at Diageo has been taking a lot of interest in the Johnnie Walker range of late what with the revamp of the core range and now a regular stream of special releases. This is the first of a series for Travel Retail only but it takes the Johnnie Walker themes — vanilla spice and honey with wispy peat and smoke — and adds savory spice to the earthiness. But there are some very young notes in this."
406,10,"Well-balanced offering of sweet citrus grapefruit peel and beach bonfire smoke. Cream lemon and lime zest are overcome by smoke as the chili spice and pepper go off like a rocket. More disciplined it settles down to sweet orange lemon bonbon cocoa and driftwood smoke. An incredibly pale whisky it’s punchy but not overly complex although it does include some fun stickers to let you customize your own bottle. (3000 bottles)"
407,10,"The North of Scotland distillery (formerly Strathmore distillery) was a neighbor of Cambus and operated from 1957-1980 in Clackmannanshire. Bottlings are few and far between. This one is quite forward. Apple peelings baked apricot cinnamon nutmeg sherry notes with oak wood beef stock and adhesives. It tastes sweet vibrant and juicy with red berry fruits rosewater strawberry cream soda cherryade and cough linctus. A slightly bitter finish punctures the juiciness. (310 bottles for UK Europe Scandinavia and Japan) £165"
408,4,"Available only at the distillery or online and limited to 5000 special decanters this is a special Famous Grouse release to mark the 30th anniversary of the blend. Be careful though:  it's not a 30 year old blend. But it is excellent and there's lots of very old woody and ripe malt in the mix. As Highland Park and The Macallan are in the stable expect a fruity oaky superbly balanced treat.  £80"
409,10,"Lush soft summer fruits bathe the nose with green melon kiwi green apple tart gooseberry ladyfingers and a not unpleasant plastic note like toy building blocks or the glove compartment of a new car. Baked orange delivers sharp tart flavors with allspice barley sugar and hard candies later developing apple notes and settling into a creamy fruity finish."
410,10,"Windswept and coastal: rock pools the chalky sweetness of Edinburgh rock candy and aromas of smoked fish on the quayside. The masochism of bonfire smoke and peat reek is utterly invigorating and restorative. Lemon creaminess with an eruption of spice and citrus the irascible spices pushing out in all directions. This is a big cask strength bruiser but Peat’s choleric temper can be readily soothed with a drop of water. (1400 bottles for the U.S.)"
411,4,"The question with this sort of blended malt is whether the whole outperforms the sum of its parts. This is a big rich oily and peaty whisky suggesting both the Ledaig—the peated version of Tobermory and often a bland malt—and the Bowmore—capable of big smoke notes when it wants to—are firing on all cylinders. There's not much subtlety to it but it's enjoyable all the same.€40"
412,10,"This strikes an earnest tone with a nose of rich fruit dried apricot whole orange macadamia nut ground spices and pepper crackers. A blend of 21 malts and the first blended malt in Royal Salute’s 66-year history this has a harmonious palate comprising citrus apple pear barley sugar and ginger spice with a finish focused on orange and a little spice."
413,10,"One of four new affordable blended malts in the range this delivers a direct line of clean pure smoke; richly peaty with shrimp shells salty sea spray fresh citrus peel vanilla and the aroma of fine cigar smoke. There’s an elegant purity to the nose. The palate takes a different course with tangy sharp citrus bitter orange herbal notes lemon sherbet shortbread and jagged spices. Quite a stallion. £32"
414,10,"Treacle tarts black bun and polished antique furniture with fainter accents of dark chocolate espresso and delicate smoke flowing freely from the glass. Densely structured palate. Initially chocolate-coated coffee beans then it blossoms into dried fig date with a developing deep tangy chocolate orange note fading to dusty cocoa like the memory of a warm embrace. Not to be confused with Cutty Sark this Storm is bottled by the Whisky Shack Company."
415,10,"A dense suffocating fog of peat smoke sea salt dry seaweed on the high tide and lemon-scented candles. Remember to come up for air once in a while. A supple silky texture of lemon mousse baked apple vanilla cinnamon ginger and a massive rush of pepper. Hold this in your mouth for as long as possible; the flavor delivery is impressively long and constantly evolving. Hot drying finish and frankly a relief from the peppery assault on the palate. £47"
416,10,"A smart little 8 year old blended malt with notes of light vanilla hay bales fresh flowers and orange-flavored candies. Light clean and easy to like. The palate majors in orange flavors first orange juice with crunchy biscuit gingerbread and fizzy sherbet in the middle. It’s packed with flavor and depth and ends with orange lollipops. The tanginess ricochets around the mouth leaving a deep glow of citrus."
417,10,"Rich fruit spiced orange fudge fragrant spices and sweet playful smoke make for a splendid nosing experience. The piscine flavors however may best suit smokeheads as along with fudge and vanilla this has a splendid flavor of oily smoky kippers. Golden syrup green apple and black pepper emerge but the smoked-fish flavors spill into the finish to swim with pepper and fruity sweetness."
418,10,"The final cornerstone of Douglas Laing’s Remarkable Regional Malts range this blended malt celebrates the best from the Islands. The peat smoke finds harmony with the nose of pine lemon curd dewy lawns and vanilla fudge. This is gloriously full-flavored; the peatiness certainly delivers but there is a pleasant nip of saltiness too. The black pepper finish leads to a long lasting salty smack on the lips. Make this your hipflask essential for bracing excursions along the shoreline. £38"
419,10,"And you shall be scotched: vanilla fudge eraser-tipped pencils spoonfuls of thick lemon curd rhubarb compote root ginger and cumin. This malty dram has a decent weight behind it with rich caramel chocolate-flavored toffee deep notes of orange and zested limes plum fruit and well-balanced peppery spices. A little spice dusty chocolate and Horlicks on the finish. A solid whisky so just holler if you want some. (1200 bottles)"
420,10,"Peat smoke dominates the nose of salt crystals green tea pine cones peppermint creams and charcoal. The tasty palate has sweet fudge heather honey and mandarin which balance out the ginger and light pepper spiciness. Smoke catches in the throat as it becomes fruitier in the later stages. Finish is hot drying with smoke and ginger spices. Decent enough though its appeal will skew toward peat lovers."
421,10,"Never more than an arm’s length away from most bartenders this blended malt launched in 2005 has been a game changer. Bottled at a higher strength this has fresh green apples buttercream lime and kumquat with a fresh acidic tartness butterscotch crushed peppercorn and dried chili flakes. Dark toffee Brazil nut chocolate peppery spices and toasted oak on the palate. Lively finish of spice and chocolate toffee. Best Value"
422,10,"The new Wemyss Family Collection includes two blended malts; this is the better of the pair. Raisin date fruitcake stewed apple and plum cumin coriander allspice and new leather leave little mystery about the role played by the sherry hogshead. Gingerbread plum and dark orange draw the mouth. Fruity sweetness but never sugary; there are jam tarts walnut and minimal interference from the spices until the dry finish. (6300 bottles) £47"
423,6,"Distilled in 1986 this single cask from Blair Athol distillery in Perthshire yielded 268 bottles and the nose offers sweet fruits principally apple and orange plus walnuts vanilla and brittle toffee. Becoming softer and creamier with time. Dark fruit notes on the palate notably blackcurrants and cranberries with caramel and cinnamon. The finish is quite viscous with a little oak freshly-squeezed lemons and licorice twists. £85"
424,9,"A marriage of two whiskies: 30% 18 year old Caol Ila finished in Chateau d’Yquem Sauternes casks and 70% 10 year old Bowmore finished in Grenache wine casks. A honeyed sultana sweetness (from the d’Yquem?) nicely tames the rooty smoke iodine seaweed brine pepper and subtle Spanish olive. Bramble and berried fruit (from the Grenache?) add another layer and dimension. A very dynamic whisky worthy of exploring and debating how well all these flavors integrate with each other."
425,10,"A terrific value blend of Macallan Glenrothes and Tamdhu matured in sherry casks has produced one of the darkest whiskies on the market. Inescapable aromas of thick Seville orange marmalade polished saddle leather too-hot-to-hold sweet chestnuts pulled from a brazier dry fruitcake 100% cacao and Medjool dates. Sweet prunes chocolate ganache cola tannins and singed wood spices combine to produce a formidable proposition. Heavily sherried and oaky for sure; this has been bottled not a day too early. (337 bottles Royal Mile Whiskies only) £200"
426,10,"Rich marmalade gingersnaps dried tropical fruits vanilla pods and cinnamon bark abound on this limited edition top dog whisky from Douglas Laing & Co which includes Mortlach Macallan and Glenrothes. The satsuma peel acidity settles quickly to show off its tricks of green apple spices hazelnut Maltesers and ginger. Late development brings out plain chocolate squares maltiness and intense coffee notes. Water picks out chocolate orange truffles. Coffee cups and chocolate biscuits to finish. My tail is wagging for more. (4800 bottles) £50"
427,10,"This is a sophisticated and finessed take on Islay blended malt which must be Kilchoman-free given the age statement. Driftwood waxy lemons soft buttery fudge banana milkshake dry grasses and the gentlest puff of smoke promise calm seas ahead. A silken dram anointing the palate with lemon meringue pie honey and caramel. This becomes creamier with faint tendrils of smoke and dancing spices through to the finish. Utterly charming and tremendous value for the money. (419 bottles) £82"
428,10,"Malt and seaweed drying around rock pools this builds up a good head of dry fibrous peat smoke with sautéed mushrooms chocolate nibs and ozone. Sweet lemons and sugar mice on the palate it slides into a creamy-smooth pool of milk chocolate the smoke kicking in later on dragging a layer of clove and pepper in its wake. Proof that an Islay experience need not break the bank."
429,10,"Lombard’s blend of Speyside malts pleases with an agreeable nose of orchard blossoms flower honey caramel dry hay and pears baked in brown granulated sugar. It’s homey and comforting favoring its floral and fruity side. This is a light sweet whisky that sweeps around the mouth radiating maltiness apple grapefruit dried mango strips and mingling spices. A studiously long finish of sucked caramel candy and beeswax follows. A smart choice for the beginning of the evening. £30"
430,10,"Another classic label introduces its blended malt alter ego: this is much fruitier than Scottish Leader on first impression with apple pear lime zest apricot tart sherry notes and a trace of spice. Apple pie filling with clove and ginger spices plus vanilla dark toffee hard candies citrus and nougat peak early then ride the crest of a wave until a gingersnap and spice finish. (Travel Retail) £30"
431,10,"A confectioner’s delight; Fry’s Five Centres lime lemon kumquat iced buns fresh mint and crushed cardamom that matches the chocolate aromas. Those re-charred rejuvenated casks are very much in evidence here. It has a gilded satiny sheen glistening with lemon drizzle cake butterscotch orange matchsticks and banana bread. Incontrovertibly it inhabits a signature grain style but it fizzles out with a sticky sweet aftertaste like licking the spoon from the icing bowl. £45"
432,10,"Appearances can be deceptive as this pallid specimen proves. Overripe honeydew melons lemon cheesecake sprinkled with zest vanilla pear muffins cooked apple spring blossoms and icing sugar. The sweet sugary opener is burnt out enjoyably by blistering burnt orange butterscotch and lemon bonbons. While the flavor intensity builds commendably it doesn’t escape without a touch of astringency. Water makes this sing ‘Oranges and Lemons’ but go easy with it. The finish is like a greedy mouthful of tarte au citron. £80"
433,10,"The power of pure burning peat smoke lemon-scented floor polish pine needles salt spray and delicate vanilla places this squarely among the archetypal whiskies from Islay. Sweet lemon custard cream biscuits and hints of smoked goose lend an oily mouthfeel. A combustible climax of smoke spice and earthy peat kindle a red-hot finish that will have you puffing smoke like a chimney."
434,10,"This was inspired by Stewart Laing’s childhood journeys by steam locomotive from Glasgow to Speyside with his father. Hunter Laing’s blended malt includes contributions from Blair Athol Teaninich and Clynelish and raises toffee sauce dried banana chips and spring foliage with a fringe of fresh mint. You can appreciate the cool clean taste; ripe banana and chocolate-dipped fudge blooming into late notes of mocha ginger and chocolate mousse. Dry finish of ginger cookies and espresso. All aboard! £40"
435,10,"This torchbearer for the Compass Box Scotch Whisky Transparency campaign is looking for your support. A fruit medley of lemon lime gooseberry cream and soft pineapple chunks. Ripe apple and pear from the orchard are given a fresh spicy lift and integrate with the vanilla and sweet toffee notes. It makes a clean exit with lengthy spices and juiciness never becoming bitter. One thing is clear it’s a finely structured dram worthy of your vote. (5922 bottles)"
1147,8,"A somewhat tight nose with cocoa spiced oak brown sugar and saddle leather; water reveals vivid vanilla and a bit of banana. The initial honeyed sweetness and chocolate-covered peanut cluster flavors quickly get brushed aside by the tannic oak and searing spice. Drinks a bit hot and hurried—with Szechuan pepper heat before a jolt of citrus oil. (18000 bottles)"
436,10,"Encompassing more than just Islay malts the youngest liquid in this is from 1995. Malt loaf peat barns heavy salty smoke hazelnut latte roasted fennel seed star anise and sooty embers. This one could set the smoke alarms off. Good weight in the mouth with pears in chocolate clove aniseed vegetal notes and deceptively less smoke until the powerfully intense finish of spice soft fruit cocoa and seemingly eternal smoke."
437,10,"The stills ran cold in this lost Islay distillery at Ballygrant in the 1860s. Excitingly acrid smoke on the nose: like fireworks or the smoking muzzle of a rifle mingled with summer lemons and crunchy green pear. Poached pears in cream greengages and peppercorns meet a stealthy sour gooseberry takeover. Fades to a chalky sour fruit plateau before a chili heat finish."
438,9,"Lovely balance on the nose and palate. Soft and gently textured too. The sweetness of the whisky (honey fruit gum drops and malty vanilla) dovetail nicely with light bright citrus and teasing dried spices. Heather/floral notes enhance the whisky’s complexity. Clean delicately polished oak finish. A very versatile inexpensive easy-drinking whisky."
439,7,"With some powerhouse whiskies in the blend (including an '87 Bunnahabhain) it’s a surprise that the nose is so reserved with citrus ginger and honey. On the palate you need your flavor shovel to unearth a core of typically strong flavors including leather oak salt dark chocolate and even rancio. It’s delicious but highly elusive. The finish is medium and quite dry. What an odd blend. I haven’t had to work this hard for a blend in a long time. (U.S. only)"
440,10,"This wee sleekit cow’rin tim’rous beastie is a blended malt of Highland whiskies from Douglas Laing the latest of their regional recipes to join Scallywag and Big Peat. Perfumed soaps in muslin bags dried sprigs of heather beeswax and Edinburgh rock give this an intriguing bouquet. Juicy: mandarins glow with green plums and Granny Smith apples. Ripe yellow fruits and spices mid-palate conclude with sweet malt and fading creaminess sweeping around the gums. Distinctive and laudable. £39"
441,10,"Soft and floral with perfumed lavender soap peach green apple and parma violets. It floats in the mouth dispensing flavors of sweet apple custard tangy tangerine hard candies green plum marshmallow and white pepper. Delicious and accomplished but there’s an overlap here: it feels like the NAS version had a birthday rather than the arrival of a new member of the family. £35"
442,6,"The latest batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts includes Vanilla Summer. It is an unspecified Highland single malt distilled in 1997 and the bourbon cask in which it was matured has yielded 263 bottles. Vanilla buttercups and violets on the nose developing Bramley apples with peaches and cream. Background of mildly spicy malt. Sweet and floral on the palate with tropical fruits fudge and ginger. Slowly drying with benevolent oak but ultimately a lingering creaminess. £50 (Not available in the U.S.)"
443,10,"Rosey Mitchell of Three Sheets cocktail bar in London and winner of the Compass Box bartender competition collaborated on this whisky with Compass Box whisky maker Jill Boyd. Apple strudel well-toasted malted bread red apple and hints of peat smoke: this pushes in lots of different directions. Light fudge a well of active spices orange and peppercorn with smoked citrus peel on the dry finish. Convoluted and discombobulating. (6151 bottles)"
444,10,"A delicious and inviting proposition this offers heather honey on toast marmalade dark vanilla and flapjack aromas. Soft on the palate there are gingersnaps dipped in thick-cut marmalade and runny caramels though the ginger flavor muscles its way to the fore eventually. Water promotes more candied peel before a spearmint conclusion. This is really enjoyable whisky for those lucky enough to get their hands on it. (30 bottles) £50"
445,10,"Named after the warehouseman’s preferred piece of pilfering paraphernalia the 125 year old Craigellachie Hotel’s Copper Dog bar now boasts its own whisky. It’s an appealing blend of eight Speyside malts with honey warm toast pecan nut apple turnover fudge fingers and orange peel. Vanilla orange pith wood spice caramel and fresh apple develop into creamy nougat. Takes a while to come into focus then concludes with a spicy finish."
446,9,"For the past few years Famous Grouse vintage vatted malt has been produced but not sold here in the U.S. They were in the 10-12 year old age range. This version being introduced to the U.S. is a non-vintage expression and I don’t think it really matters. What matters is its taste. Major components of The Famous Grouse blended whiskies have included The Macallan and Highland Park and there’s no doubt these malts are providing some of the richness and flavor complexity in this new expression. The whisky is quite hefty with notes of juicy fruit toffee almonds heather and a wisp of vanilla and smoke. It is also very well balanced and quite a bargain for $30."
447,10,"With the majority of the blend coming from older single malts this forms a counterpoint to I and II (see below). Toasted spices fennel black peppercorns cocoa malt loaf split orange peels and salted caramel invade the nose. The palate is a gluttony of chocolate. Beneath look for dried fruits macchiato peanut shells and some tannic bitterness as the older malts show their wares. It leaves a cocoa finish without the sweetness. A great concept for self-educating your palate. £106"
448,10,"Having previously appeared in 8 and 12 year old versions Wemyss dropped the age statement from their easygoing honey-drenched dram. Fortunately the nose of light honey lavender heather and spring blossoms confirms that it’s business as usual. Melon mango passion fruit and a deft touch of spice give this a sweet fruity profile. Gentle heat persists into the finish with honeyed sweetness. It’s crying out for a perfect scoop of vanilla ice cream. Still a crowd pleaser. £37"
449,9,"Consists of two whiskies: half 10 year old Clynelish (finished in Chateau Lafite casks) and half 10 year old Ben Nevis (finished in Grenache Blanc casks). The classic chewy nutty toffee notes of Ben Nevis are prominent throughout while Clynelish’s spicy briny notes become more prominent mid-palate peaking on the finish. The two work well together with the brine and spice cutting through the thick toffee. Bright berried fruit (from the finishing) adds an additional dimension prominently throughout. Some oak resin kicks in on the finish to keep the whisky from becoming too sappy sweet."
450,6,"This “double malt” contains 70% 12 year old Dufftown (finished in a Zinfandel cask) and 30% 15 year old Mortlach (finished in a Callejo cask). This is a rich fruity gripping broad-shouldered Speyside whisky. Richly sherried with thick layered sweetness as a foundation (honey caramel light toffee) along with ripe bramble golden raisin and pit fruit. Leather tobacco-tinged oak tannin finish."
501,10,"The nose has honey caramelized apples Pixy Stix pears in cream faint pepper ground coriander and salty driftwood. It’s teeth-coating with golden syrup sugariness the silky texture meting out pears apples sweet barley notes and crunchy spices before a vanilla phase gives way to black pepper licorice and smoke. Mouth-numbing finish of long-active spices over vanilla. (7908 bottles)"
451,10,"The black-labeled Carbon relates to heavily charred casks which bring aromas of toffee raisin chocolate dark concentrated fruits barbecued meat and ashy soot. The smokiness broods malevolently if you leave the glass. The texture feels too light to shoulder the flavors of dark char toffee spice and dark fruity chocolate as the balance becomes swamped in smoke. It’s like a young child wearing their father’s thickest winter overcoat. (Global Travel Retail only)"
452,10,"This North British has been led astray; well subjected to three months’ confinement in first-fill oloroso sherry wood. Such are the ways of Darkness! There’s a savory nose of peppered filet mustard seed and tarragon. Interesting but not to everyone’s taste. The creamy texture consists of evaporated milk strong caramel dark toffee and black currant granola though that savory character persists. Water pumps up the cream raspberry and cereal notes until it sees daylight becoming almost a breakfast whisky. £70"
453,4,"Wemyss has picked up where The Easy Drinking Whisky Company left off a few years back and are selling their mix of malt whiskies under a descriptive flavor name. This is the best the company has done so far. It is a delightfully soft fruity and dessert-like whisky with yes lashings of honeyed malt to make it a soft succulent treat of a whisky. Wemyss comes of age.  £36"
454,4,"Have you ever noticed how some distilleries never appear under independent labels? They say they put a teaspoon of whisky from another distillery in each barrel; no longer a single malt. Whether they really do who knows? So here is a blended malt with 99.99 percent of the whisky from one distillery. This has no peat and is sweet honeyed and rich with vanilla banana lime sherbet and tropical fruits. Almost certainly from Speyside…but where? £50"
455,10,"Benachie formerly known as Jericho was an Aberdeenshire distillery built southeast of Huntly that existed from 1822–1913. A dark amber dram with a nose of marmalade ground almond cherry lips and vanilla essence. Attractive but not overly aromatic. Cooked plums after a peppery rush begin an attenuated flavor journey exiting with a spicy finale."
456,10,"Who could refuse a blend of single malts wholly matured in oloroso sherry casks? They’ve perfectly bottled the aroma of molten tiffin: the chocolate cocoa biscuit raisin dried dates and walnut are all here. Sipping brings on chocolate coffee malt ginger nutmeg and dried fig. There’s no slow reveal it pretty much lays its cards on the table immediately; rather than developing flavors they extinguish one by one leaving a finish of cocoa and maltiness. (6000 bottles) £40"
457,4,"The old name for Edinburgh has been hijacked for use on this mix of Islay malts and appropriate it is. The creosote damp outbuilding and oily rope nose is distinctive and strong the peat pronounced in the taste though gooseberry green melon and a trace of kumquat are also in the mix and there's pepper in there too. But ultimately the peat holds out and brings up the finish."
458,10,"The nose is pleasant with fresh strawberry spicy smoke cookie dough allspice and glacé cherry but the palate fails to shine or excite. This has been finished in port and Pedro Ximénez casks giving the whisky a subtle rose hue but it needs more body. There are flavors of biscuit mandarin vanilla and redcurrant. It meanders along with a fairly flat trajectory then hits the buffers with some lingering rosehip fruitiness. (2266 bottles for U.S.)"
459,10,"Custard creams lemon peel and clotted cream create easygoing aromas on this drop from the mighty Edinburgh grain distillery. The palate moves rapidly through flavors of lemon cake and lime zest to grapefruit sharpness and fresh pineapple reaching a plateau of sherbet and tangerine. Like a bulldog chewing a wasp there’s lip-puckering sharpness throughout though it’s judiciously dosed with sufficient sweetness to counterbalance it. A great introduction to the delights of the single grain category. (117 bottles) £48"
460,4,"We don't see very much Craigellachie as a single malt because most of it goes into blending and from that we might draw the conclusion that it's not particularly distinctive in its own right. If it plays a role in this mix it's a submissive one then because after a not altogether enticing nose that has gooseberry green salad and some prickly chili pepper the palate is all about a mouth-coating big pepper hit that stays long into the finish. €40"
461,9,"Pleasingly aromatic and floral with lively fruit fresh cereal grain honey and vanilla cream. Subtle grassy hay notes add complexity. A very friendly whisky conjuring up images of a sunny afternoon in Spring."
462,10,"This NAS version is a little smokier than before with ground pepper toasted coriander and fennel seeds and a dusting of nutmeg. The mouthfeel is light initially; early orange and lime flavors are extinguished quickly. Warm cocoa malt chocolate shavings black cherry raspberry bubblegum and concentrated dark fruits complement restrained spices and faint smoke followed by a hot spicy cinnamon finish. It’s pretty decent but the palate doesn’t quite match up to the promise of the nose. £37"
463,10,"Playing on regional styles this blends six single malts representative of the Speyside Islay Lowland Campbeltown Islands and Highland whisky regions. Sun-dried peats greet the nose with aromas of stewed apples flaky pastries apricot conserve vanilla and cinnamon. Creamy vanilla and coconut flavors develop with a slow-burn spiciness crackling in the center of the tongue. Seville orange and caramel cookie flavors escort a long finish of dry tingling spices though it could use a little more heft in the mouthfeel."
464,4,"This is one of the more intriguing of the Double Barrel series because while the others either complement each other or don’t
this has a depth to it that you need to look for. At first it’s all Laphroaig and the peat and sea burst out of the glass. But just as you’re asking yourself what the point is the fruity notes of the Mortlach cushion the whole landing and let you down gently. Impressive. £48"
465,1,"A tribute this time from Edrington Group in the form of this one-off blend of The Famous Grouse. The sherried element seems to have been upped as it shows lavish amounts of dark chocolate black cherry and a little treacle with some orange peel and with water raspberry and heather.  The palate shows a hint of smoke and builds through rich flavors to a toffee-accented finish. Subtle and long. £25"
466,9,"A marriage of Ben Nevis (85%) and Clynelish (15%). A weighty whisky. Not as nimble as the Speyside expression below but with flavors that linger. Rummy toffee notes roasted nuts earthy moss jammy fruit teasingly subtle black strap molasses and clove."
467,10,"Rose petals pomegranate toasted coriander seeds and glacé cherry mix it up with a tangle of Bramley apple peelings. A medium weight grain whisky with a satiny texture. Huge throbbing pulsating ginger kicks in at full strength. Yowser! Water knocks the fiery ginger out but quells this Loch Lomond to a duller spice profile. A finish of ground almond subdued gingerbread and active spices. Great nose but I was hoping for greater versatility of flavor. £38"
468,10,"This laudable effort of comparative whiskies explores the effect of age by combining four parcels of stock in different proportions. The older whiskies produce an enticing nose of marmalade-encrusted ham on the bone grist and worn sandpaper. It’s sugary sweet with ripe melon before the sherry takes control and dishes out cherry candy and papaya. Held in the mouth it develops layers of creamy latte and milk chocolate as the fruit fades. More to get your teeth into here. £54"
469,7,"Whiskies from undisclosed Speyside and Highland distilleries are blended together in first-fill sherry butts. On the nose it’s an alluring blend of orange cherry toffee salt and ginger. The entry follows the nose with toffee orange ginger and malt. Things begin to drop off in the mid-palate which is very focused on salt and ginger with strong alcohol undertones. The alcohol drives and defines a dry finish that's absent of much of what's so alluring about this whisky. (U.S. only)"
470,9,"An equal marriage of Longmorn and Glen Moray whiskies. Quite a fruity adventure with zingy notes of bramble strawberry rhubarb sultana nectarine and plum. All this fruit sits on a bed of creamy vanilla malt (the Longmorn influence is quite evident) that coats the palate long after the finish."
471,9,"Consists of 60% Bowmore and 40% Caol Ila. Bold youthful and somewhat medicinal (as would be expected) with peat smoke tar pebbles on a beach and boat docks. Additional flavors of smoked olives and exotic pepper add intrigue while honeyed malt notes soothe the palate and provide balance."
472,4,"The problem with selling your whisky by description is that if you don't deliver what you've claimed in the name you're in trouble. That's a little bit how it was with these whiskies when they were seven years old. At this age though these are big boy whiskies and there is plenty of peat seaweed oil barbecued fish and salty sea notes to keep you hooked. Nicely balanced with fruit too.  £35"
473,9,"Aggressive earthy smoke tar fiery pepper bath soap and ginger tamed by toffee and ripe malt. Lingering smoldering peat anise and tobacco. For those who like smoky whiskies young aggressive and unabashed."
474,9,"Nectarine tangerine toffee and vanilla on the nose. There’s also teasing smoke if you look for it. The sweet fruity notes start at the beginning of the palate then cinnamon nutmeg cut hay and smoke kick in. Lingering cracked pepper clove and distant smoke. Good gritty texture. Dynamic stuff for a young whisky."
475,10,"William Grant & Sons Rare Cask Reserves are micro-blends created jointly by Brian Kinsman and various liquor store proprietors drawing on a choice of over 40 different single malts (importantly not Glenfiddich or Balvenie). Quite herbal with tarragon cilantro boiled candies and unripe plums. A slow starter; vegetal notes yield to fudge milk chocolate orange and maltiness with pepper oak and spices in the latter phases. Stocked in only five U.S. retailers."
476,1,"Aultmore is part of the Dewar’s stable and another of Speyside’s forgotten light brigade. Here is a noseful of esters: bubblegum pineapple pink grapefruit strawberries and icing sugar. Visions of “Legally Blonde” flash through the mind. The palate is equally energetic though with little cask influence it’s a bit gawky and slightly green especially with water suggesting that another year wouldn’t have done it any harm. Still all very lovely.  £100"
477,9,"A blend of four different Islay malt whiskies. A pungent merciless Islay whisky with intense peat reek tarry rope and raw seaweed. Fiery cinnamon clove evergreen and unsweetened black licorice stick just adds fuel to the fire. An underbelly of vanilla malt and suggestions of coconut cream try to douse the fire but it's a losing battle. Long seemingly endless burning ember finish."
478,9,"Remarkably light and drinkable for an all-malt product. Malty foundation with citrus (lemon zest tangerine sherbet) shining through along with vanilla wafer white chocolate coconut ginger and cut grass. A worthy “bridge whisky” for blended whisky drinkers curious about malt whisky but single malt whisky drinkers might want more individuality. A whisky for a warm lazy afternoon."
479,10,"Despite the high strength the aromas strike the nose like a pillow in slow motion. Greengages corn and ripening lemons lift from the glass. It’s a thick unctuous layered mouthful with honey gooseberry and lemon acidity though a splash of water produces softer notes of Scottish tablet and evaporated milk. A little sourness in the finish. Sure part of the allure of Boutique-y whisky is the batch variations but this is quite a different beast from the magnificent Batch 1. £72"
480,4,"The least assertive of the Wemyss 12 year old range and the most flighty. There's nothing wrong here and the whisky's well-made and won't disappoint but when you compare the spice hit here with what's on offer with other malts this isn't shouting loudly enough. £35"
481,4,"The weakest of the Double Barrel trio on offer this has a slightly spirity nose with a somewhat unpleasant off note but the taste promises more than the nose delivers. The oily peaty Caol Ila is seemingly held in check by the Tamdhu on the one hand while the fresh zingy sherbet-like characteristics of Tamdhu are tantalizingly faint. In the end pepper and peat dominate.€40"
482,10,"This is the Lowland entry into Douglas Laing’s Remarkable Regional Malts collection and on approach the nose is like sipping lemonade in a malt hopper: gristy malt lemon lime honeydew melon vanilla pods peach and apricot. A similarly juicy palate gaining sweet grassy notes Spangles and confectioners’ sugar before ending on a finish of dried citrus and fizzy Refreshers. True to the region but the Epicurean makes the rest of the range look brighter quicker smarter and tastier in comparison. £34"
483,9,"Indeed smooth and malty with vanilla shortbread golden raisin and macadamia nuts. Light oak spice emerges on a fairly quick finish. (It is only 8 years old after all.) Pleasant and easy-going."
484,10,"Caramel wafers white pepper pumice stone and strands of caramel on the nose but this is not a whisky bursting with personality. A sip brings cocoa and chocolate flavors which meld into an herb garden bouquet. A thin mouthfeel and rather linear flavor development make this seem rather ordinary not a word I normally associate with this idiosyncratic range. The finish is redolent of marble cake. Not a patch on the superb Batch 1 in my book. (415 bottles) £100"
485,10,"A predominantly young blended malt heads up the first of the Reference Series designed as an educational tool to help attune your palate. It’s a light floral array with waxed lemons oatcakes and peppermint. Mouthfeel is thin with little structure heavy on the barley with hints of boiled fruit candies. Sipped neat it’s drying with doughy notes and dried apple. Water fails to enliven the experience other than showing late lemon and icing sugar. Memorize it and move up. £37"
3612,9,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Shimmering gold Aroma: Very complex with a potpourri of spicy herbal notes. There’s a lot going on here. Nice depth too. Palate: Similar to its aroma nicely balanced and evolving. Lingering spicy finish."
486,10,"Magnificently powerful and intense. Caramels dried peats elegant cigar smoke seeds scraped from vanilla beans brand new pencils peppercorn coriander seeds and star anise make for a deeply satisfying nosing experience. Silky caramels bountiful fruits of ripe peach stewed apple orange pith and pervasive smoke with elements of burnt tobacco. An abiding finish of smoke dry spices and banoffee pie sweetness. Close to perfection. Editor's Choice"
487,7,"As you’d expect solid peat is the first thing out of the glass but this isn’t just a peat beast. Underneath are honey dried fruit and malt. The palate is all about balance with honeyed malt raisin and oak spice all complementing smoky peat. A lush mouthfeel makes you forget it’s cask strength. A pure love note in a glass from Compass Box to Park Avenue Liquor.  (Park Avenue Liquor only)"
488,10,"Would you have gambled The Last Drop 1960 liquid in new sherry wood for four more years? The indulgent nose proffers maple syrup buckwheat honey roasted spices blue grapes pomegranate raspberry compote cilantro pandan leaf and beefsteak juices soaking into mushroom gills. The complex lustrous mouthfeel is replete with a sheen of rich maltiness molasses lashed by sherry before a dry resinous finish. Water brings an oily nuttiness then further drops produce a silky clingy texture. Glorious. Miraculous. Victorious. (388 bottles only)"
489,9,"An essay in balance on both the aroma and palate. Silky layers of delicate sweetness (honeyed vanilla caramel light toffee) permeate through clean delicate fruit (citrus peach currant) and subtle complex dried spice. Clean finish with a hint of dark chocolate. A very versatile very drinkable blend which suits most moods and occasions. Indeed a benchmark blended scotch."
490,10,"Drawn from stocks aged at least 28 years this magnificent blend begins with aromas of burning heather toffee nuts cigar smoke leather raisins broken orange pekoe tea leaves fruit loaf black licorice allspice and cinnamon. Truly classic Johnnie Walker with smooth warming flavors of orange brown sugar barley sugar and gentle harmonious spice followed by dark toffee vanilla pod candied peel sultana prune juice malt and cocoa."
491,9,"Formulated to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Johnnie Walker. This is a fabulous whisky for anyone who can spring for the bottle. It is deep dark and quite powerful with a hefty malt foundation and sweeter notes of toffee and vanilla combined with resinous oak complex fruit (both bright citrus notes and darker pit fruits) crisp mint tobacco polished leather and heavy peat smoke. A tour de force of a blended scotch-as big as many single malts reviewed here."
492,10,"Fresh spring floral bouquets white peach and nectarine tumble with sweet caramel dried cherry white chocolate fresh linen notes and vanilla cake batter. Silky smooth with fresh summer fruits the strong peppery spices push to the fore but this is nimble graceful and displays a real lightness. Compelling captivating blending for the Flask Collection by Sandy Hyslop this has a fragrance you could enjoy all night."
493,9,"A 12 year old blended whisky was created in 1972 consisting of 70 different malt whiskies and 12 grain whiskies.  The blend was then placed in three sherry casks where it was matured for the next 36 years (highly irregular to say the least).  The quality of the sherry casks is quite evident as is the whisky's age.  There's substantial malt content here too.  These three factors along with the wide range of malt and grain whiskies combine to create one of the finest blended Scotch whiskies I have ever tasted.  It's dark mysterious and enormously complex with notes of molasses fig cake dried fruit tobacco dark chocolate old pot still rum and polished leather finishing with lingering cinnamon and mint.  There's no sign of this whisky getting tired at all.  I am pleased they bottled it at natural strength and didn't water it down to 40% or 43% abv which could have ruined it.
(Allocation information:  There's a total of 1.347 bottles of which only 350 are being imported to the U.S.  They are available exclusively at Binny's Beverage Depot (Chicago) Park Avenue Liquors (New York) and Wally's (Los Angeles))."
494,10,"A spectacular citrus nose with incredible freshness; neroli oil bergamot orange an array of wood spices baked apricot dried strawberry heather lavender honeysuckle jasmine and hyacinth. An intense array of citrus on the palate—the strongest being mandarin it is thick-textured yet agile—accompanied by baked brioche Ling heather honey vanilla and oak with a hint of eucalyptus on the extraordinarily long finish. A masterclass in rare whisky blending."
495,10,"Highland toffee dried banana salted caramel seashells flipped from rock pools and crispy-skinned oily fish barbecuing over a fire. Sweet toffee meets cinnamon pepper and clove as an express train of smoke clatters through leaving intense citrus peel oils and green fruits in the backwash. A spasm of spice marks the finish: arid amid baked fruits and toffee. Leave me now I have everything I need."
496,10,"This uninhibited tempestuous expression of Blue Label highlights the artistry of the blender through the judicious use of closed distillery malts and grains. Coastal notes of sea spray lemon dirty peat smoke cookies and cream After Eight mints caramel and dry-roasted spice aromas. Combining lemon bonbon waxy orange cookie dough fondant icing and chocolate with tobacco smoke hints of peppermint and grapefruit notes this flagrantly outclasses the Brora variant."
497,4,"You don't mess with the Johnnie Walker brand name casually so we expect greatness and boy do we get it here. This has a dusty smoky nose with dried apricot and grape and the whisky is gossamer-soft on the palate with sweet pear and honey evolving on top of an oaky rich heart before a tidal wave of pepper and peat and a delightful spice smoke and oak conclusion. Magnificent."
498,10,"The pinnacle of the current Johnnie Walker range this is a rare inimitable blend of just nine whiskies. It exudes the aromas of ripe bananitos whole mango satsuma vanilla seeds barley awns butter biscuits and crystallized pineapple. The supple grain sustains indulgent characterful malts creating a weighty smooth mouthfeel. I’m smitten by the vanilla creaminess burgeoning deep fruit layers how it swells with a satisfying snuffbox smokiness. A beautifully styled blend delivering a captivating sensuous experience. (330 bottles only)"
499,10,"A blend of eight whiskies including Oban Brora Cambus and Lagavulin producing a sweet yet complex dram that may surprise regular Blue Label drinkers. The nose has peach marmalade brown sugar sprinkled on caramel fine pepper soft peatiness oiled wood and campfire smokiness. The sugary palate yields toffee apple fudge vanilla dried fruit peach and gentle spice then fiery smoke pepper cocoa milky coffee and chocolate. Legendary indeed."
500,10,"Named after the gun rounds fired on Royal anniversaries at the Tower of London. Heightened sherry tones with dark Madagascar chocolate Brazil nut fondant cream and faint espresso indulge the nose. One heavenly sip reveals a velvety smooth whisky thick and sticky all revolving around the chocolate and nut with a little support from dark fruits. You can chew over this for hours as the finish soft-pedals the main themes. A work of genius."
503,10,"Master blender Stephanie Macleod’s innovative blend was inspired by Dewar’s famous double aging process. She separately blended parcels of aged malt and grain whisky left each to marry then blended them together to marry again before finishing in oloroso sherry casks. A tantalizing nose of chocolate caramel vanilla crystalized orange slice fresh plum black cherry and moist coffee grounds. Smooth flavors of chocolate-dipped raspberries gingersnaps and bold sherry fruit yield to a finish of smoke and spice. By releasing in novel half-bottles Dewar’s spreads the love enabling us to experience a 21 year old scotch for just 50 bucks. Number 2 in the 2019 Top 20"
504,10,"An auld alliance renewed this gorgeous whisky packs spicy aromas of peppercorn star anise and cardamom seeds mingling with toffee squares plum jam dunnage earth and dried sprigs of heather. Rich fruitcake jellied fruit and bramble then spices course through the mouth: chili heat black pepper and raw ginger. Final phase has chocolate praline growing milky nutty and soothing. Exceptional lengthy finish with reignited spices. Chivas 18 goes electric. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
505,9,"Well what have we here? A blend of 50% malt and 50% grain (a very high malt content for a blend) and bottled at 50% too! The whisky was blended first (very unusual) before being aged in sherry casks for its entire life. Antique amber/chestnut color. Full sherry impact but never cloying -- the higher alcohol level and grain whisky cut through the sherry and add balance and drinkability. This is a fruity-confection delight with raisin chutney fig cake orange almond scone and chocolate-covered cherry. Add to the mix richly textured toffee old oak polished leather and a cinnamon-spiced tobacco finish. A rare treat! A great old blend that malt drinkers will embrace."
506,10,"If a Scotch whisky could smell plush and velvety this Pedro Ximénez-finished blend would be it. Chocolate-covered raisins peat smoke cigar lounge licorice chamois leather and charred oak staves. The palate is smooth delicate and finely tuned with syrupy prune raisins plum raspberry strawberry 70% dark chocolate peppercorn ginger clove and a hint of smoke. This showcases lip-smacking intricate blending on the oldest Dewar’s available. Editors' Choice"
507,10,"Jaw-dropping: Aberlour 1973 Bunnahabhain 1968 and 1969 Bowmore 1968 Caperdonich 1972 Glen Grant 1974 Glenfarclas 1966 Glenlivet 1968 and 1970 Highland Park 1967 and 1970 and Macallan 1969. It includes a 14% grain content from Caledonian 1974 Carsebridge 1970 Girvan 1974 Invergordon 1972 Lochside 1966 North of Scotland 1974 and Port Dundas 1973. An elegant refined mélange of peach pear soft oak and rose cream florals with dark fruit chocolate and fine pepper. Outstanding."
508,9,"Well-structured and masculine with its rich malty backbone and mouth-coating fruit. Yet there’s a silky seductive underbelly that’s very compelling. Notes of sultana honey-drenched mandarin ripe peach thick toffee and anise with a peppering of spice throughout especially toward the finish where a hint of smoke emerges. The grain whisky enhances the blend’s allure by cutting through the whisky’s viscosity making it very more-ish. I love the combination of drinkability flavor complexity and balance in this blend. Very versatile. Single malt drinkers will thoroughly enjoy this experience. (Note: at this time this whisky is not sold in the U.S.)"
509,10,"A blast of exotic spices followed by sweet oak juicy tangerines bosc pear sandalwood petitgrain oil and vanilla seeds; it’s that junction of oak and spices where the mizunara has worked its magic. The palate is medium in weight with caramel hazelnut and a collision of orange and active spices with the mizunara continuing to influence the flavor of the finish. The cooperage may be arduous but it’s worth it. (Global Travel Retail)"
510,10,"It’s like someone just turned up the volume on flavor. Cherry fudge marshmallow vanilla pod ristretto luscious caramel almond-topped Dundee cake and wood spices. Dark oily and muscular with burnished orange clove licorice and burnt char. Sweetness brims over the tongue with apple pear
and malted barley as it softens to a beautiful velvety texture. This whisky’s great journey
is over. The baked apricot instigates an eternal finish (1352 bottles 300 for the U.S.)"
511,10,"This presents a mellow bouquet of rich dried fruits peat smoke baked sugar on puff pastry and almond butter cups. The chocolate-orange signature note ebbs and flows mingling with spices and clove nuts dried apricot caramel vanilla and baked apple ending with a frisson of spice and mild smoke. Understated elegance: this whisky is polished smooth as glass."
512,9,"The last new Chivas release was the 25 year old several years back. To be honest I didn’t like it as much as Chivas 18 year old. Those extra years contributed an additional dry oak influence which I felt was a bit too dominant—especially on the finish. So you can imagine my concerns before tasting this 38 year old whisky. But this new Royal Salute has something to balance the dry oak that the 25 year old didn’t—lush rich sweet sherry notes. It’s quite fruity with toffee apple date nut cake fig molasses and golden raisin up front evolving to dried fruit pencil shavings tobacco and polished leather with subtle cinnamon and cocoa on the finish. My favorite of the entire Chivas line is the 18 year old (which I rated a 95) for its impeccable balance but this is still a very impressive whisky!"
513,10,"TLD’s sixth release captivates with dark caramel Brazil nut polished oak cacao scorched earth grilled field mushroom and roasted coffee bean aromas. To sip is to submit to a discombobulating whirl of cherry and jellied black fruits replete with old sherry characteristics replaced by an unctuous oily base torn asunder by seething spices of clove pepper and star anise. Ever-changing. Muted exit of dulled spice browning apple and eucalyptus. (898 bottles)"
514,10,"Honey vanilla poached pears in cream driftwood bonfires and a sprinkle of wood spices comprise a clean focused and well-balanced nose. A golden and silky palate of sweet honey vanilla white chocolate and lemon zest with plenty of body. Enter caramel; the smoke cuts to the front outstripping aromatic spices orchard fruit and baked citrus flavors. Compelling and moreish: drink whenever it’s raining in Glasgow and you can’t go wrong."
515,9,"Black Bottle is unique in that it combines seven different Islay whiskies with grain whisky. This produces a whisky with a beautifully rounded Islay character that will satisfy the discriminating “peat-head” the drinkability of a blended scotch and plenty of complexity. For a blend there’s heft to the whisky. I enjoy the interplay between the peat smoke brine seaweed its firm malty foundation and pleasingly dry finish."
516,10,"Here’s your private audience with the inestimable Mr. Beveridge. After contemplating impeccably selected aged liquids from the big five Distillers Company Limited (DCL) grain distilleries he’s ready. Three vattings representing cask character distillery character and Highland single malt were combined in the final blend. Fresh layers of lemon and honey mingle with wood smoke. A seductive soft and creamy palate saturated with fudge and delicate vanilla fuse together in a study of honeyed perfection. A fine indulgence. The best yet. (8888 bottles)"
517,1,"Bright gold. Amazingly fresh fruits and quince slowly evolving into mango blueberry and a jammy tayberry note. At the same time exotic spices like cardamom begin to build particularly when the surface is broken with a drop of water while vanilla pod notes develop. In the mouth the grain smooths all the elements giving an unctuous feel. There’s just sufficient oakiness to give structure and any smoke is far in the distance.  A triumph of the blender’s art. £100000"
518,10,"Perhaps the most alluring name ever given to a whisky this has a nose of bright zesty potent clementine with vanilla sponge cake fudge heady floral scents toasted coriander seeds and peppercorn. Citrus drives the palate but it’s sweet and tangy and arrives with vanilla fudge toffee and twinkling little flights of spice. Brilliant blending and the tastiest exploration of Ballantine’s signature notes to date. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
519,10,"Not seen since 2010 this yields vanilla frosting menthol spearmint cream dry spices cedarwood chopped herbs and a discernable whiff of old grain. Silky taste of butterscotch; it becomes more honeyed with creamy vanilla dried banana malt and a pinch of cinnamon pepper herbs clove and eucalyptus. The yin and yang of Glen Elgin and Girvan makes an admirable exercise in precision minimalist blending. Mad as a box of frogs."
520,10,"This release from independent bottler The Last Drop has a captivating aroma of dark toffee cinnamon Brazil nut star anise polished oak vanilla seed crème de cassis and a wisp of smoke that shows more charred stave as time goes on. Peach and baked orange precede an early peak of spice and smoke then sit back and swim in the soothing mélange of chocolate brownie Whoppers stewed apple vanilla pod oak sultana and plum jam. (732 bottles) Collectibles"
521,10,"This second release in the Flask Collection epitomizes deft management of PX finishing to produce an opulent treat. Honey and sherry notes chunks of fruit-and-nut chocolate melting caramel plummy fruit chocolate-covered raisins refined dry spices and stimulating peppercorn notes as the whisky warms. Thick and luxurious texture with vanilla caramel Seville orange plum pudding crème caramel crystallized citrus and melted chocolate with a lightly spicy sweet caramel finish."
522,10,"Aged for a quarter century and finished in Royal Brackla casks? Count me in. The nose is highly attractive; a rich maltiness unfolds with vanilla oak flapjacks whole almonds and gentle background spices. Smooth caramels chocolate orange and a cappuccino note create a thick weighty blend that melts gracefully into pools of darker chocolate. The mouth-coating finish has plain chocolate dry oak and coffee. Brilliant liquid: smoothness personified."
523,10,"An exceptional blend from first-fill American oak casks which has Glenburgie
whisky at its heart. Dry oak Rolos cantaloupe dried mango strips papaya and
cinnamon on the nose. Rewarding and weighty with caramel orange raspberry
layers of spice and dark toffee with a concentrated fruitiness and a smear of spices
leading to a warm dark lengthy finish. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
524,10,"It rarely gets better than this. Vanilla almond slice toffee pencil shavings sweet oak and mild wood spices on the nose. Effortlessly smooth and delicate this warms up gradually with malt dark fudge leather raisin and tobacco notes before the wood spices oak and chocolate take center stage ending with a warm lengthy finish. This must be master blender Colin Scott’s most preciously guarded recipe. The man’s a genius!"
525,10,"Marmalade almond and cinnamon buns this is a grand interpretation of rich and dry fruit with an extra layer of lush fruit from the cognac cask. It is thoroughly integrated and the cognac is respectful of the scotch. The palate is luxurious with rich dark fruits and toffee velvety smooth with the cognac fruit encircling the blend and wood spice on the finish. The perfect dram for frosty winter nights."
526,4,"Rarely has a blend caused as much excitement as this one but with good reason. This is also known as the Shackleton whisky and is a recreation of the whisky abandoned in the Antarctic by explorer Ernest Shackleton more than 100 years ago. It has lemon spring blossom and wafts of smoke on the nose. The taste is full and citrusy with peat and pepper in attendance. Beautifully balanced and outstanding but there are just 50000 bottles so snap it up."
527,4,"The original Great King Street blend was all sweet lemon and spice. This is something else again. This is a gutsy urban wise guy of a whisky rich in peat with distinctive malty flavors—all in all closer to a malt than a blend. That's because of the high malt content and only the rounded edges and soft finish are gilded by grain. Some fruit and spice emerge through the peat but the smoke's what you remember—a master class in blending."
528,8,"A very pretty and delicate whiskey that becomes more beguiling with each sniff. Following the initial peanut vanilla and caramel notes it slowly reveals incense dried pineapple and stone fruits sprinkled with spice. The palate is generously sweet with peach tea and soft wood tannins lending lovely texture before a finish of zesty citrus tobacco leaf and exotic spice. Finished for two years in new charred mizunara oak."
529,10,"The end of a series this fifth and rarest edition has worked leather chocolate dark toffee cinnamon bark toasted currants charcoal and smoking incense. The smoke is commanding but never domineering. It’s a contemplative and weighty proposition dark as midnight with plain chocolate spices and dark berries with a smoky intensity following through on the finish. (3888 bottles) Collectible"
530,10,"This limited edition released for the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines is bourbon cask-finished after following Dewar’s customary double-aging process. It tees off with manuka honey toasted English muffin vanilla seed toasted coconut and baking spice aromas. It goes down the hole smoothly with creamy flavors around a core of vanilla intensity plus cream soda dried banana and green fruits gliding through honey butterscotch sauce and caramel."
531,10,"Bales of aged tobacco damp autumnal leaves aromatic backyard bonfire smoke barrel staves soaked in aged sherry dried fig prune flesh milk chocolate and polished antique wood grab the attention of the olfactory system. Deep wells of concentrated dark fruits give this a studied intensity with chocolate-hazelnut ganache date plum and a dry finish reminiscent of barrel char and oak tannins. Majestic one might say. (525 bottles)"
532,10,"Closer to the heart of JW than its predecessors Mastery of Oak follows a methodically complicated maturation and blending regime. American oak characteristics singed cedar spills damson jam stewed apple and rhubarb laced with peppery spice nutmeg and clove. A dichotomy of flavors: toffee apple and rhubarb become piquant verging on sour with a parallel strand of honey and Caramac. Short finish of the last vestiges of fruit and spice. (5588 bottles U.S. Travel Retail)"
1237,9,"Quite dark in color turning cloudy with water. Don’t let that deter you. A thick chewy bourbon with layers of nutty toffee
nougat cocoa and toasted marshmallow peppered with cinnamon and vanilla. Oak and leather on the finish dry out the whiskey nicely. Not the most refined bourbon but the flavors it delivers make up for it."
533,10,"Nuts sinking into molten toffee wrapped in pure sensuous smoke on a foundation of cedarwood dried fruits and seasoned oak: as exotic as the box’s interior artwork. Sandy Hyslop’s multi-phasic blend draws on closed distillery Imperial’s trademark fruitiness and peated Caperdonich while maintaining a steady hand on the balance. Toffee sweetness mixed peel pepper nutmeg citrus and smoke. Creamy satisfying finish with hints of melted chocolate and light smoke. (Travel Retail)"
534,10,"This spicy concoction inspired by John Walker’s original Old Highland Whisky has a nose of marzipan candied peel raisin marmalade aromatic spices pepper and ginger loaf with a trace of cool smoke and peppermint. The strength and pepperiness give this plenty of clout with a flavor unique among Johnnie Walker whiskies: brown sugar hazelnut royal icing on wedding cake nuts pepper clove peat and blackened fruitcake."
535,9,"Johnnie Walker Blue meet Dewar’s Signature. Signature is Dewar’s introduction into the ultra-premium blended scotch category. Like Johnnie Walker Blue Signature bears no age statement but I’m told that a 27 year old Aberfeldy is the heart of the blend. The first release consists only of 1000 individually numbered bottles and they’re only available in New York City. I’m always a little skeptical of very expensive blends that come in fancy packages. There are some very good reasonably priced blends in the 10-20 year old range and the expensive ones are often only marginally better if that. But I like this whisky a whole lot better than the standard Dewar’s White Label and it is also superior to Dewar’s 12 year old-a whisky which I find to be quite enjoyable. While maintaining the Dewar’s profile-nicely balanced-this whisky offers greater depth maturity and complexity without being too woody-a creamy malty foundation makes sure of that. The whisky expresses a rich honeyed maltiness which combines nicely with notes of golden raisins vanilla caramel and crème brûlée with just a hint of spicy oak notes for complexity. Signature is a different style when compared to Johnnie Walker Blue-it’s more elegant and bashful-but like Blue I put Signature on my short list of the finest blends on the market."
536,9,"A whopping 90% malt and 10% grain whisky. Soft with the oak remarkably restrained for its age. Soothingly sweet with toffee apple vanilla-spiked sponge cake nougat butterscotch sultana and cut grass. A dash of cinnamon and coconut throughout with teasing gentle polished oak on the finish. Deftly balanced and oh so drinkable."
537,10,"This surrealist Compass Box whisky mimics the dimensional challenges of Magritte’s “Ceci n’est pas une pipe” by raising questions about the luxury pretensions of whisky. Is it the expense? Packaging? Good taste? Masquerading behind a green apple a bowler-hatted John Glaser smiles enigmatically. Sultanas charcoal smoke toffee chocolate sea salt and warm sherry tones. The alcohol rides with dense black cherry cacao nibs Colombian coffee and dark fruits. Trails of smoking fruitcake finish the experience. Above all buy and consume. (4992 bottles)"
538,10,"Peatheads listen up! Yes there’s pine needles zested lemons honey sanded wood nutmeg and cinnamon within this Islay-dominated blend but it’s the billowing peat smoke that makes this special. It reeks gloriously of stacked fish boxes and heavy braided ropes on the pier. The dark fruit baked lemons cherry clove and cooked plum face entanglement in a labyrinth of shadowy stygian smoke. You could get lost in here for hours. (15000 bottles)"
539,10,"Bladnoch master distiller Ian MacMillan’s blend is worth seeking out for its appealing freshness; green apple caramel shaved oak toasted whole-grain bread warm pastries and dried peels. The palate is awash with bright flavors of honey walnut barley sugar gingerbread in custard orange taffy candy and a little spice. It squeezes out more juicy peel oils the more you taste. The conclusion has sweet honey gingerbread crumbs and a citrus intensity."
540,10,"Like opening a box of chocolates and hungrily inhaling the aromas of fruity chocolate caramel and soft centers. In addition there are crystalized orange slices fresh plum black cherry moist coffee grounds and petrichor. Flavors of chocolate-dipped raspberries gingersnaps and bold sherry fruit from the oloroso finish. It’s a dance between the smoke and the fruit with the smoke ultimately pushed to the fringes leaving a spiced mocha finish."
541,10,"Mango candied orange peel coriander seed creamy vanilla and exotic spices on the nose of this aged blend finished in sweet rum barrels from Trinidad Jamaica and Nicaragua. A bright and sunny whisky it’s full-bodied and moreish led by tropical fruit flavors of dried papaya mango melon honey butterscotch and zesty orange all framed by gentle spices. Sweet drams are made of this who am I to disagree?"
542,10,"Sandy Hyslop has excelled at solely blending European oak sherry cask whiskies here. A dry spicy nose to relish: rum-raisin ice cream wafer biscuits fennel seeds roasted coriander seasoned oak and dense fruitcake. After the Cinnamon Toast Crunch and toffee sweetness disrobe a riot of spices cavorts across the tastebuds bedding down to a flavor of spiced chocolate-covered toffee bars. For cigar lovers this demands a fine robust smoke. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
543,10,"And you thought all Chivas Regal 18 year old was the same. Luscious toffee cinnamon nutmeg chocolate praline dry grasses hazelnut and just a lift of lime and peppermint. The palate has fudge-like sweetness caramel walnut cake murmuring spices orange peel and toffee banana. Water unlocks watermelon and a fruitier side to its character. The spices push hard through the finish as the toffee flavors relinquish their grip."
544,10,"Try this in your next Manhattan. Heather honey sweetness Belgian waffles cinnamon rye spices creamy vanilla peppercorn and dried porcini emerge after the 6-month rye cask finishing period. Sweet caramel oozes over the tongue Highland toffee and Orkney fudge hold the spices in check. Banana candy and deep citrus acknowledge the Dufftown single malt component. The most accomplished Blender’s Batch to date. Emma Walker has nailed it. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
545,10,"With its nose of honey green apple lemon and fragrant spices this kicks off Compass Box’s 20th anniversary celebration. Blended by lead whisky maker James Saxon it has an unctuous luxurious texture malty and sweet with dark toffee gingersnaps cinnamon lemon zest dried tropical fruits and vanilla cream. The gentle spices ebb and flow finishing on a last hurrah of dark cookies and vanilla. (2400 bottles for U.S.) Collectible"
546,10,"Ringmaster John Glaser’s latest Big Top attraction: the nose juggles dark marmalade almonds sweet sherry dates and dried pineapple. Flavors swing like a trapeze between deep orange dried tropical fruits nuts and chocolate with the silky composure of a seal balancing a ball on its nose. Ridiculously smooth; if you’re looking for burn try fire eating instead. Knife throwers accurately pinpoint the finish: fruit (thud) chocolate (thud) spice (THUD). In this manner Mr. G. will challenge the world! (2490 bottles)"
5515,9,"Fragrant aromas of ripe barley and vanilla with some background pear hay dusty cocoa ginger and lemon grass. Similar follow through on the palate with a creamy mouthcoating texture throughout and a drying finish. Nice anytime."
547,10,"A purity and fragility rarely encountered with aromas as fleeting as footprints on wet sand: marshmallow meringue honey and rose petals. A delicacy to the structure brings banana caramel spun sugar and orange peel. The oak spices build slowly making the lips throb from the inside. It’s an elaborate maze of ethereal suggestion and an apparition of calm beauty. It atrophies reluctantly leaving tangy peels and lengthy sweetness anchored by spicy base notes. (12000 bottles)"
548,10,"Smoke begins Jim Beveridge’s public replication of the annual Directors Blend concept built around Johnnie Walker’s signature characteristics. Peat smoke harks back to Islay but there’s wood smoke tobacco leaf and malt with a salty richness behind it. The grain just gives it a lift of extra sweetness. Polished with great structure; red apple raspberry and sweet linctus wrap up with a long smoky finish of cigar stub and peat stores. Clear parallels with Directors Blend 2009 but better. (8888 decanters released) £500"
549,10,"Complex elegant textures from the get-go; woodsmoke from a bonfire of green twigs ashy peat embers grain stores vanilla cream and honey drizzled over baked apples. Golden syrup flapjacks vanilla fudge candied apricot orange peel Quaker oats gingerbread pepper and a catch of smoke that bridges into the finish where hints of citrus and golden honeyed grains are found. Classical allure but eminently accessible."
550,10,"Inhale deeply and this bestows a sense of serenity; morning dew on clipped lawns strewn with spent fireworks and strands of honey mingled with subtle elegant smoke. Blender Maureen Robinson’s light well-balanced creation ushers in gentle honey and growing sweetness before billowing puffs of smoke grow dominant. Charred peaks of a lemon meringue pie iced coffee and milk chocolate follow leaving a catch of smoke in the aftertaste. Quite a charmer."
551,10,"This archetypal midnight dram enthralls with aromas of cedar wood humidor blossom honey hazelnut vanilla pod treacle cake and maple syrup. Dry as leaves save for some floaty florals. It’s less weighty than some whiskies at this age with a balanced show of cinnamon cocoa berry fruits dried grapefruit hard peel wood spices dark toffee and oak. A finish of dark vanilla oak spice and leather make for a fine digestif. (782 bottles)"
552,10,"A pedigree blend gracing your glass with aromas of sultana prune glacé cherry toffee nutmeg dense dark fruits sweet toffee and cozy Christmas spices. This well-paced silky blend canters through red apple cherry pomegranate pressed date bars Brazil nut nutmeg and pepper. Cinnamon black pepper and apple peel make for a harmonious finish. A suitably glamorous libation for spectators of the sport of kings. £110"
553,10,"This pale gold limited-edition dram is named in honor of House Stark from the Song of Ice and Fire book series better known by its television name Game of Thrones. Designed for Highballs or pouring over ice it offers a nose of vanilla sponge cake sweetness dried grasses green melon spring blossoms white pepper and a faint trace of peppermint. It has a soft caressing character with melon pulpy summer fruits sour lemon butterscotch barley sugar vanilla caramel and a later supportive fizzle of spice. It concludes with a finish of sweet vanilla and fruits."
554,10,"The nose is strikingly different than what is typical of Chivas Regal; aside from tequila there are a lot of floral notes perfumed soaps Jaffa orange and a little pepper. Pear and tequila notes on the palate reverberate around a central hub of spice before sweetness breaks through surfing a wave of orange grapefruit juice and fresh green apple. A very smooth drink; this is sweet spicy and invigorating."
555,10,"Nostalgic aromas of wafers white chocolate hints of spice and vanilla ice cream make this a mouthwatering choice. Sweet and creamy there are rich flavors of vanilla panna cotta candied fruit pear apricot and white chocolate adding caramel custard creams and sliced banana toward the end. Inspired by great blenders from many generations ago this is astonishingly good for pleasurable drinking and mixing."
556,4,"After a series of esoteric and expensive releases Compass Box has decided to bring it all back to the people with a blend — and how! The journey sets out as we might expect; all sweet vanilla ice cream stewed pear tart and peach melba but then a wave of spice and white pepper provides an unexpected but delightful twist. It’s like Spice Tree meets Hedonism…Spiconism if you like."
557,10,"This dark chestnut liquid exudes wafts of rose hip dense fruitcake sliced fig cherry oak Brazil nut and earthy fragrant damp moss within the rich sherry complexity. A voluptuous palate-saturating whisky with burnt orange ginger spices star anise dried fig and ripe purple plums concluding with chocolate truffles. It’s a rollicking good blend dripping with sherry notes and leaves a deep glow far back in the palate. You’re going to love it. (1428 bottles) £120"
558,10,"The Dewar’s 8 year old line is developing into one of the best series in contemporary blending. This noses of vanilla sponge cake roasted spices exotic woods lemongrass stalks walnuts and spun sugar nests. Vanilla honey yellow apple lemongrass and some understated herbal notes; the smoothness is noteworthy and its glossy mouth-coating finish is studded with spices. (Editors' Choice)"
559,10,"This is much more muscular than the regular un-haunted Blue Label. It delivers a multitude of flavors—butter toffee sweet smoke citrus peel and dry spices—tantalizingly peeling off layer after layer building a slow crescendo to a peak of spices and bitter citrus. Mouth drawing with caramel apple pear and sherbet a mid-palate of zesty orange and baking spices before topping out with bitter peels grapefruit smoke and sour hard candy."
560,10,"As you raise the glass to your nose this has refreshment written all over it. The fragrance of an early morning visit to a florist zesty orange notes honey peach pits a hint of salt and the faintest trace of smoke. It’s silky smooth glistening with honey a firm edge of orange vanilla tablet barley sugar powdered ginger all elevated by the grains supporting the Scapa. A smooth feather-light finish of sparkling light spices and creaminess. A joy to behold."
561,10,"Originally blended then recasked into fresh bourbon wood three decades ago the nose of ripened peaches cooked pear pecan nuts menthol clove and vanilla make for a compelling combination. A surprising lift of red summer fruits as this bright whisky sashays around the mouth the complexity measured out in installments; plum sauce toasted oak coffee bean gingersnaps clove licorice and hints of savory juices. It dances on and on with the whirling wood spices in no hurry whatsoever. (592 bottles)"
562,10,"Rather luxurious aromas of orange peel walnut stewed fruits fleshy plum peach pit sherry fruit gentle oak and wood spices. Spiced marmalade dark Seville orange plum vanilla and plump raisin; this lays down a rich blanket of flavor though it’s slit open by a piercing blade of spice. I like the subtlety of the sherry influence and the mouth-coating finish of orange peel ginger and spice."
563,10,"Bottled in recognition of Sir Alex Ferguson’s remarkable thirteen league soccer titles this scotch does him proud. Juicy citrus aromatic spices and vanilla pudding; the nose is enveloped with milk chocolate aromas and further spiciness. The blend was selectively finished in American rye barrels and the flavors crescendo through orange malt chocolate mint and pepper with some rye spices that usher in a lengthy spicy finish. Blissfully good. Best Value"
564,10,"Sweet caramel on the boundary of maple syrup flavors with aging tobacco leaf walnuts malted barley charcoal sticks and snuffed candle wicks all cushioned by soft oak. An initial impression of a lighter character though it’s bursting with juicy toffee butterscotch sauce wood spices and dried banana. The spices vibrate gently around the gums on the dry finish of this high-malt content blend leaving nutty residual flavors."
565,13,"The nose displays a great mix of spice and nuttiness with toasted almonds cocktail peanuts and Honey Bunches of Oats. A splash of water opens it up with dark fruit—cooked cherries and blackberry jam—emerging. The palate is chewy and full with dark chocolate Golden Grahams and coffee bean a touch of cigar wrapper and licorice lying underneath. The finish turns savory still full-bodied and rich with oak coffee and black pepper. (2600 bottles)"
566,9,"Available for several years but now finally making its debut in the U.S. The higher-end Dewar’s expressions (Dewar’s 12 year old and Dewar’s Signature) are very good blends. This one is situated smartly between the two. The malt proportion is rich and creamy; the grain whisky is crisp and well-integrated. Antique gold color with notes of butterscotch vanilla wafer strawberry rhubarb pie and citrus drizzled with honey. Lovely floral notes in the aroma along with a pleasing dried spice finish. I could drink this stuff all day long!"
567,10,"This Pedro Ximénez-finished blend is the oldest Dewar’s expression available. It offers a deliciously deep nose of chocolate-dipped biscuits dried fruits and orange peel. The palate includes indulgent rewards of berry fruit chocolate praline raspberry cherry dried cranberry and hazelnut. It remains succulent throughout the sherry fruit keeping the upper hand over the chocolate and batting away the occasional coffee note. A dry finish with nutty chocolate and roasted spice. (Global Travel Retail only)"
568,10,"An enticing blend of aged single malt and grain whiskies from silent stills top-dressed with Port Ellen. The nose has soft fudge rosehip and honey lozenges with a thread of peat sewn through it. A distinct smokiness hangs above the glass. A mouthful exudes lemon sherbet honey-drizzled melon and white chocolate peaking with raspberry and mixed peel before a conclusion of banana-layered banoffee pie. An elegant finish of baked lemon and sweet oak. One for reflection. £350"
569,10,"A fantastically earthy whisky bristling with real grubby peat: more blazing bothy peat fire than coastal campfire. Fleeting elements of fudge and smoldering mellow cigar stubs. A smooth creamy blend with lemon curd vanilla sponge mint smoked prosciutto and a dollop of malt. There’s wonderfully smoky singeing heat at the back of the palate though it feels like the Islay peat has been pegged back for the 2015 batch. A succulent and smoky finish to warm the soul."
570,10,"Ovaltine Whoppers worn leather antique furniture medjool dates and black fruits on the nose. Sipping this whisky is an unexpected delight. Given the olfactory cues of advanced maturity it’s surprisingly nimble and still light on its toes. A charming opening of crumble filling with red currant cranberry raspberry and strawberry joined by apple pear and sultana with peppery spice. Chili heat and spicy finish. (Batch 6; 2000 bottles)"
571,10,"Imagine sipping this sophisticated libation at the supper club turned out in your best bib and tucker. There’s a purity to it with aromas of fresh red apples raisins in honey ground cinnamon and nutmeg leading to bitter orange oils and a storm of black pepper fading to tropical fruit layered caramel and sugared almonds. Hold this long in the mouth as it possesses a changing multi-faceted character. As Cab Calloway said “This is Hep.” (3456 bottles) £650"
572,7,"This Kickstarter-funded blend is a very savvy and seamless mix of 40% malt and 60% grain whiskies. Pale gold in color the nose is inviting with dried apricot honey tangerine and salt. Everything from the nose comes together on the palate which is soft and sweet with the right amount of oak and smoke to balance everything out. There's a dash of heat and a solid finish. Who'd ever expect such a smart and affable whisky to come from Kickstarter? (U.S. only)"
573,10,"Created by blender George Harper who worked on White Walker this has nutty toffee coffee grounds caramelized sugars roasted hazelnut in chocolate an appreciable grain note plus the titular gentle sweet peat smoke. Toasted oak chocolate praline sweet runny caramel coffee and a catch of smoke dissipate to leave the smooth flavor of creamy toffee penny candy. An uncut diamond with great potential set against the brilliance of Black Label. £30"
574,10,"A beautifully balanced blend of fudge vanilla strawberry bubble gum warm orange and cinnamon with ozone and peat smoke. Soft slightly bitter fruits melt into a creamy silky concoction of Horlicks white chocolate and vanilla with chewy toffee sweetness. The smoking embers of peat catch on the finish with a little menthol and peppermint. Robust enough for beach parties and weddings not just polo matches. (Global Travel Retail)"
575,10,"Rounded and expressive on the nose with a rich malty heart vanilla toffee apple chips dried banana and an array of freshly ground spices. Flavors of delicious caramel banana red apple and vanilla custard keep the taste buds occupied as the spices slowly build up a head of steam. The controlled delivery of flavor and balance from this blend is impressive though there’s still sufficient punch for mixing."
576,10,"Toasty granola rye crackers barley sugar sweetness and Murray Mints make for a balanced nose on this top-of-the-range blend representing the art deco elegance of 1920s Shanghai. A gloriously thick texture of rich citrus blossoms bolstered by toffee lime pineapple tropical fruits and vanilla sugar. Mr. Kinsman has engineered methodical and well-paced complexity here with emergent little lights of spiciness. A long-lasting deep orange buzz and dimming spice round off proceedings. A precious joy indeed. £115 Travel Retail exclusive"
577,10,"If Willy Wonka was ever inclined to condense a knickerbocker glory into a dram it would nose and taste like this: caramel toffee hints of cocoa peeled banana chewy marshmallows cream and gooey fudge sauce. The palate has banana slightly burnt caramel poached pear and Banoffee pie layered over mixed peel flavors adding to its delicious appeal. It’s sweet dry smooth and comforting like that final satisfying mouthful drained from a mug of hot chocolate. Comfort food for thirsty people."
578,9,"Amber gold color. Aromas of delicate fruit coconut vanilla and toffee with delicate background oak notes. The flavor delivers what the aroma promises. It is nicely balanced with a lingering dryish finish."
579,10,"With a heart of Glenburgie its bourbon barrel finish delivers a heady hit of vanilla red apples and brown sugar sweetness on the nose with support from baked hazelnut cookies and ground black pepper. Toffee apple pear vanilla salted caramel and a gentle pepperiness dissipate to reveal caramel heather honey pecan pie cocoa and dark chocolate. Try this with orange or cocoa bitters in your next Old Fashioned. £28"
580,1,"Not exactly a new whisky for the Jubilee just a new pack but it’s a good enough excuse to have a look at this top-end blend. Great maturity with masses of orchard fruits and a hint of passion fruit as well. The oak is rounded and supple while with water a banana note is released. Thick and chewy with more grip than suggested on the nose and a little nut on the finish. Great blending."
581,10,"The palo cortado finish is restrained with notes of pale sherry crisp green apple honeycomb cocoa cooked plum tangy citrus and tobacco smoke yet the palate has a generous mouth-drawing fruitiness. Lemon meringue pie tangerine zest lime and pineapple form the whisky’s substance which is augmented by a time-delayed progression through caramel ground almond espresso and chocolate brownie. Smoke hangs like a specter at the feast."
582,10,"An incredible surround-sound sensation of heavy peat smoke with toffee blackened spices salted caramel and warm leather. The journey is impressive from the sweet toffee torn asunder by huge gusts of pepper the tangy strands of citrus and banoffee pie with baked banana the apples baked in brown sugar before a final return to the smoke. A sweet and spicy finish though the flavors recede fairly rapidly."
583,10,"Dried heather peppercorn salt crystals green fruits dried fennel aniseed dry leaves and floral top notes produce a lip-smacking bouquet like a chilled manzanilla. The palate has vanilla tablet sweetness like the previous Delilah’s release though this is bottled at higher strength with flavors of dried fruits: peach apricot and mandarin. (8520 bottles)"
584,4,"A special bottling in recognition of Chicago's outstanding alternative rock venue Delilah's and like that venue this is full of character color grit and determination. It's sweet but never cloying soft and honeyed but gutsy and there are peppermint licorice and fresh hay notes in the mix too. It's spent time in bourbon wood and that shows. A departure for Compass Box but a healthy one."
585,10,"The youngest in an excellent new range that combines small-batch blending by Doug McIvor with dramatic monochrome Scottish landscape photography by Lindsay Robertson each image a visual metaphor for the whisky. Toffee cherry rich fruit walnut marmalade vanilla essence ripe banana seasoned oak and aromatic whole spices. The palate is charming and indulgent with rich fruitcake banoffee pie a good dose of spice and a silky finish. £89"
586,4,"So how brave can you be? Would you take one of the world's most iconic blends and risk messing with it? If you've got a whisky maker as good as Jim Beveridge then why not? This picks up from the regular JW Black and its signature Caol Ila smoke and peat heart and then adds to it doing exactly what it says on the tin. But the clever part of this is upping the apple orange and fruit content too. Great."
587,10,"Sherry finishing influences from leather satchel maraschino cherry floral blossoms and deep orange notes to a pinch of Chinese Five Spice and buttered ginger loaf. Medium bodied with a malt content of 75% it riffs around an orange theme at times quite sharp with pith some bitter grapefruit more ginger and herbal strands. Lively spices flicker across the tongue throughout the long finish as the citrus seeps away."
588,10,"Wheat corn and malted barley are your three grains here. Orange grove before harvest a rounded candied peel note plenty of sweet grain and creamy vanilla all backed by gentle spice. Luscious and chewy caramel taffy candy lavishly rich orange and glowing spice notes wrap around the tongue. It’s incredible how they can make this tasty blend of five whiskies look so devastatingly easy (when it’s not). Value Pick"
589,10,"A delicious dram with a sunny disposition this drums out aromas of butter biscuits raisins vanilla sugar cane honey and abundant tropical fruit notes of guava and papaya. It’s a light and nimble blend that weaves through white chocolate biscuit notes chewy granola bar apricot and mandarin. Spices rattle around a fruit core on the finish. Rum powerhouse Bacardi acquired Dewar’s in 1998; they should have done this years ago. Best Values"
590,4,"The Real McCoy! It's said that during Prohibition Bill McCoy serviced the better speakeasies with proper Cutty Sark; hence the name. If this is a recreation of what they might have been drinking back then you can see why they kept fighting over it. This is another bold earthy smoky blend with oily industrial notes. There's crabapple smoke bitter lemon grapefruit and even black currant. It would seem blended whisky is where it's at right now! Great stuff."
591,10,"The divine stone fruit aromas are the key to unlocking the nose on this one: apricot honey vanilla icing malt bins Quaker Oats Squares and lofty floral top notes. Sweet mandarin brown sugar vanilla fudge strands of finely shredded peel and more spice than the 12 year old can muster. The sweet vanilla aftertaste is softer and more elegant than the younger expressions."
592,10,"Cherry pound cake ground almond and light vanilla with delicious layers of sherry
and top notes of acacia honey on the nose. Surprisingly nimble on the palate with
apple waves of sherry black cherry jelly and a gentle buildup of spice then caramel
dark sugar vanilla and red apple in later phases though it is still light on its feet. A
smooth clean finish propels more vigorous spice notes across the palate. (Travel
Retail exclusive)"
593,10,"Dry peats tossed on a driftwood fire with coastal aromas of sun-scorched seaweed beside high tide rock pools comprise this refined dram. A momentary glimpse of lighter lemon lime and pineapple is quickly snuffed out by the full strength assault. It’s like pulling the pin on a grenade. There’s a dense barrage of peat moss worn leather and cocoa at the death. Ride through it to glory. Possibly the highest ABV that Compass Box has ever given us. £120"
594,10,"Here’s one in the eye for people who grumble about high prices for age statement whisky. Sherry aromas good-quality plain chocolate clove-studded oranges coffee beans and fat sultanas. Thick gloopy texture with lashings of sherry mouth-drawing tannins a pleasant buzz of wood spices peppery chocolate and coffee dregs. It emerges from a savory middle section to a burnt orange salvation followed by a hot oaky finish. £148"
595,10,"A beautiful blush-toned whisky with red currant cranberry and light toffee; the delicate spices beautifully integrated with the soft fruits on the nose. Flavors of dried apricots honey and vanilla sugar offer a sweet smooth creaminess with hints of butterscotch cherry syrup and lingering fine-ground pepper. Adding this latest port finish to its range Dewar’s bolsters the resurgence of the 8 year old age statement in scotch whisky. (Best Value)"
596,10,"This radiant refreshing whisky offers creamy fudge light vanilla fresh apple peach and biscuit notes on the nose demonstrating the generosity of the American oak. In the mouth it’s luscious balanced and mouth-coating with sweet honey lemon peel lime zest and aromatic spices fattening out briefly before becoming soft as suede riffing on vanilla melon and lemon biscuits. Dry finish with vanilla cream and soft fruits."
597,10,"Blender Aimée Gibson’s experimental batch 7 is designed as a sherry finished Black Label. Beautifully smoky with dried fruits charred oak wood spices vanilla cocoa and bonfire smoke. Toffee flavors with thick smoke red fruits orange raisin oak spice gingerbread marshmallow strawberry jam and dark marmalade. Dry finish with bitter peels dark chocolate and some feisty spices. In comparison regular Black Label is silkier more integrated and more peppery. (Global Travel Retail only)"
598,10,"On safe territory here with neroli oil caramel roasted spices surly peat smoke and just enough fruity sweetness to stay in the good books. Weightier than the 15 year old with more aged whisky characteristics: bright clementine dried citrus wheels and clove but after an eruption of smoke it fades to pineapple fermenting fruits and a prickly grapefruit acidity. The ashy embers on the finish retreat quickly."
599,12,"Toast spread with raspberry jam lemon slice in hot tea zwieback crackers nutty malt earthy oak and a touch of spice on the nose. Sweet and velvety on the palate with earthy malt hazelnuts chocolate red apple raspberry lemon and a pinch of cinnamon and dried ginger. The medium-length finish is well rounded with semi-sweet chocolate toasted nuts and rich oak. Great balance on this mild-mannered but never one-note whisky."
600,10,"For a Highball you want a whisky with enough spice flavor and strength to carry through. This just nails it. An innovative 100% malted barley single blend of Coffey still and pot still distillates from Loch Lomond it bursts with toasted oat aromas cinnamon white pepper hazelnut and soft dried apricot. Quaker Oat Squares spice thick textured honey mint chocolate and graham cracker with a short sharp spicy finish."
601,10,"This blend has style. Coils of red apple peel ripe orange cherry blossom florals freshly split oak and dry gentle spices like running a wet finger around an old spice jar. It’s juicy and thick with festive satsumas some bright sharpness and acidic citrus overcome by juicy sweetness marmalade flavors and walnut. The refined finish has a tangle of spice orange peel honey and just a whiff of struck match."
602,10,"Maraschino cherries red currant oak bark and wet slate on the nose after 6 months of finishing. Light clean opening with cherry and strawberry; a little fig and raisin bring depth. Hints of clove and aniseed dart about then more oak swells up though the red fruity sweetness stays in control. A smooth finish of fruit chews with those spices burning brightly deep in the back of the throat. (769 bottles)"
603,10,"Alasdair Day is on a mission to build a new Lowland distillery in the Borders of Scotland. While we wait the next batch from his grandfather’s cellar book is a pale golden dram with a delectable nose of lemon meringue pie spring blossoms peach pit candy floss and Valrhona Ivoire white chocolate. This is more-ish whisky: like spooning into panna cotta. Pear syrup white chocolate and a sizzle of toasted muffins dissipate into a mild ginger and gooseberry finish. £40"
604,10,"Named for House Targaryen from Game of Thrones. Aromas of malt peppercorn dry chile flakes spicy nachos sliced red apples roasted whole spices and soft smoke from snuffed candles. On the palate this has a light floaty texture with flavors of red apple at its core followed by a roar of spice citrus peel lemon sharp fruity acidity vanilla pod and a touch of walnut. The finish is lengthy and spicy."
605,10,"Bold forward flavors on the nose with spiced stewed apple nutmeg dunnage floors and a waft of grilled mushroom settling down to peeled cooking apples and sour plum candy. Spices run through a malty palate of fudge cooked apple cinnamon and butterscotch with grain notes oat bars and a hint of chocolate nibs. A little reticent at first but it’s worth persevering to get better acquainted with this dram. (2400 bottles)"
606,10,"Bold spicy nose with dark toffee and dried chili flakes. Explosive pepper notes duel with chocolate as they work through the toffee flavors and begin to show a bitter dark chocolate edge. It’s a gutsy spirited blend with tongue-searing spices eventually serving up more sweet notes but consider adding water or pouring over ice to release more vanilla fruits and milk chocolate flavors to take the adventure further."
607,10,"This rich smooth and enticing blend first launched in 1976. It offers aromas of barley malt honey praline cookies vanilla seed and smoke. The palate is bright with honey citrus zest Quaker Oat Crisp graham cracker and vanilla fudge with gentle pepper hot cross bun and orange notes appearing as it becomes creamier. Orange barley notes and smoke dance off into the finish."
608,4,"Cutty Sark lost its way in recent years; expect that to change soon. Its owners have plans to return it to glory (and to include a 30 year old among its expressions — you read it here first). For the time being — if you can find it — this 18 year old is a sublime mix of soft plum and peach sweet pure grain easy-drinking vanilla and a deft oakiness all delivered in gentle and harmonious fashion. Masterful blending."
609,9,"Gold-amber color. Toffee fruit and a wisp of smoke underpin floral aromas. On the palate flavors are nicely balanced and harmoniously interwoven. Gently sweet toffee notes up front gradually yield to drier notes on the finish with soft delicate fruit flavors throughout."
610,10,"Take a parcel of Macallan Glenrothes and Tamdhu all aged over 40 years season lightly with gently peated Bunnahabhain and North British grain whisky and what do you get? Golden sultanas linseed oil orange blossom honey butterscotch drying nuttiness and cedarwood. Blending has beneficially enhanced the three sherry-casked malts. It’s juicy and sticky rhubarb and damson jams oak tannins and a little burnt note as the power swells. Cocoa chocolate and lingering oak to finish. (210 bottles) £350"
611,10,"The nose unravels with milk chocolate thick hazelnut spread and a slender twist of orange peel though that delectable goodness is evenly balanced with peppermint patties and detectable light floral top notes. This has a lush softness with a perceptibly slow crescendo of flavors incorporating caramel toffee popcorn and chocolate praline. It’s beautifully integrated with a smooth dense texture and releases its grip reluctantly with just a whisper of a peppermint reprise."
612,9,"Quite rich and chewy with nutty toffee vanilla fudge nougat chocolate cake orchard fruit and black cherry—all on a solid malty foundation. This isn’t one of those elegant lighter-flavored blends with a high grain whisky content. The focus here is on fullness of flavor. A blend for the malt whisky drinker (but should also appeal to the more open-minded blend drinker too)."
613,10,"Malt biscuits runny caramel blended black tea melting butter sliding across a hot skillet the leather uppers on new Oxfords and a more enjoyable waft of peat smoke than expected. Clean light flavors; lime jelly root ginger initially not overly sweet then a boost of honey caramelized fruits with toffee and cocoa later still. It’s pricked with hints of smoke throughout with a long finish of pepper and other spices. Perfectly enjoyable anytime."
614,10,"This is how to age gracefully. A remarkable decadent drop released to follow the success of the Golden Age blend this delivers heather honey tangerine juice banana chips dried apricots and sanded oak. It’s a whisky of big expansive flavors. Citrus strands candied peel neroli and dried mango swirl amidst a syrupy mouthfeel steadily becoming creamier as it squeezes out yet more flavor. Dry oaky finish with residual fruit coffee beans and pleasingly bitter oak tannins that tingle the gums. £600"
615,10,"A zeitgeist Johnnie Walker fine-tuned for the American palate this blend has a moreish nose of cinnamon cocoa and the toasted coconut of macaroons mingled with strands of smoke dried walnut nutmeg and an array of spicy rye anchored by a concentrated line of vanilla. Lots of American oak at play here. It’s elegant dry and smooth with vanilla cinnamon coconut and flashes of spice. It’s fabulous sipped straight up but keep walking to the finish. Value Pick."
616,10,"This whisky is slowly making its way around the world but it was worth the wait as master blender Colin Scott’s use of mizunara oak makes for an impressively different nose from Chivas Regal 12 year old. Pecans sandalwood coriander seed honeycomb peanuts and rich oak aromas herald a warming dram with fabulously developed orange zest and vanilla toffee flavors before a more assertive finish of dark toffee and tenacious spices."
617,10,"Heather honey sultry smoke sherry and spice make this the ideal hibernation libation. Help see off the darkest months with these dominant orange notes and a supporting cast of crystalized ginger cinnamon and nutmeg. A warming taste of red berries gingerbread and Christmas spices gives the underside of the tongue a roasting before melting away leaving a creamy mouthfeel imbued with strands of subtle smoke barrel char and spiced orange."
618,4,"Blended whiskies have taken a sexy turn for the better and there have been some excellent attempts to innovate. Indeed a gap has opened up between main label blends and this sort of thing which is particularly brave because a world-class brand has let amateurs loose on it. That said this is massive with big earthy spice peat and sour fruits. There's some youthful sappiness in the mix too but it's not detrimental. Brave and impressive."
619,10,"The nose is a little attenuated but shows off tarte au citron cigar smoke blood orange and some gentle spices. The rich fruity palate has a flawless immaculate quality with tangy orange spice caramel ground almond vanilla and orange sherbet but what it gains in smoothness it loses in producing a substantial firework moment to really stimulate the palate. A polished blend in search of some perfect imperfections."
620,10,"A straightforward proposition of honey vanilla sponge cake barley notes hints of apple fresh banana melon and bundles of dry straw. It’s a sweetheart: soft vanilla fudge heather honey banana-topped banoffee pie fudge vanilla sandwich cookies barley sugar and lemon peel with hardly any spice in the early phase. The finish has a snag of pepper at the end but this is gorgeously tasty with smooth vanilla fudge all the way."
621,10,"This balances sweetness vanilla and smoke extremely well and I found it preferable
to Monkey Shoulder for sipping neat. On the palate there’s sweet smoke from
blackened oak logs fragrant spices a well-developed vanilla note and a hint of
orange peel. The structure hangs lightly and more weight behind the smoke would
have been preferable but the sweetness and spice yield to lovely creamy vanilla
flavors banana and a finish of milky coffee. £32"
622,10,"A pale blend with hidden depths of flavor and a sweet nose of honeyed pear vanilla Golden Delicious apples taffy and custard tarts all overlaid with ashy smoke and drifting smoke trails from snuffed-out candles. Pear apple clove and cracked black pepper meet butter toffee vanilla and nippy spices. It’s imbued with a pretty smoky flavor for a peated cask and leaves a creamy aftertaste to savor. £32"
623,10,"Matthew Gloag introduced this classic blend in 1896 and now Kirsteen Campbell master blender of Grouse since 2016 is taking it to new heights. Rich toffee boundless baked orange notes wood spices dried banana chips and some sweet floral top notes. Very smooth drinking with citrus flavors toffee and caramel vanilla ground ginger star anise and lemon peel. The spiciness abounds into the finish with well-rounded dark orange notes."
624,10,"Compared to classic Grouse this has more caramel notes additional sweetness and a greater delivery of lemon vanilla toasted coconut and finely shredded orange peel. It’s lightly structured drier and comes with less-pronounced spices. Sipping reveals sweet light citrus smooth caramel vanilla sponge apricot soft fruits and chocolate macaroon bars with a late development of spice. Sweet caramel hangs on the lips. This is an easygoing feel-good whisky."
625,10,"Peated Glenturret lies at the heart of Smoky Black but where will the master blender find her smoke when the distillery is sold? Contemporary bottlings are rich warming and comfortingly smoky with chocolate malt cocoa burnt fruitcake and baking spices. Medium-weighted blend with malt chocolate and bourbon biscuits interwoven with smoke then cherry baked apple strudel and chocolate desserts. Dry smoke ginger pepper and dark chocolate to finish."
626,12,"Rich aromas of marzipan black tea blackberry cherry chocolate brown sugar and tobacco leaves. The palate is chewy with oak char black tea roasted nuts semi-sweet chocolate root beer spices ginger red apple and mint; water brings out cinnamon and pecans. It shows vivaciousness into the finish with more oak char mint black pepper and chocolate-covered almonds. (2000 bottles)"
627,10,"A polished nose of red apple cinnamon caramels and salted almonds makes for an enticing prospect on this showpiece dram. The taste exemplifies smoothness. The indulgent palate comprises dark cooked fruits coffee malty cocoa sticky toffee pudding fudge and a fine line of orange. Roll it around the mouth: the integrated aged grains enable these select malts to achieve their full flavor potential. An exceptionally long finish has remnants of that toffee pudding and a well-sucked aniseed ball. Treat yourself."
628,10,"Need you ask? An unmistakable classic and an exemplar of a blended Scotch whisky famous around the world. Toffee swirling caramel whole almond and mashed banana amid twisting white smoke. The palate has such poise balance and dexterity that it sets the standard for many less accomplished blends to aspire to. Conspicuously iconic and the closest thing you will find to a complete whisky at this price."
5516,9,"A pleasing malt all around if not overly complex or challenging. Clean full malt foundation (the Lomond still is obvious) vanilla and butterscotch with soft fruit and balancing dry oak spice that lingers on the finish."
629,10,"Lighter in character than the 50 year old batch 4 offers aromas of caramel artisanal chocolate red fruits polished brogues and a fluttering of Asian spices. It has plenty of personality with molasses chocolate treacle cake date fig bramble and black currant though those spices return and then it gets rather woody. A sprightly older blend but beginning to show its age. (1428 bottles)"
630,10,"Sliced apple fig rolls hot chocolate powder baked orange seasoned oak and a wisp of light smoke like a red glow from burning newspaper. It has a contented unperturbed insouciant character. Cinnamon toffee yields to sweeter notes with vanilla dried fruits and baked peach and then goes long on nutmeg under drifting smoke. The woodiest of Walkers this concludes with cinnamon nutmeg clove allspice and a catch of smoke. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
631,10,"Beeswax candles wafers in vanilla ice cream dried apricots a strand of garden bonfire smoke dried-out wedges of honeydew melon and fruit shortcake cookies. The palate revels in barley sugar active spices lime orange and grapefruit peel and it’s beautifully weighted with fudge and vanilla sponge cake. A mouth-clinging finish saturates the taste buds with sweet honeyed fruits."
632,4,"Master blender Sandy Hyslop has deliberately attempted to capture Christmas in the glass and so it should come as no surprise to find a rich full and flavorsome whisky with sherry trifle red berries orange fruit and mince pie filling in the mix. It's put together with grace and style mixes well and is that rare beast — a blend that can be enjoyed on its own."
633,10,"Rather elegant blend with aromas of woodworker’s bench salted cashew and dried banana chips all backed by gentle bonfire smoke. Creamy caramel toffee Victoria sponge red currant raspberry and more oak build into a thick luscious mouthful. Any smoke drifts away in the initial seconds. Toffee and fruit linger making a very lengthy finish. A masterful top of the range blend from La Martinquaise. Well worth seeking out. €55"
634,10,"For starters this new addition to the lineup has a delicious nose of baked Alaska cotton candy vanilla and creamy fudge along with well-developed notes of toasted oak from the virgin casks. A smooth blend of caramel banana peach green fruits and hazelnut. It grows increasingly tangy in the mouth before softening to leave lively peppery spices and toffee to conclude this affordable everyday sipper. (Global Travel Retail)"
635,4,"Pronounced “Te Veg” this has its roots in the Isle of Skye and as there’s only one distillery there it’s highly likely that the odd
drop of Talisker has found its way into the mix. Whether it has or not this is stirring stuff non-chill filtered so that the flavors burst forth. As you might expect it’s rugged with brine and chili giving it a distinctive spice edge. But the delivery is a caramel fudge delight with luxury chocolate praline in there too."
636,10,"Aromas of oloroso sherry strawberry almond paste clove licorice Allsorts black treacle and smoke from burning haystacks. Honeyed palate with citrus elements light lemon green melon pear redcurrant and pineapple brightened by some well-rounded spices and root ginger. It glides into a mouthful of chocolate-coated digestive biscuits with a little smoke then a finish of citrus oils fruit skins and active spices. Brilliant and satisfying."
637,10,"A mixture of butter toffee vanilla dried fruit Oreo cookies candied peel fennel seed and white pepper on the nose. The palate shows vanilla toffee blackened oak macaroon bars rich malt and robust peppercorn spiciness. Yes it’s full-bodied and satisfyingly malty bathing the tongue in deliciously smooth toffee flavors with blackened staves and plenty of spice on the finish but it’s a bit too straightforward. Vanilla in more ways than one."
638,10,"The style and class of the youngest was inspired by the classic elegance of Paris in the 1920s. Comprising Kininvie and Girvan married in tuns of Portuguese oak this is pure creamy goodness bathing in lemon meringue pie vanilla tablet and fresh oak shavings. A buttery-soft texture the back of the palate kicks off with honey explosions nougat and toffee backed with a distinct oakiness to remind you that it’s got much more to offer than just vanilla playfulness. £50 Travel Retail exclusive"
639,10,"I’m reminded of leafy ferns in spring sweet melon green bananas fresh cream and a dusting of spice when I nose this blend. A light green fruit taste of white grape and melon overlaid with runny toffee and banana before the impression of thick fruit skins becoming slightly tannic. Light spices and pepper follow with a finish of apple core and rich spice. (760 bottles)"
640,10,"When in doubt the answer to any question is usually ‘more whisky.’ Here peat smoke takes an upper hand over the sweet aromas of juicy orange and pear. The whisky begins icing-sugar sweet settles to bubble gum pear apple and malt showing its impeccably balanced finely textured character replete with strands of oak spices gentle smoke baked pastry and vanilla custard. You can’t go wrong at this price."
641,10,"Chillingly good bottle for winter this Game of Thrones tie-in sees a rakish striding man donning body armor gripping an ice blade and nodding a frosty greeting through glowing blue eyes. Room temperature aromas speak of toffee lime zest menthol waxy foliage and pronounced grain notes. Straight from the freezer there are cornflakes beeswax caramel vanilla sharp citrus sugared apple and a hint of nutmeg. Deliciously tasty dram for your night’s watch. Best Value"
642,9,"Gold color. Floral aromas balanced with a gentle vanilla sweetness and soft fruit. Soft rounded body. The palate delivers what the aroma promises in a very clean and balanced way. Pleasing finish."
643,10,"Sherbet creamy vanilla whole lemon fresh baked goods sweet grain notes strong floral blooms with hints of snuff and ground pepper on the nose. Light delicate palate of lemon flesh; the citrus sharpens up with grapefruit flavors supported by fine ground pepper and a lasting wave of vanilla. A pleasing tingle of spices on the finish coupled with punchy citrus notes. A nimble vigorous blend that offers a multitude of serves. Best Values"
644,4,"I was surprised to find that Grant’s blends were noticeable by their absence in the U.S. But with the purchase of Tuthilltown in New York and Tullamore Dew in Ireland that is slowly changing; and here's proof. Beautiful honeyed rich but the 40% ABV makes it the whisky equivalent of a radio DJ cutting off “Freebird” before the solo at the end. Still great and indeed better than most competition but not the classic it could be."
645,10,"Baked almond desserts liberally splashed with cream light caramel malted milk and an invading cloud of smoke from newly ignited twigs: a lucky strike from a forest survivalist. On the palate it is soft and blushing with marmalade and warm butter ground ginger moving to chocolate orange toffee and Ovaltine. A whirl of spices and chunky chocolate round off this blend’s finish stylishly. This has all the hallmarks of a perfect nightcap."
646,12,"Bakery shop character throughout starting with raspberry thumbprint cookies hazelnuts orange peel and crème brûlée on the nose. The creamy palate is sweet with black and white cookie frosted vanilla cake coconut pudding and chocolate-covered frozen banana finishing with more of the same. Balanced and well textured with a simplicity that’s easy to enjoy. (Best Value)"
647,10,"A futuristic bottle design released for Ridley Scott’s replicant sequel set in 2049 hence the punchy bottling strength. Peat smoke toffee caramels fresh banana and sliced red apple. Promising layers of fruit salad grape apple citrus and apricot are swept aside by an aggressive peppery attack emerging to notes of bitter fruit burnt rubber and smoke. If this is a glimpse of the future I’m stockpiling regular Black Label now. (39000 bottles)"
648,10,"Was the short finish in Château La Louvière casks from Bordeaux’s Pessac-Léognan appellation sufficient to impact this peaty whisky? A gorgeous color with a nose of sooty charcoal intensity hints of chocolate vanilla pod clove and peppercorn. Flavors of cherry rhubarb orange peel and plums speckled with aniseed pepper clove and licorice indicate cask influence. Suggestions of menthol and peppermint before a smoky finish with licorice and bitter chocolate. (20000 bottles)"
649,10,"Up close this displays more sherry and dried fruits particularly raisins currants and sultanas with a deep strawberry note and dollop of marmalade. Quite pungent and that resonates rewardingly at the back of the throat. The juicy mandarin flavor has some tartness but then there’s cake mix gingersnaps clove and toasted spices though it gravitates back to the marmalade. The finish has dry bitter orange ginger and spice with a hint of lime zest. Confident and characterful."
650,10,"A ripe proposition the fruit and the smoke locked tightly together like interwoven fingers. Peaches melon baked apple fresh mango and sugar strands with a supporting role of red berries. With a malt content exceeding two-thirds the full-bodied palate is sweet as brown sugar with mandarin tartness apple and red licorice meandering to a vinous finish of red berry fruit. With its cheeky Glasgow landmark on the label this permanent addition to the GKS range is pure gallus."
651,10,"A smashing rich sherry nose showcases rosehip elderberry scorched oak pipe tobacco roasted coriander seeds and damp dunnage warehouses. The core of the flavor is the lush orange jelly hidden in McVitie’s Jaffa cakes combined with clove malt treacle dried mango and ginger. Water draws out stronger performances from the malty notes together with some red berry characteristics. Let it roll around the mouth it’s terrific stuff (Batch 1 148 bottles). £57"
652,4,"Arguably the most successful of the Famous Grouse extensions (well the competition includes Snow Grouse for Pete's sake!) the Black Grouse brought ever-popular peat into the mix a move that was followed by a peatier version of Johnnie Walker Black Label. The label says this is richer and peatier and it is. But this scores most for a chicory/coffee and liquid licorice undercarpet that makes it very palatable indeed. Neat over ice. (Travel Retail exclusive)€33"
653,10,"This Glenkinchie malt and Cameronbridge grain blend highlights the vanilla character of Black Label with a nose of green apple dry grasses vanilla toffee peach pit and banana custard with subtle hints of oak and spice. The mouthfeel is light with green apple and candied lemon growing fruitier with boiled candies and a hint of creaminess all held in check by the spice. Grassy finish with a hefty backdraft of spice."
654,10,"If you like sherried malts you’ll love this! Bottled at a respectable strength too. Red apple cherry skins strawberry raspberry Eccles cake malt loaf and warming spices; there’s a lot to get your nose into here. A finely structured dram with soft leather rhubarb Bramley apple cherryade fresh Victoria plum pepper and muted ginger deliver sustained flavors. A long spicy and peeled fruit finish. Given the distillery closures in 1983 there could be some interesting components in here. (464 bottles)"
655,10,"Thick orange peels grapefruit lime zest and Starburst taffy candies keep the nose of this premium expression within the purview of the Black Bull character. Layers of vanilla custard mellow fruit and ginger snaps quench an initial rush of sharp citrus. Sponge cake creaminess abounds though the spices nibble at the edges leaving a long sweet citrus finish. Water nips the more acidic elements while leaving the citrus flavors intact."
656,10,"Just eight whiskies in the blend married and finished in first fill Spanish sherry and bourbon casks. An insistent nose crackling with spices with toasted Eccles cake anointed with grated nutmeg vanilla extract cassia and dark soy sauce. Light honey and vanilla tangerine oils and lime peel exhibit perfectly-paced development with flavor building over a minute or more. Warming ginger spices and tropical fruits of guava and papaya close out this first annual special edition. Impressive work."
657,10,"If you like warm chocolate ganache sprinkled with cocoa beans dark waffle cones praline and brisket bark then this is for you. A brief flicker of chocolate smoke cherry peppery spices and chili flakes move aside for a smooth medley of dark fruit juiciness and sweetened char notes. The strident call of chocolate on nosing goes unreciprocated on the palate. A long satisfying deep finish of pounding spices. A worthy successor to the first batch. (417 bottles) £123"
658,10,"Refill bourbon American oak and virgin oak are the woods in question. Technically they are all American oak just at different flavor-giving stages of their productive lives. Honey fresh apricot floral and supple barley notes candied orange star anise dried chili and a touch of aniseed. Exceptionally smooth with caramel date red fruits chocolate and pecan pie finishing with wood char and spice. One wood three ways I grant you. Previously labeled as Grant’s Family Reserve"
659,10,"I am hopeful this blended whisky has benefited from the alligator char treatment to contribute to the deep rich color and charred smoke notes on the nose. A thick velvety mouthfeel with butter toffee toasted marshmallows going gooey on a stick great spices vanilla whole nutmeg chicory and the crust of a well-fired fruit loaf leaving some sooty cinders on the finish. A mighty fireside companion and my favorite Grand Macnish to date."
660,4,"This is a special bottling for London department store Selfridge's but it represents a clever strategy by artisan Compass Box to set its own agenda by regionalizing its whiskies. This is a long way from the New York blend—indeed creamier and sweeter than other recent releases. It has a honey heart traces of cinnamon and menthol in the mix plus wispy smoke. There's some spice and peat late on but in relatively subdued form. Very pleasant. £85"
661,10,"Blender Aimée Gibson set out to make a sundowner scotch by incorporating whiskies matured in wine casks. The blueberry blackcurrant and fresh oak aromas continue on to the palate: fruit compote raspberry strawberry and lingonberry with light spices. A late resurgence of dark toffee chocolate and cigar smoke blow into the finish. Sip away by all means but this fruity sensation calls to be served up in long cool drinks."
662,4,"Hankey Bannister includes some stunning aged whiskies in its range but given the trend toward unaged scotch releases I was a bit suspicious of this. It lacks depth but nevertheless is a butterfly in a breeze of a whisky; gossamer light both tantalizing and elusive. It’s liquid honey with sweet lime and pear some cocoa and to give it a modicum of depth it’s underpinned
by a light saltiness."
663,10,"The nose presents pencil shavings finely tuned aromatic spices vanilla toffee peppercorn clove and milk chocolate caramels. The palate opens with quick flashes of lime followed by vanilla toffee citrus-tinged sweetness and clamorous peppery spices then becomes more malty and slackens into flavors of butterscotch ice cream cone and ground nuts. Lingering malty sweetness on the finish with hints of blackened oak though the spices have the final word. A satisfying pour."
664,10,"Lean and crisp grain notes on the nose with Bramley apple peels warm gentle spices a little vanilla fudge dry grasses and custard cream biscuits. The flavors are sweet with creamy buttercream vanilla honey banana and a streak of mild spices though it’s not until the finish that the spices really steal the show making for a more impactful tasting experience. Solid decent and worth a try."
665,10,"Lord Elcho was an 18th century ancestor of William Wemyss who fought on Bonnie Prince Charlie’s side at the Battle of Culloden in 1745. With a minimum of 40% malt this fine blend has a rather perfumed nose of fresh mint green apple sliced melon and tropical fruits. The soft candy sugar and butterscotch palate builds with layers of malt cherry laces gingerbread and pfeffernüsse leading to a ginger and spice finish of significant length. Highly accomplished. £26"
666,10,"A charmingly sweet nose with Christmas cake swollen raisin dates sticky toffee pudding walnut nutmeg and gentle spices confirm the presence of the oloroso cask at work. An oily texture with butterscotch tangy peel and mandarin becoming darker and nutty with sultana and plum skin shading into menthol and streaks of bitterness. Finally Brazil nut macadamia and clove with a hot dry nutty finish. (771 bottles)"
667,9,"Chivas's new entry into the premium blend category. A complex whisky (on the nose and palate) in the same vein as Chivas 18 only deeper with more caramelized sweetness darker fruit and greater emphasis on dried spices and roasted nuts (and perhaps even tobacco). Everything moves along nicely -- and entertainingly -- until the whisky approaches the finish on the palate. Its age begins to show as spicy oak dryness and suggestions of polished leather begin to dominate through to the finish. An enjoyable whisky but I prefer the 18 year old to the 25 year old for its impeccable balance."
668,9,"An example that older more expensive isn’t always better this 18 year old gem is as good as many blends twice its price. The foundation of Johnnie Walker Gold is delicate clean and honeyed along with a fresh sea character (from Clynelish?) that provides a youthful zing. Notes of vanilla shortbread tropical fruit freshly cut hay marshmallow and even a hit of peat round out the palate. Its finish is subtly complex and nicely balanced. The blend has improved nicely over the past several years."
669,10,"The aromas can be split into four; fresh fruits (raspberry blueberry) desserts (vanilla custard bread and butter pudding) antique shop (polished furniture well-oiled moving parts) and stewed fruits (apple rhubarb some old orange peel). Wisps of balsa wood smoke; tangy orange notes build accompanied by those fresh fruits sweet oak aniseed and white pepper ending on black treacle and gingerbread. The finish is epically long; dry floral with parkin residual wood notes and further smoke evident. (800 bottles)"
670,10,"This lighter fruity spicy whisky is not for peat lovers. Bourbon whisky and rum casks were used for finishing resulting in a nose of rich honey golden syrup peach stone apricot honeydew coriander seed ginger and white pepper. Citrus butter fudge dried and tropical fruits rumbling spices and tangy orange create a creamy combination from which a familiar Johnnie Walker identity suddenly snaps into place. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
671,12,"An entrancing nose shows ripe apples and peaches blueberry pie earthy and saline peat and fresh citrus. Although light the palate has an enjoyable fruity character with layers of grapefruit candy apple kettle corn wild berry and orange Creamsicle. Water does not benefit this—drink it as-is. Aged at least 5 years. (Total Wine & More)"
672,12,"A delicate blend that manages to express richness in its simplicity. Perfumy and floral on the nose. On the palate coconut marzipan and golden raisin flavors show the grain component but they’re buttressed by chocolate strawberries and orange oil leading into a satisfying oak and chocolate-orange finish. (Total Wine & More)"
673,4,"Great King Street was our Blend of the Year two years ago and Compass Box wondered where to take it next. So they have released two versions asking customers to decide between them by voting online. The other one is peated and will probably win easily which is a shame because this is a more subtle and better whisky. Sherry syrup honey apple and sultanas are all here but nuanced. Delightful. £30"
674,10,"Originally created by Lombard for the Freemasons this has a flavorsome nose of dark chocolate chip cookies light spices coconut macaroons malt and bright fresh bananas. The palate is light and unobtrusive with honey and malt reinforced by the spices running underneath. A shift develops to some later cocoa and chocolate notes and the mocha finish fades gracefully. A finely balanced concoction and you will rarely find this quality and flavor for the price"
675,10,"A limited edition blend with more than 75 percent malt content containing grains from 1978 and 1979 and malts from 1982. A genteel nose exudes white chocolate vanilla slice butterscotch fresh apricots and salted pecans. Commanding and rich it luxuriates in bitter orange ripe apricots marmalade dairy toffees cinnamon and raspberry with a finish of Seville orange rind. It’s a little blander with water toward baked lemons and barley sugar so resist and take it as it comes. £190"
676,9,"Deep on the nose and palate with notes of dark rum dried fruit roasted nuts dark chocolate cinnamon polished leather charcoal and a suggestion of peat.  Dry resinous finish.  Bonus points for intrigue."
677,10,"Lemon and lime grapefruit peel and vanilla sugar are the most striking
characteristics with base notes of caramel milk chocolate and dry spices to round off
the nose. Vanilla fudge and muted peppery spices on a lightweight structure but it
blossoms in flavor—if not mouthfeel—with citrus peel creamy milk chocolate and
coffee notes leaving cocoa spices and citrus acidity on the finish. (Travel Retail
exclusive)"
678,10,"Double-aged with a finish in Ilegal reposado mezcal casks it has a zesty nose with plenty of bite: lime cut grass new bookbindings grapefruit juice and lilies. The glutinous mouthfeel has more mezcal influence with dull fruit herbal features caramel a snarl of pepper and chile flakes and lengthy smoke and spice to finish. A bold creation but I’m going to need more persuasion that this enhances the scotch."
679,10,"The port cask finish wraps the toffee and baked orange in an extra layer of richness. There is subtlety in the aroma of the port notes with red cherry and dried cranberry mingling with well-integrated spices in the background. Richer dark caramels infused with red fruits including cranberry red currant and pomegranate chased by feisty spices. The finish has concentrated red fruit juices nougat and long-lasting spices."
680,10,"Kyloe is the old Scots name for the famous hairy horned breed of Highland beef cattle better known in Scotland as a Heilan coo. This bright NAS whisky has aromas of fresh orange lemon grapefruit and light muscovado sugar. It is soft and sweet to drink with lemon sherbet notes some fruity piquancy and rich butterscotch with some peppermint creeping in on the finish."
681,10,"Intended to recreate the spirit of James and John Chivas this blend uses high proportions of Longmorn and Strathisla malts. The nose has green apples peaches in syrup blended honey and oat flapjacks. A soft and light opener of orange sherbet melon and dried apple. Dilution yields a delicious creamy texture with more assertive citrus flavors and bitter peel showing by the end. A distinctive character from the regular 12 year old but this should be regarded as an equal. £40"
682,10,"The assured Scotch whisky that became one of the classic blends. Dry and sweet with a nose of vanilla sponge fresh cut flowers and marzipan over a malty base. Pleasingly oily with flavors of burning butter malty toffee and cake mix with gentle spices and hints of chocolate appearing the longer you hold off swallowing. The glossy mouthfeel makes this feel like an everyday luxury. A finish of spent spices cocoa hazelnut and a waft of smoke brings it home."
683,10,"Consummately blended from more than 30 different whiskies this has chewy Highland toffee freshly-baked banana muffins shelled walnuts and faint chocolate orange notes. A smooth full mouthful of blossoming orange thick malt heather honey dabs of espresso and milk chocolate. The malty Horlicks flavors prevail to the end with some attractive shimmering spices. Note the higher strength here though the 45% malt content is consistent across the range."
684,9,"More rounded with greater depth when compared to the 8 year old offering. Not as medicinal and less sweet more toffee and less honey with more dried spice interwoven throughout. The herbs are still there along with licorice root. Dry burning-ember finish. Nicely balanced which makes it my favorite of the three."
685,10,"Imagine your nose hovering inches above well-dried peat then throw in salted nuts brittle toffee and an intensification of vanilla pods. This feels more rounded and balanced than earlier bottlings and is the better for it. Warm sweet caramel juicy orange and lime zest are shot through with peat the rising smoke driving you back while pepper and ginger give close support. The most improved of the Wemyss three but a bit more heft in the composition wouldn’t go amiss. £37"
686,10,"Now listen up class it’s time for your next whisky lesson. Here the educational blend contains 20% very old single malt which delivers a nose of citrus peel honey air-dried ham and some spices in the background. Quite delicious with orange vanilla sponge raisin cremola foam assuaged by plain chocolate and Black Forest gateau. This concoction is further tweaked three ways to complete Reference Series II. A truly great drink in its own right that makes learning fun again. £56"
687,10,"This is bursting with barley sweet oak and all-butter shortbread. There are charcoal sticks too which add a cool smoke note. The taste is like a warm hug on a cold morning; flavors of butter toffee orange poached pear and ginger snaps which combine to keep that deep smoke in balance. The harmony continues into the lengthy finish with flavors of citrus melon and ground ginger."
688,10,"Nutty nose with toasted oak savory peppered meats and traces of wood smoke. It starts off deceptively lightweight with sweet juicy mandarin before a takeover of sharper citrus elements. Honey and gorgeous silky caramels slink by chased by a gentle swish of spice. Light pepperiness with chocolate notes ushers in an aromatic finish. A tasty blend but the nose will not be everyone’s choice."
689,10,"With a bottle shape that makes you want to go bowling this blend has admirable balance between the fruit and the smoke on the nose. The bonfire smoke is matched with aromas of tarte tartin pecan nut red apple and sultana. Smooth and molten in the mouth it has more weight and body than its older brother. There is citrus apples and the late arrival of baked spices cookie dough and mint chocolate on the finish."
690,4,"The last eighteen months have been very good ones for blended and blended malt Scotch whisky. Shackleton and Compass Box set out in a fresh direction and there were top releases from the likes of Johnnie Walker and Blue Hanger. So quality brands from the likes of Grant’s have to rethink. This is well made tasty balanced complex and drinkable without water or a mixer. But shouldn’t a premium whisky justify a strength of 46% ABV? I think so. £50"
691,10,"Wow! A noticeable step up in quality than Ballantine’s Finest (see below) with a perceptibly higher malt content. After Eight mints Rolo toffees spring florals clean and creamy plus some wood combine to produce an appealing nose. One sip confirms that this is gorgeously honeyed layered thick and creamy with heather honey sweet oak and ripe fruits especially orange and mango. The finish is short drying sweet and the only weak spot in an otherwise decent composition."
692,10,"Let me introduce you to infinity blending. 88 casks were blended and married in 88 casks for 6 months then blended with another 88 casks. Half is bottled and half retained at Strathisla’s Royal Salute vault for the next batch. The process is as fascinating as the whisky. Caramel toffee green apple Jaffa orange and vanilla pod aromas. Dark sweetness fresh orange accents: polished juicy and thirst quenching though the brilliance lies in the amaranthine finish. (Global Travel Retail only)"
693,10,"Glentauchers distillery is another Chivas Brothers workhorse located deep in the Speyside countryside. Through the aromas of honey caramel and vanilla peek barley stalks hard pears and hints of Cadbury buttons. The flavor opens sweet with red berries and Parma violets. Although this is intended to follow a lighter style it’s very flavorsome with creamy vanilla poached pear and dried apple. A juicy finish with fruitiness oozing from the cheeks."
694,10,"This second release celebrates Walker’s rare fruit character using 29 handpicked casks combining regional styles aligned to the 2010 Director’s Blend. Aromas of pear and fresh apple layered over tangy sugar-tossed dried fruits pineapple deep orange oils and dry peel. Taciturn smoke. Creamy butteriness with red apple raspberry and sweet orange yields to soft chewy pear skins honey-drizzled Turkish delights and charred paper. An outlier of JW character but important to contemplate how this adds context to the entire collection. £550"
695,9,"One might assume this to be just a smoky version of the standard Famous Grouse (with its honeyed malt bright fruit and floral demeanor). But in addition to the enhanced smoke (which caringly adds a new dimension without smothering the other flavors) there also seems to be more malt body and oak spice in the mix which I think takes Black Grouse to a higher level than Famous Grouse. The grain whisky contributes a “drinkability” component making it a great introduction to smoky whiskies."
696,12,"Sherry cask influence makes itself known through cooked plums chocolate dried figs raisins hazelnuts and sugared almonds on the nose. The palate is also sherry-forward and sweet featuring dried and stewed fruit hazelnut almond dark chocolate and light gingerbread flavors. There’s a youthful heat and the finish wraps up with bitter oak and a wisp of chocolate-covered raisin. Despite the low proof a few drops of water help this hang together more evenly. (Walmart)"
697,12,"Floral and creamy on the nose like meringue perfumed with orange-blossom water. The palate is straightforward: vanilla bubble gum rose petal orange blossom and crème brûlée with a short light finish of toasted almonds and chalky vanilla fudge. (Costco)"
698,4,"This breaks Blue Hanger ranks because it's a traditional blended whisky rather than a blend of just malts. Not that you see the joins. This is a rich powerful clean and crisp whisky with a delightfully balanced flavor of pureed fruits and an unusual almost menthol quality. Smoke wanders in and out to complete the experience. (The Whisky Shop exclusive.)"
699,10,"The youngest age statement Bull in the fold this one has shredded citrus peel fleshy grapefruit candied orange peel and lemon meringue pie. Soft fudge honey tart lemon and buttery pastry with a nip of peppery spice under the tongue complete a satisfying combination. A delicious everyday kind of dram and I preferred this expression’s brightness and attack of the flavors over the 12 year old."
700,10,"Justerini & Brooks sold scotch in the U.S. before Prohibition. This light Speyside-style blend has grassy notes with crystalized lemon slices Bramley apple peel woodsmoke and almonds. Light and sweet on the tongue it unpacks lemon peel satsuma juicy watermelon pepper and aniseed. Grain whisky and herbal notes creep in late and permeate the finish."
701,10,"Stick your snout into aromas of rich tea biscuits honey tangerine toasted almond chips candied pineapple chunks and a prickle of spice. It’s youthful but integrated the grain domineering over the malt. A likable flavor sequence begins with lovely honey sweetness honeydew melon and pear before a citrus phase followed by an ominous wave of spice which vanquishes the sweet fruits leaving a swift spicy finish. (12000 bottles for U.S.)"
702,10,"Behind its comic book label this pallid 3 year old 40% malt content whisky has a nose of vanilla frosting fudge caramel whole lime orange peel fresh apple nougat sesame seed bars and faint notes of ground black pepper This works beautifully in long drinks with its light character of dominant lemon flavors vanilla fizzy sherbet and traces of spice. No messing around: it’s sharp tangy zingy and refreshing. (12000 bottles for U.S.)"
703,4,"This is a sharp dresser with a firm solid mouthfeel and an altogether finer and more focused taste than Shieldaig Classic (see
below). It’s not coastal or earthy particularly either. Instead the flavors are softer and built around mocha smooth creamy toffee and some soft fruit including a touch of overripe banana and melon notes. The savoriness this time comes from a touch of pepper rather than salt."
704,4,"This is like listening to a quiet and understated musician and slowly starting to realize that there are all sorts of clever
nuances just beneath the surface. This evolves from a floral and welcoming nose through a saline note and on to pepper and a Highland earthiness but wrapped up in a rich honeyed body. A nice balance between the ruggedness and sweet softness. All rather pleasant."
705,4,"I had to double check that price. My feelings are well recorded on premium whiskies bottled at 40% and if you were to ask me whether the whisky's worth the price tag the answer's no. That doesn't make it a bad whisky though; far from it. It has a light dusty and fruity nose reminiscent of raspberry sherbet and on the palate there is trademark smoke and pleasant toffee and treacle. Good but in stellar company here. (Travel Retail only) Price is per liter."
706,10,"Overlook the fact that this bottle is saddled with one of the most impenetrable closures known to mankind. Unperturbed this blend flaunts its big toffee aromas whole almond and floral top notes. With light fudge and gentle orange influences it is smooth and rounded top loaded with spice and hazelnut at the front of the mouth. More grain character and roasted spices show through on the finish."
707,10,"This adheres to the rules laid down by blender Keith Law. The nose yields mint toffees cereal notes butterscotch and whole peppercorn. Juicy orange with elements of burnt orange dark toffees and a pleasant balance of sweetness form the palate followed by a wave of peppery spices and late dashes of dates and sultana. The finish has more peppery spice and peppermint. Obey the Law."
708,10,"A toasty and spicier interpretation of an 18 year old blend. Toffee salted pecans Dundee cake and sultana aromas. A beautiful thick texture replete with ripe red fruits cardamom fennel and star anise. Caramels drift past on a river of spice wreathed in a fine layer of smoke then oak mixed nuts and cracker bread. The fruity sweetness is momentary and fleeting leaving the front of the mouth loaded with spice."
709,10,"It begins innocently enough. Ripening strawberries cotton candy and fudge on the nose but with an undertow of devil-may-care spiciness. Soft mandarin citrus vanilla fudge sponge cupcakes and a decent wedge of malt form the core of the palate; the spice is disappointingly mild considering the potential of the first sniff. Sweet and syrupy finish. Still solid enough to make your world better at the end of a hard day."
710,10,"This blend delivers just enough peat turf to live up to the name without alienating the peat phobics. A pleasant nose of chocolate hazelnut pecan nut dried tropical fruits and gentle wood and peat smoke.  Orange toffee banoffee pie Kola Kubes and a little spiciness. Plenty of flavor even if the mouthfeel is a little thin. A short finish with a spicy flare and a few lingering smoky embers. (Total Wine exclusive) Price per 1.75 liter"
711,9,"Delicate yet nicely balanced. Notes of peaches and cream meadow flowers subtle berry fruits soft vanilla and light honey. Gentle pleasing oak finish. Nice dovetailing of flavors and very drinkable. A good example of a lighter-style mature blend and quite the antithesis of the Johnnie Walker Blue Anniversary bottling reviewed above. A pleasing warm weather scotch or perhaps before dinner as an aperitif."
1323,5,"Right up front there’s really rich caramel with a lovely vanilla undertone. Then fruit and lots of it: blackberries blueberries baked apples and canned peaches followed by wood nutmeg and maple syrup. It’s borderline complex with a seamless balance and transition to the flavors. Extraordinarily rich caramel reappears over a medium buttery and satisfying finish."
712,10,"What lies beneath the surface of Dewar’s? Here the blend is finished in virgin and first-fill bourbon casks especially charred then scratched to enable deeper penetration. Thick wedge of vanilla and fudge with oaky accents a dusty mouthfeel pulling in vanilla light lemon milk chocolate and sweet toffee ending on a cocoa powder note. Compared with regular White Label this is less obviously sweet and creamy adds complexity and opens a bourbon connection. Certainly this is up to scratch."
713,10,"This has enticing flavors that will meet with the approval of the regular Grouse drinker: heady florals with fresh peach light honey pecan and underlying caramel. The palate is soothing with vanilla and tangerine hallmarks of Grouse plus rosewater almond and whispering spices. Gently does it that’s the key to this: kick back and relax. This showcases the Midas touch of Gordon Motion’s skills in liquid alchemy. A great value blend to boot. £22"
714,10,"The blended malt in the series is drawn from select aged Highland single malt whiskies chosen by Stewart Laing. A luxuriant nose of rich runny caramels deliciously malty and balanced with notes of dried apple mixed peel and pecan shells layered over warm spice. Smooth with a light to medium body showing toffee apple raisin and caramel tasting fatter with time and yielding pineapple notes. A finish of soft sucked toffees and tingly spices. A top-class well-executed drink."
715,10,"The sixth incarnation of Master of Malt’s cult blend of closed distillery whiskies contains Port Ellen Brora Mosstowie Glenisla Imperial Caperdonich and Glen Mhor with grain whisky from Port Dundas. Apples and sugar browning in a pan smooth driftwood and dairy fudge but with the Glenisla it’s noticeably smokier than earlier batches. Sweet blancmange initially before it soars to a tangy spicy peak; the peat smoke backed by white pepper ground ginger peanuts and florentines. Smokin’ liquid history. (534 bottles) £350"
716,10,"A new oloroso-forward Chivas positioned to split between the 12 and 18 year olds? I got this. Refined and inviting nose of lemon pith black fruits and Kola Kubes. The velvety texture is wonderfully smooth redolent of an apricot custard Danish lime zest raisin currant mixed peel and walnut with a growing bitter-lemon note. Quite unique finish like sucking on lumpy Spanish lemons speckled with spices. (LA NY Miami Chicago Northern California but will go national)"
717,10,"A pale primrose of a dram. Waxed lemon salted butter pats white peach honey and the wood smoke from green stems. A sip brings Highland toffee honey chocolate fudge rich tart fruits with dried apple raisin mixed peel and a late appearance of malt pepper and smoke. It wraps up with a glossy clingy finish but it’s short. Experimenting with water nudges peanut brittle pralines and fudge to the surface. Overall a very decent drop."
718,10,"Banana chips peppercorn coriander stalks dry grasses cracker bread faint lemon zest butterscotch and green apple; more grain than malt character evident. With watery citrus butterscotch walnut lemon peel and caramel initially it’s lighter-bodied but balanced. It develops more spices and a fine texture as it dilutes lifted by cinnamon caramel and gentle spices. Overlook the hard-to-love nose and this is tasty both neat and over ice."
719,10,"Buttercream fresh-cut bread taffy candy citrus and a distinctive hoppy note from the craft ale casks. Charmingly smooth but quite light bodied there is warmed bramble fruit bitter grapefruit peel and plenty of peppery spice. This stands up well to other ale-cask finished whiskies but in the Grant’s range there are better whiskies with more to offer."
720,4,"One of two blended whiskies vying to be the official next Great King Street release this is the peated version and it's gustier than the original with less citrus and more peat. Indeed it's impressively full-flavored with peat in the driving seat and ginger cake lime and dark chocolate biscuits and pepper in the mix. Best of all unlike far too many Scotch whiskies this year it doesn't use peat to hide immature spirit. £30"
721,10,"Vanilla laced with spice fondant icing grapefruit peel and lime zest leave the vanilla and floral notes lower down the pecking order. In the mouth grapefruit and orange dominate the vanilla yet the mouthfeel is thinner and the acidity tips toward the taste of bitter orange seeds. A lingering bitter orange finish."
722,10,"Honey fudge a little melon and white grape dry roasted spices and peppercorn but noticeably less fruit than the age-statement varieties. The palate has pulpy white melon lemon lime and some grapefruit acidity before sweetening with honey. Quite tart at times some peppery spice collaborates before the vanilla cream and green fruits take charge. A clean juicy finish of lemon zest and mild spices coats the throat."
723,10,"Master of Malt has accumulated quite a trophy cabinet for their work on blends. The nose is inviting with butter toffee Bramley apples fennel seeds cut lawns and chocolate-covered oat biscuits. It’s a pretty smooth proposition serving up caramel maltiness stewed apple and orange and grapefruit pith with just a hint of sharp lemon freshness to open up with. The ginger finish is zappy but short. A solid everyday blend."
724,10,"Thick viscous golden syrup digestive biscuits and Almond Joy bars underpin some soft peaty aromas. It’s rather an appealing combination. Satin smooth on the tongue with lemon lime orange and dried pineapple but enough malt to keep things interesting. The finish riffs on a ripe lemon theme accompanied by spicy stardust. For the few extra bucks the more mature component whiskies make for a richer fuller and more satisfying experience than The Antiquary’s red-labeled bottle."
725,9,"Deeper and darker when compared to its younger siblings but with the same personality. Drier especially on the finish with added oak resin espresso leather and tobacco. Bonus points for character."
726,9,"Good weight to this blend. Creamy and mouth-coating on the palate with a nice malty honey-tinged backbone. Bright fruitabounds with golden raisin lemon meringue peach and a hint of pineapple. Notes of creamy vanilla and gently nutty through to its soft finish."
727,10,"How does this long-established blend shape up on its own without a ginger or soda mixer? Fresh apple juice a twist of lemon dried orange peel peppercorn cracker bread and a vegetal spicy note. It gets into its stride with delicious apple gentle fudge and good-tempered spices with cracked black pepper and a little sourness to finish. Mild agreeably smooth without any bombast or hullabaloo; it just blends in."
728,7,"An odd non-age stated blend that uses a solera system to get a drop of the original 1958 blend into the mix. The blend is then finished for four years in oloroso casks. It's a bit of blending gymnastics. Very sherry influenced with marionberry jam malt salt and oak. The integration and flavors are nice but it all feels a bit muted. A medium length and dry finish shows off some of the younger spirit in the mix. (U.S. only)"
3721,6,"The nose features peat ozone malt sherry mango charcuterie and an herbal note. Overt sherry and rum on the palate with pineapple caramel worn leather and bonfire smoke. The finish is long and earthy with chocolate and spicy oak. (160 bottles for U.S.)"
729,9,"The second generation of The Spice Tree. (This new expression sports a much larger tree image on the front label.) While the first bottling used inner French oak staves to impart additional oak influence this one uses French oak barrel heads. This new bottling is also bolder displaying more oak -- there are more dried spice notes and it’s more viscous and clinging on the palate. (It’s also less elegant than the original bottling.) Notes of sticky toffee vanilla fudge bramble and red currant give way to oak resin cinnamon clove nutmeg and subtle lemongrass. A tactile somewhat resinous polished leather finish wraps it up. A nice whisky but I really enjoy the subtler more elegant nature of the original bottling better."
730,10,"Master blender Graham Coull hand-selected a variety of aged stock and cask types for this new global addition to the Label 5 range. Vanilla dark fruit and gentle spices on the nose but the appeal lies in the beautiful clingy mouthfeel. Warm marmalade nuts and oak flavors with whispers of cinnamon and clove combine to produce a creamy smooth dram. It builds and builds but never feels like it fully arrives. The finish is drying with dampened-down spices. €40"
731,10,"With whiskies aged for 5 years in bourbon barrels this has a pleasant nose of dark toffee vanilla toasted whole grain bread and light spices. The mouthfeel is a bit flabby; chocolate and toasted spices especially cinnamon and pepper are quelled by malty caramel baked orange and touches of old leather. The finish is dry malty and slightly nutty with a hollow core of spices. A bit dour overall."
732,4,"A very different whisky to its unaged namesake and most unlike any of the other blends tasted for this issue. That’s no bad thing.
This is less sweet than most blends with tobacco leaf and ashtray to the fore and a dusty grainy note with a touch of oak grape skin and sweet heather. That said not a lot of evidence of the 12 years in cask."
733,10,"This blend has been a Whyte and MacKay whisky for 25 years. The nose has spice toffee wheat biscuits and smoke but the combination feels a little benign. The palate is jammy lightweight and middle-of-the-road. With a backbone of grain there are flavors of graham cracker chocolate ganache well-baked fruitcake banoffee pie smoke and dried peels with a burst of spices on the finish."
734,10,"It’s Double Wood Jim but not as we know it. Here the blend has been given a Madeira finish presenting an appealing nose of spun sugar golden raisins cinnamon nutmeg and hazelnut. The blend has a creamy texture with good weight to carry the flavors of orange peel mango and dried pineapple leading to a zesty spark on swallowing. Wood spices nuttiness and lingering toffee make for a satisfying finish. The extra Madeira maturation is understated and perfectly judged."
735,12,"Earthy with corn husk and biscuit dough on the nose along with cooked apples white pepper and a light spice. Honey almond meal toasted marshmallow and a hint of lemon make for a simple somewhat grainy palate. It finishes short and sweet with some cinnamon heat. (Costco)"
736,10,"Brian Kinsman’s new creation was inspired by their founder William Grant with a remit to create a malty blend of character. Digestive biscuits malt honeycomb and confectioner’s chocolate melted over a bain-marie. It’s a satisfyingly rich dram well-structured with a great mouthfeel that wanes with natural dilution. Banoffee pie caramel biscuits and maltiness deepen to flavors of coffee bean and molasses leaving a teeth-coating finish of black coffee. (UK and France only) £18"
737,12,"The nose is grassy and light with some youthful heat orange blossom vanilla coconut and cedar. A clean palate of lemon orange vanilla banana and toasted coconut leads into a simple finish of oak and more vanilla. Basic but well balanced. (Total Wine & More)"
738,4,"How can you really compare this to a quality blend priced under $50? It's hard not to view this as a victory of style over substance and I object to premium whiskies being just 40% ABV but nevertheless this is excellently made and the blending of whiskies over 21 years is exemplary. It's rich and viscous with light peach and plum notes and a pleasant earthy base."
739,10,"At this age there are more linear displays of fruit and sweetness than the 8 year old. Behind the tarte tatin butterscotch light pepper and wood spice is a green verdant nose of wet foliage and public lawns in the morning mist. It has a light to medium-weight texture of sugary butterscotch strawberry and raspberry developing around an oak and malt core. When the fruit flavor withers there is a drop off in flavor leaving a malty melee. £48"
740,4,"Master of Malt is an online whisky company that seems to try its hand at most things and is bringing a fresh irreverence to the world of whisky. This was created in partnership with the bass guitarist of British rock band Athlete and it's rather good. Sweet and rich with toffee orange chocolate and honey it's another blend with a lot to say for itself.  £55"
741,9,"What a surprise! Really thick and malty for a blend (there’s a high malt content here for sure) and also nicely mature for 8 years old. Great balance too with the island aggressiveness tamed by a rich malty elegance. Delicious honey toasted oak firm peat dark chocolate and glazed citrus meld nicely with the malt leading to a honeyed lightly-peppered finish. Very enjoyable."
742,10,"A solid presence in the range the strength and malt content continue to mark these out over their contemporaries. Grapefruit peels sliced juicy orange and lemon butter icing on the nose. The palate is thinner than others in the range with crystallized orange fudge plus cardamom and mild pepper. The finish of sugared satsumas is boosted by a long lasting trail of spices."
743,10,"The eldest son of the 5th earl of Wemyss Lord Elcho was supportive to the Young Pretender. Proportionally more sherry at play here. Plum skin chunky raisins blackcurrant and fainter sweetened cocoa and coffee bean notes. The palate is a little hollow at first then proffers barley sugar rich shortbread baked apple linseed and toffee though the flavor development plateaus. Water picks out sweet clementine notes. Given the choice of expressions I prefer the vibrancy of the Young(er) Pretender. £26"
744,4,"In terms of bang for your buck this has always been one of the very best blends punching well above its weight. Whether you feel the same about this revamped version depends on how much you want a peat punch. Previously rough and gutsy this is softer with more licorice and treacle but also more younger sappiness. Smoke has the last say but it's like an aging sportsman replacing energy and attitude with guile and subtlety."
745,10,"A spicier character to represent 1920s Bombay (now Mumbai) yields an intriguing nose of cumin dried apple cardamom and roasted coriander seed walnut shells dry meat from the tandoor and aged cigars in Spanish cedar. A rather gluey texture with a dominant cinnamon note interjected by spicy fruit from the European oak and gentle cloves. A short finish leaves a reverberation of spices and chicory root. The aromas are wonderful but it comes unstuck with the mouthfeel. £75"
746,10,"This batch of 1420 bottles was created with slightly older malts a 16 year old grain from a refill hogshead and a 14 year old Lowland malt disgorged from an Islay cask. Sugar mice dried hay sharpened pencils hints of lemon with subtle smoke like the burning of a distant stubble field. Sweet cereal notes black pepper and ginger parkin build to a conclusion of Brazil nut mocha and chocolate ganache. (UK & Netherlands only) £45"
747,9,"A blend of three different single malts. Its name derives from the fact that the whisky is aged in American oak bodies with French Oak heads (a cross of both oaks). There’s no age statement but the whiskies are all older than ten years. This is a gentle subtly complex somewhat lithe easy drinking whisky (and with less oak spice than its predecessor The Spice Tree). People think whisky is an after-dinner drink but I think this would make a great aperitif because of its delicate dry spice notes and light body. I’m picking up evenly-proportioned notes of vanilla and coconut with more subtle notes of clove anise and delicate fruit all wrapped up in a gentle malty body. A very versatile whisky."
748,10,"Hunter Laing blended this grand Highland whisky: an 85% malt-driven recipe of more mature stock. I liked its aromas of dripping caramels dry peats soft hay and faint pepper balancing the resilient smoky character. There’s the juiciness of mandarin oranges too. The blend is smooth and well-textured beginning with sugared orange malt vanilla and toasted spices which glide into clove and black pepper. The drying finish has spicy pepper ground ginger and lasting citrus."
749,10,"Slabs of plain chocolate Kendal mint cake vanilla essence and malt with a dry dusty character makes this suggest itself for an after-dinner occasion. The palate is very sweet; sugarplum caramelized brown sugar flapjacks bramble and pink rhubarb before it finally coagulates into a thick Horlicks maltiness. There’s an impressive trajectory of flavor here though the mouthfeel is nothing special and dilution doesn’t enhance it to any real degree. Dry and malty finish."
750,10,"Molten blossom honey almond milk puddings and Parma violets interlaced with a fine drifting chimney smoke compose the nose of this new blend from William Grant & Sons. Smooth burnished orange and honey cough drops initially then the flavor develops through more pronounced citrus and gentle spices to achieve a sweeter climax. The grain is quite evident in the harmony of the blend. The finish is long more beeswax than honey the sweetness finally depleted. (Travel Retail only) £20"
751,4,"The Famous Grouse has been extended in various directions with varying degrees of success but for my money this is the best and most logical. This is the version where the smoky oily spicy and peaty notes of the original blend are brought more to the fore but this works because married to it are grape and melon notes that ensure the Grouse lands softly."
752,9,"Floral aroma with a lively array of orchard fruit and citrus.  Underlying notes of soft honey and vanilla.  Good malt foundation for a blend.  An elegant and breezy ""anytime"" dram."
753,4,"Described as “an exotic mix of bananas mango pitaya pineapples guava passion fruit and raisins all balanced perfectly by deep charred peaty notes.” It sort of is but this isn't a soft silky smooth dessert whisky; it's Rod Stewart singing Air Supply's “All Out Of Love.” It's soft and gentle but the gravel may put off the softies and it's far too bland to appeal to fans of Maggie May. Between a rock and a hard place."
754,10,"This is the foundation stone of the whole Label 5 range and it’s a solid reputable blend that works neat with a rock of ice or in cocktails. The digestive biscuits dark walnut toffee and fruit salad aromas concede to a rather inauspicious palate of burnt orange malt biscuits charred oak and ground ginger. It’s lively through to its malt and spice conclusion."
755,4,"In blended whisky terms this isn’t for the faint-hearted and joins a number of recent releases prepared to show off its
darker grittier side. It’s a big flavored blend with its heart in the islands and with oily coastal notes reminiscent of a delicatessen: brine salty cheese some crab apple relish and smoked fish. It’s a rugged bruiser but it makes its mark with some style."
756,4,"Standard blends fall into two categories: those that will behave nicely when mixed to offer almost non-whisky experience and those that are feistier and want to make sure you know they’re there. This is the former and with whiskies like this one it’s possible to blink and miss it. That doesn’t make it bad; just indistinctive and unexceptional. There is little sign of the wood here but the delicate sweet apricot notes just do enough."
757,10,"Naming your blend “Sherry Cask” retains an air of ambiguity to it. Theoretically it could be the maturation or finishing vessel for all or some of the constituents. The whisky is light-bodied and the sweet sherry is evident though a nip of bitterness interrupts. Smoother on the palate than the 12 year old there’s strawberry raspberry and background spice with a blackberry note late in the finish. Overall there’s less flavor development but it’s an old-school kind of blend."
758,10,"America Walker wants your cocktails. Emma Walker that is the blender whose signature adorns the first of these experimental expressions. Toffee Speyside nose digestive biscuits cinnamon cool mint and a pronounced grain note from Port Dundas. Orange lime peel lovely caramel richness and creamy toffee through dilution. The brand’s second consecutive rye cask finish: you noticed too? Up against its sibling JW Select Rye Cask there are certain similarities but this is fruitier less intricate and less rich and spicy."
759,10,"This blend is generously half malt and half grain unusually selecting 16-18 year old malts. The result has a nose of rich honey and florals resplendent in a citrus intensity: squeezed orange skin with a background note of dry crackers. The palate is orange and malty with cola faint spices and a little waxiness but the core feels a little hollow. A good length finish where the pleasant buzz has a slight peatiness rubbed in. A decent stand-up dram."
760,9,"Quite fragrant and fairly sweet (but not cloyingly so) rich with nutty toffee nougat and bright summer fruits. Clean gently sweet finish. Well rounded nicely matured for its age and at $30 a good value these days. A versatile whisky to keep in the drinks cabinet; it’s enjoyable enough sipping neat or with a splash of water but (at this price) you won’t cringe if your guests drink it on the rocks or use it as a mixer."
761,10,"Batch 1 of this new blend brings oxidized apple maple syrup crispy potato skins soft spices and nutmeg grated over eggnog. Rich strands of citrus mint and raisins mingle building in intensity to greater spiciness at the swallow where ginger and burnt sugar emerges. Undiluted there is a hot spicy slightly acrid finish dominated by the ginger. Water adds melon mandarin and apple and manages to keep the ginger in check. £40"
4450,6,"As with most of the Tomintoul range the nose is quiet with diluted orange juice and fondant cream in time. The fruity palate majors in canned peaches in cream with encroaching nuttiness and white pepper. Fruit remains a feature in the medium-length finish with cocoa and malt."
762,10,"Delicate nose of sherbet and melting heather honey layered over pleasant grassy and herbal notes. The texture is sweet thin and syrupy with a slight vegetal note before salted caramel reels it in brimming over into a briny finish like a salty kiss. The grain clearly plays a major role. Truth be told the aromas and flavors work well but the lack of weight makes it feel like a tiddler rather than catch of the day. (Selected U.S. states NZ Switzerland)."
763,10,"Aromas of liquid honey light toffee dried apple and satsuma peel. There is an initial citric attack but when the flare dies down a residual bitterness cuts through the underlying creaminess and caramel. Sure its component whiskies lack substance and grip but there is some flavor progression through to an enjoyable piquancy around the gums. The finish is a nippy buzz of peel and heather honey. Simple uncomplicated but for the price there’s plenty to like here."
764,4,"From the perfumed nose to the sweet and short finish this blend doesn’t really put a foot wrong but it’s shy and unadventurous.
Clearly well made well balanced and quite acceptable it has a perfumed black currant sherbet nose some slight but enjoyable blueberry grape and prune notes and a soft sweet conclusion. On its own all fine: but it gets lost when in company."
765,4,"Douglas Laing follows up its award winning Islay-soaked Big Peat with this a sherried Speyside whisky. Just as Big Peat looks like Captain Haddock from Tintin Scallywag on the label is a dead ringer for Snowy though the official story is different. Anyway this whisky isn't a patch on the Islay monster. Rootsy green salad malt is only partially rescued by the trademark Christmas cake and stewed fruits. Likeable but not a classic. £45"
766,10,"A pleasant nose of light caramel dried orange rind butterscotch sweet grain and a lick of bonfire smoke yet it’s like the volume has been dialed down to three. Delicate to the point of shyness. Sweet barley concentrated orange a low rumble of spice and the grain sings through. Accessible well structured and light-textured leading to a finish of brown sugar around the gums although it has a stronger grain character than many in its price range."
767,10,"A light oily nose a little nutty baked apple cinnamon nutmeg and malt biscuits. There are seductive dark spices and cooked fruit almost savory like lifting the lid on a tagine. A thinner mouthfeel showing some lime zest before a warm enveloping glow of malt sweetness gentle spice toffee raisin and char emerges. Savory peppery finish. Like nightfall it gets darker the longer you contemplate it. With water sweeter with more candied citrus as honeys materialize."
768,10,"At 8 years old there are stiff caramels malt oatcakes Genoise sponge and zested clementines on the nose. It doesn’t stint on flavor when it comes to the taste bringing dried fig rolls chewy toffee Aunt Sally pralines walnuts and chocolate ganache to the party. It’s driven by dry fruit rather than sweetness and there is a bitter edge to the swallow that persists into the finish. £35"
769,10,"This venerable blend has a nose of mandarin syrup cake vanilla cream and cut hay with chopped cilantro and other herbal top notes. Sweet and fruity though verging on tasting of artificial sweeteners at times there are malt notes and a developing butteriness with sweet mandarin notes and sponge cake. It all hangs on a light structure but it’s less smooth on the finish with a scratch of wood smoke."
770,10,"MacQueen’s has an impressive range of age statement blends but this is the youngest one. Faint caramel and toast a mild rub of whole spice and snuff tobacco. The mouthfeel is meager and lacks any real punch; there is spice and fudge but little sweetness. More caramel flavors develop alongside chocolate notes before a dry quick finish. There are better options around even at this price."
771,10,"You’re familiar with those generic blended Scotch whiskies of debatable origin with an inoffensive flavor profile right? This isn’t one of those. With aromas of the fruit and foliage of an orange grove beeswax and a grassy note this is a juicy citrus-led dram that puffs out in the mouth bringing a tingle of light pepper ginger and thick fudge. Despite the thinner mouthfeel the baked orange and bitter Seville orange on the finish give it some bite. Perfectly serviceable."
772,9,"The nice thing about Islay whiskies is that they often show their true nature better at a younger age. Malty sweet and incredibly herbal (almost gin-like) with emerging tar smoked seaweed and olive. Medicinal in nature with lingering tar and brine on the finish. Fairly straight-forward (what do you expect for 8 years old?) but a pretty decent showing for a whisky this young."
773,10,"What does this say about how far whisky has come? We live in an era where you can now buy the official whisky from a major motion picture. This has a deep amber color. Really deep. The nose brings warm muffins caramel and grassy notes with a good dose of smoke. It’s a sweet concoction with a peppery kick. There’s a tinge of polypropylene before a short clipped spicy finish. It just needs to find more of its own identity."
774,10,"Meaning “son of the sea” this MacNaMara has a lilting sweetness that lifts from the glass the characteristic orange-peel oil note is present but less assertive. Nectarine Murray mints and antique shop mustiness but a lot less aromatic than many of its contemporaries. Flavors of sweet melon golden honey and tangy orange take off in the mouth with tastes of white pepper fennel and ground ginger in hot pursuit. Pepperiness penetrates an otherwise juicy finish."
775,10,"The range begins with this entry-level whisky aged for 3 years. Aromas of pale toffee vanilla and scented herbaceous notes can be found on the nose. It has a light silky texture and comprises flavors of stewed fruits with a slight bitterness behind them. Plum and coffee notes expand though it remains tart through to the buzzy finish which is lifted by hints of chocolate. A robust and pugnacious dram."
776,10,"This Highland blend has a nose of lemon peel tangerine and pine-scented kitchen surfaces. The whisky is young with a sweet mandarin dressing over the grain character barley sugars and a gentle rumble of spice. What it lacks at this age is mouthfeel structure and wood influence. The finish continues the sugared orange theme with spice and ground pepper fading to soor plooms. For what can be expected at this age the Clansman does its job well."
777,10,"Robert McNish conceived his recipe for a lighter style of Highland whisky in Glasgow in 1863 (though the brand added an ‘a’ to his surname for easier pronunciation). Whole orange ground hazelnut and ground ginger on the nose though it keeps pretty tight-lipped. Light and sweet in the mouth with mandarin and more pronounced ginger mid-palate before a medium-length finish of bubblegum and gooseberry. It just seems a little uninspiring given the special occasion."
897,9,"I really enjoy these older Eagle Rare whiskeys. They’re big hearty whiskies that are very traditional in style but have extra depth on the palate due to the extensive aging. Sweet notes (candy corn and toffee) meld nicely with underlying nuttiness (pecans almonds) delicate spice (vanilla cinnamon mint) and a hint of leather. One of the best Eagle Rares I have ever tasted."
778,10,"Auchnagie (1812–1911) was a southern Highland distillery that existed for close to a century near Balluinluig south of Pitlochry. This reanimation is pale yellow in color with an abundance of young green herbal and foliage notes with summer ferns cardamom pods and green tea. It has an ethereal gossamer-like texture with green apple melon boats and soft honey. As the layers peel away the sweetness is dabbed with spices and black pepper before it peters out."
779,10,"This amber-colored blend from the Gaelic Whisky Company has sweet barley notes and gentle spice aromas. The caramels prop up the dominant flavor of cold-pressed orange oil squeezed from the peel. A crescendo of peppery spice marks the late phase and distinguishes the swallow before a finish of tangy citrus peel with a touch of clove. Perfectly straightforward blend but limited in scope like a linear dot-to-dot connecting barley orange peel and spice."
780,9,"A marriage of 13 and 18 year old bourbons. A mature yet very elegant whiskey with a silky texture and so easy to embrace with a splash of water. Balanced notes of honeyed vanilla soft caramel a basket of complex orchard fruit blackberry papaya and a dusting of cocoa and nutmeg; smooth finish. Sophisticated stylish with well-defined flavors. A classic!"
781,9,"This bottling celebrates master distiller Parker Beam's 50 years of service by including whiskey from each of the past five decades. This is a fabulous whiskey: seamless and incredibly complex with an impeccable marriage of youth and maturity. It’s also very even-keeled throughout -- quite different than last year’s equally impressive PHC a 27 year old whose personality was more like an exhilarating old wooden rollercoaster ride (and also brandished more oak). Look for candied citrus nectarine blueberry and sultana anchored by a nougat center laced with honeyed vanilla and orange creamsicle. There’s a dusting of cocoa powder brittle mint and cinnamon too. Tobacco leaves polished leather and teasing bourbon barrel char round out the palate emerging more prominently towards a warming finish. A classic!"
782,9,"A wheated bourbon from the old Stitzel-Weller distillery. A gentle richly-textured whiskey loaded with fruit and spice. Black raspberry jam caramel apple and papaya along with warming cinnamon and subtle teaberry on nutty toffee nougat and creamy vanilla. Spicy polished oak finish. Superbly balanced sophisticated and very drinkable. An outstanding whiskey!"
783,9,"A marriage of four different bourbons ranging from 11 to 17 years old. This to me is benchmark Four Roses: subtly complex vibrant yet fully matured with well-defined flavors of bramble dry citrus soft creamy vanilla caramel marzipan allspice a hint of cinnamon and subtle cedar-aged cigar tobacco.  Soft clean polished oak finish. A very versatile bourbon! Your decision shouldn’t be whether to buy it but rather how much water to add."
784,9,"This whiskey has improved greatly over the past two years. (I thought that the 2007 release was almost too easy-going as some wheated bourbons can be.) A little more oak spice has added balance complexity and depth. Very clean on the palate. Layered sweetness (toffee caramel maples syrup elegant rum) provide a foundation for warming cinnamon bramble blueberry tart sultana light candy corn herbal tea and subtle marzipan. A soft dry polished oak finish ropes in all the sweetness keeping me wanting more. Excellent!"
785,9,"Another excellent Stagg and considering its alcohol level it’s also a good value if you can get it at this price. Notes of toffee pot still rum nougat dates tobacco roasted nuts polished oak and leather. Great depth and nicely balanced. A masculine bourbon of character and structure."
786,9,"Unlike the standard “small batch” releases this is from a single barrel: a really good single barrel. I rated the 18 year old small batch a 93 in the last issue and I like this one even better. There’s less wood getting in the way. It’s softer more elegant. Lovely fruit gently sweet (black raspberry jam blueberry pie) with nougat creamy vanilla a sprinkling of cinnamon and polished leather on the finish. And so drinkable. Classic stuff!"
787,9,"A crisp robust very dynamic bourbon. Amber-orange marmalade color. Spicy with notes of cinnamon spearmint and Earl Grey tea. The spice is balanced nicely by thick toffee rhum agricole caramel apple and bright citrus with a polished leather finish. There have been some great Birthday Bourbons but I think this is the best one to date. A whiskey deserving classic status."
788,5,"A caramel-laden fruit bouquet followed by unending vanilla leather tobacco cotton candy marshmallow quince cinnamon hints of juniper and wildflowers. Then brown sugar butter and maple syrup over buttermilk pancakes Cracker Jack raw honey bittersweet chocolate and hints of pecan shell. Extremely long finish with a fried apple pie note. An incredibly complex and intense must-have sipper. Perfection."
789,8,"Tilled earth tobacco and leather meet clover honey maple syrup and pecan pie sweetness. It pours broad and mouth-coating across the palate with a lovely softness and pervasive vanilla and apple sweetness gently tugged at by oaky tannins and more tobacco leaf. A touch floral and gently spiced with cinnamon leading the way. Overall this exudes beautiful balance right through the long finish that resonates both prettily and powerfully with dried citrus. Collectible"
790,9,"The complete package: uncut unfiltered full-flavored richly textured (almost chewy) and very complex. Notes of toffee-coated nuts vanilla fudge polished leather cedar-tinged tobacco barrel char cocoa powder and a hint of fig wrapped up with a firm oak grip on the finish. Worth every penny of the premium price being charged for this commemorative release. Editor's Choice."
791,9,"Sometime recently the source of this whiskey changed from the now defunct Stitzel-Weller distillery to Buffalo Trace. No matter. This whiskey is still the best of the Van Winkle line. It’s crisp clean vibrant impeccably balanced and nicely matured. Complex fruit (bramble candied citrus) caramel coconut custard maple syrup fresh spice (vanilla warming cinnamon nutmeg a dusting of cocoa powder) on a bed of nougat. Outstanding! (Editor's Choice)"
792,9,"Distilled at the now legendary Stitzel-Weller distillery. Rich aromas of vanilla toffee marzipan cocoa nutmeg and cinnamon. Similar follow-through on the palate with black raspberry maple syrup teaberry and dusty dried corn thrown into the mix. Warming cinnamon and polished oak on the finish. The sweet notes balance and integrate nicely with the oak. An exemplary rendition of an ultra-aged wheated bourbon. Price is per 375 ml. Editor's Choice."
818,12,"Lush rich and deep from the start with blackberry cherry spiced plum cinnamon mint and maple syrup aromas. Even more density on the palate which has deep flavors of cocoa powder Raisinets roasted walnuts cinnamon mint maple syrup and chewy oak. Extraordinary length on the finish which carries the chocolate dark fruit spice mint and rich oak notes for minutes. A phenomenal follow-up to its 13 year old antecedent our 2019 Whisky of the Year."
793,9,"Very well-balanced and mellow on the nose and palate.  Sweet notes of mature dark rum toffee nougat and candy corn dovetail with dried apricot golden raisin hot cinnamon soft mint tea and vanilla.  Polished leather and tobacco leaves on a long contemplative finish.  This is what ultra-mature bourbon should taste like: all the depth and complexity that comes with this much aging without all the excessive oak.  The wood is there but it never crosses the line.  The next closest Heaven Hill bourbon in age is the Evan Williams 23 year old for the export market.  There's no comparison.  The Evan Williams 23 year old is way past its prime.  This Parker's Heritage Collection has it easily beat.  In fact this Parker's shows less oak and lethargy on the finish than the 129.6 proof expression of last year's inaugural 1996 vintage Parker's Heritage Collection a whisky less than half its age.  (There were three different expressions and I thought the other two were outstanding).
Parker Beam chose these whiskeys from the third floor of Warehouse U.  Given that the whiskeys were low in the warehouse the average summer high temperatures were 6-10 degrees cooler than the top floor; helping to slow the aging process and the oak influence."
794,9,"No age statement but distilled in 1998. A beautiful expression of Stagg and a lot of bourbon for your buck. Easy to drink with the addition of water showing caramel nougat dates dark chocolate polished oak along with a hint of leather and tobacco. Slightly better than last year’s release—richer thicker and more balanced. I’m enjoying Stagg’s more rounded less aggressive demeanor of late. A classic! Editor's Choice."
795,9,"My review of this whiskey a few years back indicated that it was too woody and past its prime to be a great whiskey. This one is better. (Yes bottlings do change.) There’s more balance and the oak is in check. It’s still big and brooding with notes of toffee roasted nuts dried spice (cinnamon rosemary evergreen needles) candied fruit cocoa and polished oak. Tobacco and toffee on the finish with lingering dried spices and there’s a nice foundation of sweetness to balance all the oak and spice."
796,9,"From one barrel and only sold in one location but well worth the effort to procure a bottle. Nutty toffee pecan pie apricot berried jam and nougat peppered with cinnamon mint cocoa and tobacco. Warming with polished leather and dried spice on the finish. Seamless richly textured and impeccably balanced. (Exclusive to the Bourbon Heritage Center at the Heaven Hill distillery in Bardstown KY.)"
797,9,"Very similar to last year’s release. (A good thing since it was wonderful!) Very smooth with layered sweetness (toffee fig cake nougat maple syrup) dark fruit (black raspberry blueberry) cinnamon and polished oak on the finish. A whisky of elegance and sophistication. (Editor's Choice)"
798,12,"This is mature whiskey at its most refined: a balance of fruits nuts sweetness and restrained oak. The nose has it all: salted buttered pecans rock candy Dr. Pepper blackberry jam dried blueberries caramel corn tobacco barn and old leather chair. It’s practically dessert-like in the mouth with dark chocolate-covered caramel candied pecans Goo Goo Clusters cherry cola blackberry and blueberry jam and a kiss of white pepper. The finish stays consistent a mouthwatering mélange of caramel chocolate and nuts. Harmonious seamless and silky—you’d never guess the proof."
799,2,"A glass of this whiskey starts with a fragrant nose of honey blossom wild strawberries vanilla custard and a dusting of cocoa powder. The palate is a complex mélange of cherries blueberries blackberries mango and orange marrying with dark chocolate baking spice lush oak aged tobacco leaf and a light espresso note. More richness and complexity on a delicious finish of chocolate blackberry jam walnuts and coconut shavings."
800,9,"Very mellow silky in texture and on the sweet side for mature bourbon. It’s not bold like Parker’s Heritage Collection 27 year old which has much more oak spice and resin. Willett’s foundation of molasses and toffee is accentuated by candied fruit fig dusty corn and tobacco with mint tea cinnamon and vanilla peppered throughout. It’s perilously drinkable. I am impressed how these 20-plus year old Willett rye and bourbon whiskeys maintain their balance and keep the oak in check. Splendid ultra-mature bourbon. (Less than 100 bottles of this were sent to California and not all the same barrel. Happy hunting.)"
801,9,"Aged 11 years this year’s single barrel release is a lively mix of caramel and bright zingy orange on palate entry. Cinnamon vanilla and mint emerge mid-palate leading to polished oak baked apple and a hint of leather on the finish. A lively bourbon with crisp clean flavors and nicely balanced. Another winner from Four Roses."
802,2,"Bakery notes orange blossom allspice dark berries raspberry preserves butterscotch chocolate leather and cedar chest integrate superbly on the nose. The show continues on a very full-bodied palate packed with dark fruit orange slices brown sugar almond cinnamon and an overlay of allspice. A deliciously thick viscous finish goes on and on completing this tour de force with flavors of chocolate-covered marshmallows cinnamon more allspice old leather tobacco and polished oak."
803,12,"Intensely fruity to start with dark cherries blackberries and raspberry coulis; there’s also dark chocolate maple syrup leather book bindings and oolong tea set over a background of baking spice. With water brown sugar creeps in at the outer edges. Remarkable complexity on the palate: cooked dark fruit dark chocolate ganache tea leaf roasted pecans maple syrup licorice tobacco and well-integrated spice. The flavor array is seemingly endless and carries well into a lengthy warming finish."
804,12,"A complex nose of leather cedar chest black tea cooked cherries rich spice and polished oak; water brings out bright citrus green apple candy and blackberry cobbler filling. Dark chocolate cooked cherry fresh ginger licorice black pepper and nuts on the palate; spearmint licorice and tobacco appear once water is added. Extremely lengthy finish with licorice tea caramel dark chocolate polished oak and spearmint. You might want to tough it out at barrel proof but water benefits this whiskey and saves your taste buds."
805,9,"Distilled in 1986. An excellent old wheated bourbon. Soothing oily texture with notes of toffee old rum nougat vanilla bean candied fruit black raspberry corn bread hints of Earl Grey tea cinnamon and nutmeg with a smooth polished oak finish. I recently reviewed a Pappy Van Winkle Family Reserve 23 year old (bottle #B1986) at 47.8% which I also thought was outstanding with a comparable flavor profile (although some earlier bottlings I tasted years ago were heavy on the oak) and it was priced at $220. Given this you need to ask yourself if you want to pay the extra $130 or so for the higher strength special decanter pair of glasses and wood box that comes with this new ORVW Family Selection. Or not."
852,9,"Thicker beefier and more decadent than the 61.3% bottling but not as crisp. Less of the summer fruits and more of the chewy toffee. Another fine effort!"
806,9,"Very elegant bright and silky smooth with honey-kissed summer fruits subtle tropical fruit (papaya coconut pineapple) gentle caramel sweet corn and soothing vanilla along with a dusting of cinnamon nutmeg and crisp mint. Pleasing gently spicy finish. The most impressive aspect of this whiskey isn’t its variety of flavors (they are fairly traditional for a bourbon this age) it’s their integration and remarkable balance! It’s also perilously drinkable. I can’t speak for the other barrels but if you can track down some bottles of Barrel No. 1 buy two! You won’t be disappointed. Let me also note what a great value this whiskey is compared to the way other premium American whiskeys are being priced."
807,9,"Like the William Larue Weller releases a couple years back I felt that the Stagg releases (after being brought down in strength) were almost too easy-going. Like the new Weller release this bourbon has improved greatly to classic status. Clean balanced notes of toffee molasses nougat polished leather dates roasted nuts cinnamon subtle summer fruits teasing mint ground coffee nutmeg and a hint of tobacco. Long balanced finish. An outstanding bourbon!"
808,9,"The key to bourbons that use wheat instead of rye (like this Weller) is to get the right amount of wood influence to balance the sweet notes and add depth. This whiskey does a great job of it. Notes of dark fruit (blackberry plum blueberry) layered sweetness (maple syrup toffee caramel) and dried spice (cinnamon vanilla). Soft pleasant finish."
809,9,"There are two noteworthy items regarding this whiskey. It’s the first barrel-proof whiskey released by Heaven Hill for the U.S. market. It’s also the first of what will be an ongoing series of releases under the “Parker’s Heritage Collection” label. This one is rich with thick toffee molasses vanilla fudge and Heath bar. It’s also well balanced with underlying exotic spice summer fruit dusty corn and tobacco to balance the sweeter notes. Long soothing finish. A nicely matured bourbon of character and pedigree. (Originally reviewed in Volume 16 No. 4)"
810,5,"This is a work of art. It begins by revealing vanilla from custard to cake icing. Then it speaks caramel with a dark chew crème brûlée and Werther’s Original hard candy. From here complexity takes over with candied popcorn butterscotch chocolate ganache French toast maple honey pumpkin pie fried pie dough blueberries and cinnamon with hints of molasses and pecan. The long finish seems to offer a concentration of all the flavors. Delicious. Editor's Choice."
811,9,"Batch #1 while a very good bourbon didn’t quite seem to reach its potential. The flavors were there but were not integrated and as cohesive as I would have hoped for in a four-grain pot-distilled bourbon. Batch #2 has realized this whiskey’s full potential. The flavors I expect are all there and they are more tightly integrated and polished. It really does taste different than any other bourbon on the market. I particularly enjoy its silky creamy nutty sweetness which is balanced nicely with dry spice notes that peak on the finish. It’s very soothing and enjoyable. A whisky for bourbon and scotch drinkers alike."
812,8,"This offers up warming ginger candied orange and wisps of furniture polish. The lavish and leathery oak flavors are apparent but don’t overwhelm the abundance of zippy bright citrus—orange oil and yuzu—as the palate unleashes wave upon wave of spices that keep you guessing where it will head next. In the end more lingering ginger and dusty cocoa."
813,9,"Seamless in flavor and very elegant. A fully matured bourbon (consisting of whiskeys from 11 to 16 years in age) yet quite fresh on the palate. Lively fruit (apricot red raspberry tangerine) on a bed of lush sweet notes (caramel honey-coconut crème brûlée and cotton candy) peppered with cinnamon clove and crisp mint. Soft finish with lingering creamy vanilla. Not as great as the legendary 2013 release but close."
814,9,"Surprisingly light and fresh for a 15 year old whiskey. Crisply spiced with cinnamon evergreen vanilla anise and teaberry. Hints of dried fruit kissed with light honey and a wisp of smoke. Balanced and clean throughout and very drinkable. An excellent whiskey! Price is per 375ml."
815,2,"Wheated bourbons which feature wheat rather than rye as their secondary grain to corn have attracted legions of devotees in recent years despite being relatively few compared to their rye counterparts. “Wheaters” like Pappy Van Winkle have achieved rock star status putting them out of reach for many of us. So when we taste a widely available wheated bourbon that displays the soft sweet fruity profile of the style we take note.

Larceny Barrel Proof our Whisky of the Year delivers on wheated bourbon’s appeal and then some. Big and powerful it enters the ring at 61.1% ABV but it’s no lumbering heavyweight. It floats across the palate with stunning grace and subtlety its wheated mashbill a delicate counterpoint to its formidable proof. It begins with a flurry of sweet bakery aromas: honey bun angel food cake and apple pie à la mode. The palate dazzles with notes of crème brûlée chocolate drizzled caramel honey-roasted peanuts and lashings of baking spice followed by a lengthy finish loaded with cinnamon more chocolate and robust spice. Water helps unleash layers of these flavors but Larceny Barrel Proof is amazingly enjoyable even at full proof—no easy thing for a whiskey this big.

The original Larceny Small Batch debuted in 2012 as the modern heir to owner Heaven Hill’s historic wheater Old Fitzgerald. Following a few special appearances this barrel-proof version launched to the general public in January 2020 offering wheated bourbon lovers an exceptional treat that’s also widely available—at a very affordable $50.

Larceny Barrel Proof is released in three batches annually in January May and September. Each year the releases are labeled with a code using a letter to indicate the sequence and three digits indicating the month and year. This award goes to B520 but you’d be wise to give any of them a try. Number 1 in the 2020 Top 20"
816,12,"Until now most Knob Creek has been bottled at 9 years of age or younger for good reason: There’s no guarantee that bourbon will taste good after a dozen years in the barrel—let alone great. This one is richly complex from the start: York Peppermint Pattie raisins baking spice dark chocolate-covered cherries iced tea and tobacco barn appear on the nose followed by a chewy full palate laden with cinnamon allspice and ginger and perfectly balanced with sweet berry cobbler chocolate ganache and caramel. The finish goes on and on. Add in a fair price and excellent availability as part of Knob Creek’s core lineup and only one question remains: What are you waiting for? Number 2 in the 2020 Top 20"
817,2,"Blender Eboni Major makes her mark with this limited-edition whiskey that incorporates three distillates all at least 9 years old. The multiple flavor profiles and ages converge to create a hyper-charged bourbon with layers of flavor. A lively nose offers raspberry chocolate mint confectioners’ sugar and candied pecans. The palate is bold with flavors of cherry spearmint dark chocolate nougat pepper and polished oak. More mint follows on the finish along with bitter chocolate dark berries and spice. Each batch will have its own profile and this incredible inaugural effort promises more greatness to come. Number 4 in the 2020 Top 20"
819,9,"Less alcohol than past Staggs even at 128.2° proof. This whiskey has always been one of the best in the portfolio and its reputation is intact. Sweeter and fuller in body than recent releases and not as masculine making it easier to drink. (Don’t worry; it’s still a big Stagg but with a smaller “rack.”) Vanilla taffy nougat dates polished oak roasted nuts leather and tobacco: it’s all there. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013."
820,9,"The traditionally gentle demeanor of this wheated bourbon is jazzed up with some lovely complex spice (mostly coming from the oak). Sweet notes of maple syrup silky caramel blackberry jam and blueberry are peppered with notes of allspice spiked with cinnamon and vanilla. Soft leather on the finish. Great balance. A lovely whiskey! Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013 Release."
821,9,"Still lively for 18 years old with no hint of interfering oak. The age has softened the rye spice making it an easy entry into the premium rye category. The balance here is beautiful with rounded spice (mint cinnamon licorice root) on a bed of soft vanilla and caramel. Gently dry finish. Very sophisticated for a rye. It remains my benchmark for extra-matured rye whiskeys which are becoming exceedingly scarce. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013 Release."
822,9,"A benchmark aged rye whiskey and it’s similar in profile to recent releases . Vibrant for its age. Complex too brimming with allspice clove mint and cinnamon. The spice notes are balanced by soft vanilla soothing caramel and candied summer fruits. Impeccably balanced and a pure joy to drink!"
823,9,"No age statement but distilled in 1998. The only wheated recipe bourbon in the 2011 Antique Collection and a very good one at that. Higher in strength than last year’s offering (which was 63.3%) but very similar (and equally as impressive). The most elegant and smoothest of this collection with layered sweetness (honey caramel marzipan maple syrup) fig blackberry preserve hint of green tea and just the right amount of spice for balance (nutmeg cinnamon cocoa)."
824,9,"At this strength it’s almost like getting two whiskeys for the price of one. A great value considering its age. (It’s not identified on the label but was distilled in 1993.) Try to find a great 18 year old cask-strength single malt scotch for this price. Very mature — with a good dose of oak — but not excessively so. Notes of toffee tobacco dark molasses roasted nuts dried vanilla leather and a hint of dusty corn. Dry on the finish with lingering leather and tobacco."
825,8,"From first sniff it’s clear this is mature and stately stuff. It’s quite oak-driven but rather than purely primary wood it smells of fine leather cedar chest polished handrails and barrel warehouse. Beneath the woody splendor lurks a core of rich black cherry fruit which permeates the full-bodied palate oozing with dark berry fruit that slowly succumbs to butterscotch espresso chocolate-covered cherries and drying tannins. A masterful work of balance and lush flavors. Collectibles"
826,12,"This has Dickel’s distinctive oily grain aromas: It’s packed with corn and peanuts and also sweet with brown-sugar oatmeal and maple candy. Add a little water and voila! Orange peel and Luxardo cherry appear creating an instant Old Fashioned. The palate is chewy and full-bodied pepped up with cinnamon and dried ginger and lengthened by grape jelly Coca-Cola Corn Nuts and dried cherries. A full and lengthy finish sings with ginger peanuts and chocolaty oak."
827,9,"Aged in French oak chardonnay barrels for eight years after six years in new charred oak. Notes of vanilla crème brûlée butterscotch toasted coconut bright fruit and polished oak. Clean gently sweet finish. The chardonnay oak aging adds a new dimension without dominating. A distinctive stylish whisky with excellent balance."
828,9,"The barrel was heated to 102°F for 23 minutes to dry the wood. A lush silky-textured bourbon and very seductive. Caramel coconut cream marzipan vanilla wafer and bright honeyed fruit abound while teasing notes of tobacco anise subtle mint and a suggestion of bitter chocolate offer intrigue. A broad-shouldered heavyweight bourbon with plenty of grit."
829,9,"Aged in French oak barrels in which the staves were air-dried for 24 months. Incredibly rich notes of caramel chewy toffee and maple syrup. All this sweetness is balanced nicely by firm polished oak and the whiskey is kept lively with delicate candied fruit and crisp mint. Dry elegant finish."
830,9,"The other whiskeys in the Antique Collection get all the attention but for the past few years Eagle Rare 17 year old has been very impressive. This year’s edition features vanilla taffy caramel almonds maple syrup and candy corn with balancing notes of polished leather summer fruit a dusting of cinnamon mocha and soft mint. The flavors are nicely integrated with good depth. A rock-solid effort that will not disappoint."
831,9,"Deep amber with shades of copper. Background notes of spearmint marzipan teaberry and cinnamon compliment mature exotic aromas of ripe candied fruit vanilla molasses and leather. Thick chewy body. Flavors of candied sweetness and ripe fruit up front yielding to molasses subtle spices and ultimately dry leather. Long warming contemplative finish."
832,5,"This is the Wild Turkey limited edition bourbon we’ve been waiting for. Only 2070 bottles exist. Deep amber hues and non-chill filtered it opens up to straight-from-the-woods campfire smoke caramel vanilla fresh-baked macaroon leather woodworking shop and cigar box. But it’s not a smoke bomb or saturated in sweet; its delicate baking spices meet hatch chile cinnamon hints of mint and citrus. It finishes strong and long with a lingering caramel chew."
833,12,"Why do I get the feeling I’m about to tuck into dessert? Just-cooked berries with brown sugar crumble marzipan toasted coconut flakes vanilla and orange wedges on the nose. More fruit cobbler brown sugar sweet toasted nuts Nutella and rich spice on the palate which turns from chewy to silky with water. The finish goes on for days laden with red fruit roasted nuts dark chocolate and well-integrated spice."
834,2,"Spice and fresh herbs on the nose yielding to lemon meringue pie peach tart whipped cream and baking spice. Bakery notes of cherry pie and red berries get things going on the palate followed by sweet notes of vanilla wafer and frosted yellow cupcake atop herbs and spice all accentuated with water. A long finish of Boston cream pie coconut ice cream baking spice zesty herbs and cigar ash."
835,2,"Distilled in Tennessee from a mashbill of 84% corn 8% rye and 8% malted barley. Licorice candied melon breakfast cereal cream soda vanilla ice cream and strawberry tart on the nose. A rich palate offers balanced spice banana cherry cola strawberries and cream chocolate and baking spice. The finish is smooth with light earthiness tobacco leaf and fragrant oak followed by brown sugar coconut chocolate and spice at the back."
895,9,"Deep amber color. Rich mature aroma of molasses maple syrup and leather with background notes of creamy vanilla tobacco and subtle mint. Full thick mouth-coating body. Sweet up front (molasses maple syrup rich toffee candied fruit) becoming spicy (vanilla mint) and then dry with notes of leather and tobacco. Long dry finish."
836,2,"This year’s barrel-strength release comprised of several aged bourbons offers bakery shop notes on the nose along with vanillin fragrant orange soft spice new leather and drying tannins. The mouthfeel is soft and viscous with emerging flavors of candied orange slices allspice black pepper and scents of aged oak. The finish is notably smooth as sweeter notes of tiramisu and cola are deftly balanced with an overlay of spice and dusty oak."
837,12,"Sweet grain-driven aromas dominate the nose: blueberry pancakes with maple syrup orange marmalade on toast honey-roasted peanuts toasted coconut brown sugar and cherry cordial candies. The palate is equally expressive chewy with peanuts and roasted pecans milk chocolate orange cinnamon ginger white pepper and big chunky oak which turns mouthwatering on the lengthy peppery nutty finish. Though a proof this high can get unwieldy it never shows a hair out of place."
838,9,"The 11th annual vintage release of Evan Williams and judging by the taste of this bourbon there’s no shortage of excellent bourbon to bottle. This is a rich seductive bourbon. Sticky toffee maple syrup and vanilla cream notes up front are followed by candied fruit refreshing mint and spicy cinnamon. Dry resinous oak finish. Kentucky’s answer to a beautifully sherried Speyside single malt scotch. Outstanding!"
839,8,"Initially tight on the nose the gentle vanilla and delicate spice are draped in leather and dusty oak floorboards. Maturity is present on the palate as well not only in the full body but also in the form of intense vanilla and citrus furniture polish like orange oil. At the same time it’s quite lively as a burst of dark fruits cassis and licorice rises from the depths before the drying oak finish."
840,5,"Simply beautiful. It’s so complex with notes of molasses apple butter toffee salt water taffy hazelnut burnt brown sugar crème brûlée caramel flan butterscotch crystallized ginger nutmeg cardamom fenugreek roasted almonds and marshmallow. With a drop of water another complex layer forms with cotton candy and burnt pie crust. In both cases it finishes extremely long."
841,2,"Sweet notes of grape jelly cherry pie orange peel and brown sugar balance on the nose against mature whiskey aromas of earth leather and antique closet. A powerful palate is driven by rich dark-chocolate fudge blackberry tart almond tangerine slices raisin bread and spiced oak. A lengthy finish offers leather and spice cinnamon chocolate-covered blueberries strawberries cocoa and oak. Water makes the flavors of this powerhouse even more impressive."
842,8,"Lovely aromas of warm banana bread with toasted nuts are met with oak and underlying savory notes of garden soil mushroom barnyard and menthol that build layers of complexity. The flavor similarly melds sweet and earthy notes as Bit-O-Honey and grape candy yield to zesty lemon drying tobacco leaf and polished oak tannins. The sweetness perfectly permeated with earthy complexity is totally captivating made complete by a long and satisfying finish laced with spices."
843,12,"Deeply complex from the start with rich aromas of nuts spice cola marzipan vanilla frosting and earthy leather and tobacco; with water the maturity shows itself in the rancio note of solvent. Chewy and full-bodied in the mouth with oodles of chocolate-covered nuts coffee bean cordial cherries ground ginger and white and black peppers. Water adds a light citrus note. The finish goes on for many minutes still full in the mouth with peppery and chocolaty oak dominating."
844,9,"The first release of Stagg was our 'American Whiskey of the Year' for 2003. I couldn’t imagine this one being better but it is. This is a textbook example of what older more mature bourbon should taste like: great depth and maturity yet nicely balanced without excessive woodiness on the palate. It is spicier and creamier on the nose than the first bottling with more vanilla tones and not quite as dry on the finish. Indeed it hints of a softer gentler side. But with a name like Stagg it can be nothing more than a hint. Other flavors you’ll enjoy in this bourbon include spearmint teaberry candied fruit leather and toffee. Given its high proof and reasonable price it’s also a great value. (Like Campbell’s soup just add water.)"
845,9,"Usually the least talked-about in the Antique Collection but in my opinion certainly of the same caliber. This year’s release proves my point: nutty toffee and rummy molasses notes balanced nicely with dried fruit cinnamon polished oak subtle leather and tobacco. The oak is kept in check for such an age and all the flavors work well together. Nicely done!"
846,2,"Candy corn butter warm frosted buns strawberry tart and powdered sugar on the nose. The palate is spiced with cinnamon clove and roasted walnuts as well as chocolate-covered cherries raspberry cobbler and a hint of coconut shavings. Length depth and heat on a finish of chocolate caramel and bursts of sweet baking spice. Deep and complex balancing dark fruits chocolate spice and tobacco. Powerful and subtle all at once."
847,9,"Buffalo Trace distilled a wheated bourbon and aged barrels from the same distillation date on three different floors (1 5 and 9) for 12 ½ years to see what the differences would be. This is similar to an experiment they conducted last year using a rye mashbill bourbon. As you will see the higher the floor the more intense the flavors and the greater the wood influence.

Nicely balanced flavors and complex. Spices dance on the palate (cinnamon clove nutmeg) balanced by underlying caramel and butterscotch and subtle honeyed orchard fruit. Lingering well-rounded finish. A fabulous wheated bourbon!  Price is per 375 ml. Editor's Choice."
848,5,"This is an ode to this bourbon’s old-school style that post-caramel and cinnamon is balanced with dried blueberries sweet cornbread nutmeg saffron citrus and slight hints of chipotle ginger and clove. Under the beautiful spice come vanilla cake batter almond butter and salt water taffy that walk it to a finish that just doesn’t quit. It’s the vanilla-forward finish that makes this an upper-echelon whiskey. (13800 bottles for the U.S.)"
849,5,"Caramel. Caramel. Caramel. It comes early and remains to the finish. In between this caramel sandwich it’s nutmeg cinnamon jasmine rose petals baked apples fudge pecan pie peanut brittle and roasted peanuts. Over a mouth-coating palate its complexity tingles and every note plays just under the rich and layered caramel that presents itself as a chew on the extremely long finish. This is a must-have sipper."
850,12,"Powerful aromas of blackberry cobbler brown sugar honey baking spices cola peanuts in the shell and hay loft give way to a muscular palate that despite its big oak character never becomes bitter. Zingy lemon oil dark berries cola syrup espresso dark chocolate and roasted peanuts fill out a chewy mouthfeel. The finish has excellent length with rich flavors of chocolate coffee roasted nuts and spices."
851,12,"A generous nose with chocolate-covered cherries candied orange peel menthol cola pine nuts caramel corn bread and varnish. Piles of baking spice and dark chocolate shavings on the palate mingle with raspberry jam orange peel gingersnaps cinnamon and mint; water amplifies and brightens the fruit character. A lip-smacking finish of dark chocolate mint tobacco and polished oak."
853,12,"Mature aromas of leather shoe polish blueberry pie and iced tea mingle with brown sugar walnuts gingerbread and—after some time in the glass—rose perfume. The palate is chewy like a well-made chocolate bar rich with roasted and candied nuts blackberry cobbler dark chocolate dried ginger and white pepper; water and time bring out rose water. The complexity of the palate carries through to the finish full of coffee bean Coca-Cola gingerbread bittersweet oak and a touch of mint oil. (5000 bottles)"
854,9,"While labeled as a 17 year old it’s actually 19 distilled way back in 1988. Each year’s release of this whiskey just seems to get better and better. Some of the earlier vintages turned slightly oaky and dry for balance (the 10 year old Single Barrel Eagle Rare whiskeys did too a while back) but Buffalo Trace just keeps on improving the line. Tight well-balanced notes of molasses vanilla candied fruit and sweet corn peppered with crisp mint cinnamon and polished leather. Eagle Rare 17 is evolving into a whiskey of classic proportion."
855,12,"Distilled in Indiana and finished at Bardstown Bourbon Company in barrels that previously held Goodwood Brewing Company's Brandy Barrel Honey ale. The honey is immediately apparent on the nose along with molasses sweet pecans cherry pie baking spices and peanut butter cookies. Viscous and thick on the palate with flavors of roasted peanuts dark chocolate leathery oak cooked cherries citrus oil and velvety baking spices which persist into the finish along with root beer blueberries grapefruit oil and copious chocolate. (104 bottles)"
856,2,"Aromas of corn meal corn muffins and buttered toast on the nose along with vanilla frosting warm raspberry tart nuttiness and polished oak. A big palate offers baking spice vanilla ice cream blackberries and coconut shavings. A long finish of rich caramel chocolate cracked pepper and roasted coffee beans is completed by a final note of cigar ash. Warm and inviting as the sweetness melds gracefully with dark fruit and spice."
857,9,"Antique amber color. Mature aromas of candied fruit ripe berries and black currants nicely interwoven with toffee dates vanilla and almonds. Reminiscent of aromas found in a candy shop. Fairly rich body and smooth. Nice balance of flavors witha gentle sweetness and oaky dryness throughout. An even-keeled whiskey. There are notes of candied fruit ripe berries vanilla marzipan and dates with suggestions of sweet corn vanilla charcoal and cinnamon. Becoming dry with a mature finish."
858,9,"A clean well-rounded bourbon packed with flavor. Deep amber with tinges of gold. Rich silky aromas with thickly textured seamless flavors on the palate. Incredibly smooth too with interwoven notes of toffee molasses creamy vanilla and candy corn. Underlying lush fruit cinnamon and fresh mint -- especially on the finish -- round everything out. Some of the previous “extra matured” Wild Turkey whiskeys have occasionally shown their age on the finish being a little heavy on the oak. Not this one. Nicely done."
859,9,"A special bottling of Wild Turkey to celebrate Master Distiller Jimmy Russell’s 50 years of being in the bourbon business. Jimmy will be proud to be associated with this bottling. In many ways this bourbon is a lot like Jimmy: mature yet with plenty of spunk and character and a pure joy to be with. This is a big chewy full-bodied bourbon with lovely sweet notes (maple syrup molasses caramel and candied fruit) balanced by dry spice notes (cigars aged in cedar evergreen polished leather). For bourbon drinkers who love intensity in their bourbon."
860,8,"This basks in beautiful baking spices—clove nutmeg and cinnamon—with toasty oak and candle wax hinting at its maturity. The palate is wonderfully dense with fruit including flavors of marmalade strawberry jam and bright tropical fruits woven with more spice. Even with water the richness and viscosity stand tall as more caramel and butterscotch emerge. The spellbinding finish is long sweet and nutty. Editors' Choice"
861,5,"Here a perfect harmony delivers crème brûlée butterscotch fruit cinnamon and rising cornbread. Right away complexity sets in delivering salted baked almonds cashews dried apricot pistachio gelato Nutter Butters salted caramel popcorn rye toast with brown sugar butter and sugarcane. Somehow a drop of water makes it even more complex amplifying the butterscotch and presenting cinnamon-soaked roasted pecans and almonds. Pure bliss; a must-sip."
862,8,"Clover honey floral notes bright citrus marzipan nutmeg and cinnamon initiate a mesmerizing succession of flavors. On the palate the impeccable balance of sweetness and spice introduces candied orange peel and cinnamon hearts candies. What is remarkable is how a bourbon this potent can play host to such delicate flavors making it both massive and bright. The creamy sweetness rolls on and on with waves of exotic sandalwood and spice appearing on the finish."
863,12,"A basket of berries—blue black and rasp—plus brown sugar dark chocolate iced tea and walnuts in syrup on the nose. The berries carry through to the palate though it’s more chocolate-oriented with cocoa powder coffee bean and peanut butter-swirled brownies. It’s full and deep and remarkably smooth without water though a drop or two doesn’t go amiss. The finish is full and lengthy with chocolate roasted walnuts rich oak and a hint of spice. Outstanding. (8340 bottles)"
864,2,"Elijah Craig Barrel Proof Batch B517 was our Whisky of the Year in 2017 and this latest release continues the tradition. The nose exudes spice rich chocolate and caramel followed by a palate that’s loaded with spice herbs vanilla and more chocolate. Water enhances the spice and also brings out an espresso note. A spice-filled finish is rich and chocolaty. Water enhances it all but even without it’s superbly balanced and rich."
865,8,"A very intriguing nose suggests brewed sweet tea caramel and eclectic fruits that span blackberry cherry and bruised apples with flickers of baking spice and toasted almond. The palate is somewhat jammy as sweet cooked fruit—damsons and currants—come sprinkled among more spice. Really beguiling and moreish with its dark fruit perfect burnt sugar edge and tea-like tannin on the finish. (2474 bottles)"
866,12,"One sniff is like opening a box of chocolates—plenty of different aromas from raspberry filling to pecans to spice but all suffused with cacao an impression borne out by the rich full palate. Think dark chocolate torte cocoa-dusted truffles bits of semi-sweet baker’s chocolate broken off the bar and snuck into the mouth. More cocoa powder toasted nuts and polished oak on the finish which is shot through with cinnamon and pepper."
867,12,"Oak always leads the character of well-aged bourbon sometimes dominating it but here the balance is just right. The nose gives an impression of sweet syrupy fruit like candied orange peel and cherries jubilee; there’s also creamy flan dusty spice cocoa powder and leather bookbindings. Richly oaked and dense with flavor the palate has dark chocolate roasted walnuts cola black currant jam and peppermint. It finishes generously with mint-flavored dark chocolate blackberry jam and coffee bean. Skip the water. (14400 bottles)"
868,5,"Wild Turkey often exhibits a delightful earthiness and when earth meets sweet in whiskey it’s a beautiful thing. Wild Turkey Master’s Keep Decades achieves a rich texture where deep-tilled soil fresh-cut grass and mushrooms meet leather and dark chocolate followed by dill oregano and oak. Caramel and vanilla explode over a heavy dose of cinnamon. Master distiller Eddie Russell mingled barrels ranging from 10 to 20 years old in order to strike this balance and complexity. His method displays the potential of combining extremely old stocks into batches with younger barrels to build a great whiskey. Number 3 in the 2017 Top 20"
869,8,"As bourbon matures in new charred oak barrels over time it approaches a perilous point when the oak dominates the flavor. To sip Elijah Craig at 12 years of age—at full barrel proof without dilution or filtering—is to taste bourbon at its apex so dangerously close to going over the crest of the hill yet delivering a massive mouthful of incredibly robust flavors that drape leathery oak over a gooey caramel core sprinkled with baking spice while candied nuts and tobacco leaf notes appear on a drying finish dusted with cocoa. Number 1 in the 2017 Top 20"
870,9,"Distilled in 2003. Weller is the only wheated bourbon in the Collection with wheat replacing the rye found in most other bourbons. It’s a very impressive representation too. Notes of nutty toffee black raspberry blueberry green tea cinnamon and vanilla. Soft lingering oak on the finish. Like last year’s release this is a soothing whiskey with a gentle demeanor. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2016. Editor's Choice."
871,12,"The most muscular whiskeys can sometimes feel like bullies attempting to subdue your palate but this one shows its strength without aggression. Deeply sweet and nutty on the nose with pralines butterscotch and maple syrup along with candied orange peel and cherry juice. The palate has a strong backbone of spice—ginger chiles and black pepper—while generous oak fills out the frame and over all of it dark fruit flavors drip: boysenberry syrup cherry juice and blackberry jam. The lengthy finish sprinkles a bit of tobacco and a generous amount of cocoa powder."
872,9,"This new single barrel expression of Knob Creek tastes very similar to the original “small batch” Knob Creek (when brought down to the same alcohol level). If anything it’s slightly drier more elegant not as heavy on the palate and more sophisticated — but I am reaching here. The similarity is a good thing because I really enjoy the original expression. Keeping in mind that no two barrels are exactly alike your decision to purchase the single barrel might just come down to whether you want to pay a little more for a higher strength version and whether knowing that it might taste a little different than the standard small batch bottling excites you. This is a stylish big broad-shouldered bourbon with a thick sweet foundation (nutty toffee pot still rum maple syrup) peppered with spice (cinnamon but also vanilla and evergreen) and dried fruit. Dry warming resinous finish. (Incidentally I would rate the small batch within a point or two and the tasting notes would be very similar.)"
873,9,"Surprisingly reserved on the oak spice; it tastes like a bourbon half its age. Soothing in nature with layers of sweetness (honey vanilla cream caramel nougat) lively complex fruit (coconut pineapple ripe peach honeydew melon) and gentle cinnamon. Soft creamy finish. A whiskey that has aged very gracefully. Delicious! (This is a single barrel; every barrel is unique.)"
874,9,"No age statement but distilled in 2000. A great value if you can find it for $80. An aggressive whiskey but complex too showing toffee nougat dates black raspberry dark chocolate and resinous oak. Leather and tobacco on the finish. Masculine and exciting. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2015 Release."
875,8,"Following Tennessee’s practice of charcoal-filtering the distillate before aging this whiskey is soft around the edges yet delivers plenty of intensity. The mouthwatering peanut aromas evoke memories of cracking open a school lunchbox while the palate delivers abundant fruit: orange marmalade and caramel apple. Fine bitter-sweet balance suggests burnt sugar Mexican chocolate chocolate-covered almonds and toffee. Indeed sweet nuts like French burnt peanuts candied pralines and marron glacé seem to be the common thread here lending this a consistent chord from initial nose through the drying pleasantly spiced finish. As recently as 2016 Dickel appeared to be reeling following the departure of two longtime distillers. In 2018 33 year old Nicole Austin a chemical engineering graduate who got her start with New York craft distiller Kings County Distillery took over as general manager and distiller. Austin set about cherry-picking the warehouses for exceptional barrels a dramatic change of course from the just-released George Dickel Tabasco Brand Barrel Finish finished in hot sauce barrels. The result is this 13 year old whiskey which like all bottled in bond spirits results from one distilling season—here the fall of 2005. In this way bottled in bond whiskey is similar to a vintage wine making this release a limited edition by definition. We relish well-aged delicious whiskey at a bargain price—and all whiskey lovers have reason to applaud George Dickel on hitting its stride. Number 1 in the 2019 Top 20"
876,9,"Often overlooked in this portfolio because it isn’t barrel proof. The last few years of this bourbon have been wonderful. This year is no exception with a bit more spice. Notes of nutty toffee caramel creamy vanilla and pot still rum with interwoven hints of oak resin dried spice tobacco and honeyed fruit. Hint of barrel char and anise for intrigue. Delicious! (And actually 19 years old even though it bears the traditional 17 year age statement.) Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013 Release."
877,8,"Known for pushing boundaries the Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection series has been a mixed bag over the years. With Batch Proof Woodford literally plays to its strength. This bourbon takes the same mashbill flavor profile and beautiful blending that makes up the standard 90.4-proof Woodford Reserve and ups the intensity to 123.2 proof uncut and unfiltered. “Batch Proof” is Woodford’s answer to other distilleries’ single-barrel products. Now an annual spring release Batch Proof doubles down on what Woodford does best upping the banana pudding dark spice and toasty oak notes to decadent new heights. Number 6 in the 2019 Top 20"
878,2,"Old Ezra’s owner Luxco historically has played the role of whiskey négoçiant sourcing liquid from third-party distillers. In 2018 the company opened its own distillery in Bardstown Ky. where it’s now laying down whiskey. While we wait for it to mature we’ll happily savor the sourced version. This is Ezra Brooks’ first ever barrel-proof bourbon and it’s a beauty. A spice storm of cinnamon clove ginger and roasted pecan greets the palate easing into sweet notes of melted caramel chocolate macaroons marzipan and crème brûlée. Earthy hints of sandalwood and tobacco complete the finish making this everything a great bourbon should be. Number 7 in the 2019 Top 20"
896,9,"Complex fruit (clementine pineapple golden raisin) balanced nicely with honey vanilla custard and dusty corn along with a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg. An extremely versatile whiskey with its medium weight easy to embrace personality and subtle charms. Perennially one of the best values in whiskey. Editor's Choice and Value Pick."
879,8,"A rich aroma dominated by vanilla pralines and cola showcases well-integrated wood that smacks of tobacco candied nuts and dark chocolate. The palate is similarly rich full and sultry-smooth with no perceptible alcohol heat just heaps of brown sugar seductive spice and fine leather. The maturity and refinement here are lovely to behold—fruit spice and earth draped over crystalline sweetness. Collectibles"
880,12,"Aromas of concord grape jelly vanilla crumb cake dusty baking spice leather tobacco barn iced tea and peanut shells are offset by citrus peel and rose oil especially prominent with a bit of water added. The bold rich palate is packed with dark berries baking spice semi-sweet chocolate and espresso with pops of citrus fruit and spearmint adding liveliness and verve. It finishes with blackberry cobbler dark chocolate leathery oak and undercurrents of black pepper and baking spice that don’t quit. Restrained and elegant even at full proof."
881,8,"Sweet and toasty aromas like a coconut macaroon are balanced with bright green apple in this showstopper of a bourbon. Secondary notes include alluring five-spice cigar box and dark cherry fruit. The flavors really fulfill expectations as toasty notes of brown butter meet delicate spice candied peanuts and grilled peaches. But wait for the finish! A cascade of gingery and peppery spices grilled peaches and pecan descend in perfect harmony. A multifaceted bourbon that is as intriguing as it is delicious. Editors' Choice"
882,8,"Age is readily apparent not as weariness but sheer intensity—like a Vise-Grip handshake from an old man. The flavors come in rapid waves first on the nose with pipe tobacco dark chocolate sassafras cassis licorice orange peel and menthol-like hints of solvent. Then chewy fruit and drying oak harmonize on the palate the dark berry fruits playing off the refined oak with its cedary spice. The drying finish echoes of rustling autumn leaves and plum skins. Exquisitely balanced and muscular."
883,9,"Very close to last year’s release in personality with great balance between the sweetness spice and fruit. Nicely structured with clearly defined notes of toffee molasses cinnamon vanilla bean dried citrus brittle mint roasted nuts tobacco and polished leather on the finish. (Editor's Choice)"
884,9,"Distilled in 2003. Weller is the wheated bourbon in the Collection where wheat replaces the rye found in most other bourbons. The sweetness is balanced nicely by a solid peppering of oak spice. Notes of toffee maple syrup fig black raspberry preserve cinnamon and vanilla. Lingering oak and polished leather on the finish."
885,9,"Aged in slow-growth wood. I love the balance in this whiskey with all the flavors presented harmoniously. Rather lively for a bourbon approaching 15 years. Notes of bright fruit (peach kiwi golden raisin) soft vanilla crème caramel lemon meringue and coconut macaroon then drying out nicely to a rather sophisticated cinnamon-tinged polished oak finish."
886,8,"An herbal nose featuring menthol eucalyptus and horehound is endowed with plenty of earthy oak evoking sawmill empty wine casks and dusty floorboards. Generous oak courses through the palate the drying tannins reining in the dense sweetness as the whiskey brandishes bold spices including allspice pepper and clove. Water gives this bourbon much needed room to run revealing greater polish and rich layers of flavor."
887,2,"A blend of different bourbons aged 15 14 12 7 and 6 years. A bakery shop nose offers confectioners’ sugar and warm cherry pie. On the palate wild strawberry and cooked fruit notes of baked apples and raspberry tart meld with tiramisu and black pepper all well-balanced against leather and oak. The finish offers chocolate spice raspberry cinnamon bitter almond and lightly roasted coffee beans. Powerful but balanced and superbly well-integrated. (10314 bottles)"
888,8,"This kicks off with a bounty of dark fruit—dark berries cherry cough drops and currants—coupled with heaps of vanilla mocha and rich oaky notes. Big and brawny on the palate it pours bold and viscous the blueberry and blackberry fruit balanced with the sweet-bitter notes of burnt sugar and pipe tobacco. The flavors harmonize beautifully culminating in a finish of dark jam coffee and semi-sweet chocolate."
889,12,"Butter pecan ice cream peanuts in the shell oily grain milk chocolate cooked orange cherry tart and blueberries on the nose. The palate is spiced nutty and chewy with milk chocolate orange soda cherry cough drop baking spice brown sugar a hint of eucalyptus and loads of peanuts. More rich spice chocolate and fruit on the finish along with peanut butter spearmint and generous oak. Not a hair out of place."
890,8,"Lovely lavender-like florals and sweet Bit-O-Honey candies introduce this whiskey with secondary aromas that suggest the vivid spice and earthy leather that lurk on the palate. Pleasantly sweet pineapple and citrus keep things bright on the palate along with flavors of chocolate-covered banana. The final show of dusty oak tannins is laced with bitter espresso then cocoa powder ending with hints of furniture polish. An intense volley of flavors skillfully integrated."
891,12,"Deeply inviting on the nose and satisfying on the palate. Aromas of iced tea orange Tang peanuts dark fruit weathered oak leather and spices comingle with the freshness of an alpine retreat. Flavors and texture fill the mouth: chewy oak semi-sweet chocolate cinnamon plums walnuts cherry cough syrup orange oil and cloves. Cooked dark fruit semi-sweet chocolate and copious mature oak on the finish which is velvety and expansive. Needless to say at this proof it benefits from generous amounts of water. (6000 bottles)"
892,2,"This year’s first of three annual releases has a higher ABV than Whisky Advocate’s 2017 Whisky of the Year which was 62.1%. The nose offers caramel vanilla cream pie cocoa powder baking spice baked apple orange marzipan leather and oak. Very well-integrated on the palate but the high ABV cries out for water which brings chocolate butterscotch bitter orange coconut almond and creamed corn. The finish is a long delightful reprise of it all. Editors' Choice"
893,5,"A 7 year old single barrel. Fruit and flowers jump out of the glass with caramel popcorn and dried apricot not far behind. Caramel berry fruit and baking spices develop into complex and rounded notes of crème brûlée blackberries blueberry pie burnt brown sugar coconut and pumpkin pie with extra nutmeg. Long finish delivers a hint of peach cobbler crust. The perfect example of a below 90-proof whiskey with complexity. (Liquor Barn Springhurst exclusive)"
894,9,"A significant improvement over the previous release in 2007 which I felt was the weakest of Buffalo Trace’s Antique Collection that year. Wheated bourbons like William Larue Weller lack the bold zing of rye and therefore are vulnerable to being too tame too easygoing like the 2007 release. What wheated whiskeys gain in drinkability they can lose in vibrancy and zest. The distiller might want to augment this and a good way to do this is by increasing the oak impact (spice resin balancing dryness) as was done (quite masterfully by the way) with this new expression. Sweet notes of vanilla custard maple syrup Demerara rum shortbread cookie and marzipan are balanced by raspberry jam cinnamon nutmeg teaberry and gentle oak resin that lingers on the finish. Great balance too!"
898,2,"A blend of straight bourbons 12 to 17 years old created by Kentucky Owl co-founder Dixon Dedman for the 100th anniversary of Prohibition. The nose is fragrant and gentle with confectioners’ sugar vanilla custard nougat marzipan strawberry jam leather and light spice. Caramel and raisin bread coat the palate accented by cinnamon toasted almond chocolate chicory and savory spice. A lengthy finish of chocolate and espresso ending with a burst of spice."
899,8,"The second in Maker’s wood finishing series benefits from the addition of virgin toasted American oak (PR5) and virgin French oak (SE4) staves. The nose is chewy and sweet with caramel manuka honey milk chocolate and wintergreen. The wood influence is right out in front with plenty of toasty oak and cedar pencil sprinkled with sweet vanilla and caramelized sugars. The lively palate serves up candied nuts and heaps of taffy-like vanilla sweetness coupled with some mature varnish."
900,8,"Oak-forward and earthy the nose is dominated by dark cigar wrapper leather grain bin and dry autumn leaves with overripe peaches and plenty of toasted pecan and walnut lurking just beneath. The palate is full-bodied and chewy yet displays the softness you’d expect from such a well-aged wheater as the flavor marries alluring caramel-and-maple sweetness with mixed nuts to achieve perfect balance."
901,12,"Sweet almost candied notes pervade the nose: brown sugar maraschino cherries Cherry Coke strawberry Twizzlers peanuts and baking spice. Candied dark fruit leads the palate with semi-sweet chocolate and nuts behind it; spice starts out soft and builds into the finish where it blooms into harmony with full-bodied oak coffee bean and baking chocolate. Delicious with or without water."
902,8,"This big sweet warming bourbon strikes all the right chords. Sizzling sweet corn meets generous oak like dusty old books but the bright peach nectar wet walnuts and vibrant spice beam through in abundance. Unctuous and concentrated on the palate it evokes cinnamon-dusted peach pie with hints of clove and pepper on the finish. A solid and seamless whiskey with fruit floral oak and spice in perfect harmony."
903,9,"All the current Elijah Craig 20 year old releases in distribution are single barrel offerings. I’ve tasted a few and they vary to a degree. This is my favorite so far. Yes there’s a lot of oak here (resinous spicy leathery tobacco-tinged) but it’s on a bed of layered sweetness (nutty toffee caramel fudge maple syrup) that supports and marries with the oak. An ideal postprandial bourbon."
904,9,"Antique amber color. Thick mature aromas of toffee leather candied fruit and mint. The aromas are tightly bound at cask strength but open up with a bit of water to reveal spicy wood resins and a hint of tobacco. Thick almost chewy in texture. Its flavors are similar to its aroma (and nicely balanced) with the sweeter notes (toffee candied fruit) up front and the drier more spicy notes (mint wood resins leather) beginning in the middle and continuing to its finish. A lovely balance of flavors and not one bit too old or woody."
905,9,"The fourth limited release Stagg in as many years. While there’s no age statement on the bottle this one is 16 years old. And in the same vein as its three predecessors this Stagg is an extremely seamless affair. What impresses me most about the annual Stagg releases is the whiskey’s incredible drinkability at remarkably high alcohol levels. Be stingy when adding water to this whiskey to appreciate its soothingly smooth oily texture and lovely notes of maple syrup vanilla cream dried corn candied fruit polished oak supple leather pencil shavings and subtle mint."
906,8,"Dripping with butterscotch and marzipan this is a gorgeous mix of confections and spice. The toasted sweetness of coconut macaroon cookies and graham cracker pie crust meets clove orange peel teaberry and a seductive sandalwood note. A whirlwind of spices grabs hold of the tongue sinking slowly into creamy nut butters earthy tannins and toasted pecan. The persistent sweet caramel and fruit handle generous water without yielding just revealing ever more flavor. Editors’ Choice"
907,8,"Bright clean and fruity with spearmint and oak this smells of chewy marmalade with pretty wildflower waxy crayon and solvent notes adding intrigue. On the palate the fruit feels dense—dried apricot and a cardboard box of prunes—before veering toward citrus and Peanut Chews. The generous finish lingers with bitter orange peel vanilla and sweet creamed corn. Complex fresh and immensely likable."
908,2,"A pleasant citrusy note of orange blossom on the nose followed by licorice dark cherry cinnamon and dusty oak. The palate is rich mouth-filling and jammy offering flavors of orange marmalade sweet vanilla maple syrup French toast and strawberry jam. The finish is sweet corn a reprise of orange as well as vanilla spice and light tobacco. A robust bourbon (ice or water recommended) that’s subtle at the same time."
909,8,"Keeps true to this award-winning whiskey’s oak-driven style with aromas of lead pencil leather and fresh sawdust balanced by dense fruitiness and tinged with herbal licorice and eucalyptus. Brawny and tannic on the palate it’s reminiscent of sucking on a cherry Popsicle stick balancing sweet caramel brown sugar and molasses with persistent oak cedar shingle clove and paprika. A rustic powerful and robust bourbon."
910,12,"Peanuts in the shell PayDay bars toasted grain caramel butterscotch purple plums ginger root black tea and layers of spice on the nose. The palate is rich and deep with dark chocolate roasted peanuts blueberry pie concord grapes Cherry Coke ginger black pepper and lush chai spices. It finishes velvety and full with persistent dark fruits roasted nuts and dark chocolate. At barrel proof this is a whiskey to explore: the more water you add the more depths you plumb."
911,12,"Walnuts in maple syrup grape jelly cooked cherries peanuts in Coke ginger syrup iced tea and varnish on the nose. Adding water first reveals sweeter notes then fully opens up the tightly wound palate unfurling bittersweet chocolate pipe tobacco cherry pie blackberry preserves roasted spices and sweet nuttiness. The lengthy finish is nutty and rich with generous spice chocolate oak and cola. Collectibles"
912,8,"This is a whiskey that knows exactly what it wants to be a rambunctious bourbon that throws the full weight of its barrel behind a flavor-packed punch. Lots of dry charred-matchstick oak meets chewy fig and dried fruits fudge brownie and fresh meadow with hints of banana and furniture polish in the aroma. Brawny and unapologetic on the palate; peach syrup and baked apples meet a torrent of spices as the moreish finish oozes on like chocolate lava cake. Collectible"
913,8,"Exudes a tantalizing and heady aroma of baking spices crème brûlée and toasted oak with Nilla Wafers and Jordan almonds lending confectionary notes. The oily mouthfeel and chewy viscosity are powerful yet balanced as the lovely caramelized sweetness of grilled pound cake meets blackberry lemon oil ginger and flickers of allspice. Focused and seamless in its rich tapestry of flavors. Editors’ Choice"
914,2,"A soft sweet nose of vanilla peanuts licorice molasses cherries bubble gum warehouse floor earthiness oak cedar and spice. The palate is chewy dense and mouth-filling with notes of cherry blackberry jam vanilla fudge almond tobacco leaf and soft oak. The long rich finish is the crowning moment ending the ride with chocolate cream pie almond a ring of tobacco leaf and a balanced oak influence. Holds its power superbly."
915,2,"The nose offers fragrant orange tea leaves honey blossom dried flowers strawberry laces and powdered sugar. The palate is surprisingly delicate with notes of cigar ash leather blackberry preserves vanilla milkshake and balanced oak. The finish is long and rich with dark fruit cherry strawberry allspice tobacco leaf and polished oak. Water brings out toasty notes cinnamon clove and strawberry preserves. Great depth richness and heat; stunningly formed."
916,9,"Style: Bourbon Color: Antique amber Aroma: Thick lush very complex and nicely balanced. Notes of polished leather and oak marry nicely with the toffee and caramel. Tobacco raisins and dates add complexity and diversity. Palate: Bold and voluptuous with notes similar to its aroma. Long soothing finish.
   General Comments: A big broad-shouldered bourbon jam-packed with flavors that just won't quit. Most bourbons of this age and intensity are too woody. Not this one. It is very well-balanced from beginning to end. Bravo! Price: upper $30s. Available nationwide but produced in limited quantities."
917,9,"Fully matured at 15 years as you would expect. Lovely array of flavors: candied fruit cinnamon nutmeg gritty oak resins vanilla fudge and firm corn. Underlying notes of tobacco and polished leather add complexity and intrigue without dominating kissed with a touch of honey. A remarkable value considering its age and strength."
918,9,"Similar in many ways to the 15. Less vibrant more mature. Less corn more maple syrup. Less nutmeg more teaberry. The most elegant sexy and stylish of the three and the best dovetailing of flavors. You might think that $90 is a lot of money for bourbon but this whiskey is fairly valued when compared to other spirits of this age."
919,2,"Pleasant aromas of confectionery store on the nose—candy apples milk chocolate grape jelly and candied coconut—as well as some fresh red fruit notes. Agreeably smooth on the palate with balanced sweet flavors of chocolate-covered raspberries candied almonds cinnamon spice and coffee. A rich finish offers mint dark chocolate drizzled caramel espresso beans and cinnamon. A crescendo of fresh red fruit completes a pleasant tasting journey through this well-structured whiskey."
920,12,"Peanuts corn muffin blueberry pancakes well-integrated spice grape soda maple syrup and orange peel on the nose. Chewy and rich with dark chocolate on the palate studded with dried blueberries and cherries Spanish peanuts and dark mocha flavors; water brings out rancio notes but stays on trend with the fancy trail mix profile. Very lengthy mocha cacao nib polished oak and roasted peanuts on the finish."
921,9,"No age statement but this whiskey was distilled in 1992. At 144.8 proof this is almost two whiskeys for the price of one. In true Stagg form this whiskey is dangerously drinkable -- even at higher strength (although you will still need to add copious quantities of water to this supercharged whiskey). Its dominant character is chewy toffee sweetness with maple syrup vanilla fudge and nougat. Additional notes of berried fruit tea spearmint and suggestions of tobacco. Very soothing. An incredible value considering its strength."
922,12,"There’s so much peanut in this whiskey it’s like standing in a JIF factory—but there’s also cracked corn mixed berries Coca-Cola and fresh apples on the nose along with weathered oak boards and when water is added floral perfume. Powerful dense oak and cooked cherries berries and pomegranate on the palate as well as cherry Popsicle and a heaping scoop of peanuts. The lengthy finish is rich with leathery oak baking spice roasted peanuts and dark chocolate-covered cherries."
923,2,"Roasted herbs peanuts and fragrant oak start things off on the nose followed by notes of dried cherries cornbread vanilla frosting and blueberry pie. A chewy palate offers honeyed almonds cherry pie and allspice. Water unlocks dark chocolate more cherry pie cinnamon spice and tobacco leaf. A long spiced finish shows lively herbs cinnamon sugar and strawberry jam. Water is highly recommended—it takes this already superb whiskey to even greater heights."
924,12,"Complex aromas of peanut butter on toast dulce de leche strawberry hard candy lemon iced tea dark berry jam orange cake and cola spices. More spice on the palate—cinnamon and dried ginger—along with peanut brittle milk chocolate mint orange peel green tea and ample oak. The finish is lengthy drawing out all the highlights of the nose and palate: cinnamon candy peanut butter peppery spice baking chocolate and sweet oak."
925,5,"Fruit bliss. Filled with apple pear dried apricot and peaches it then offers floral and rich caramel notes. Chocolate fried pie pumpkin pie and vanilla custard follow over a creamy mouthfeel. Then nuts set in including roasted almonds salted walnuts and pecans. Honey and malt appear toward the end for a long and wonderful finish with a light hint of cinnamon. Editor’s Choice"
926,12,"Prepare for sensory overload. Aromas of peanut butter blossom cookies molasses creamed corn iced tea cassis and marmalade hint at the decadence of the palate which is mouth-filling and chewy. Its flavors hit all the high points of outstanding bourbon: big and bold grain chocolate wet walnuts orange and cherry Jello nutmeg cinnamon white pepper tobacco leaf and waves of oak. Nuts nuts and more nuts on the finish with espresso chocolate and drying oak. Sourced from an undisclosed Tennessee distillery. 186 bottles; Doc’s Wine Spirits & More exclusive"
927,9,"Thick dark sweet notes of rummy molasses chewy toffee fig cake and some teasing notes of chocolate fudge. Between these layers of sweetness emerge notes of dark berried fruit and glazed citrus. A very seductive compelling whiskey. Liquid dessert."
928,12,"An inspiring surprise from America’s largest whiskey maker. Distilled and put through the Lincoln County Process just like Old No. 7 the distillate was filled at 100 proof into heavily toasted lightly charred barrels—similar to what would have been used in the 19th century—that were placed in the highest hottest parts of the warehouses. The whiskey is pure bliss with aromas of peanut butter crackers honey dark plums and gingerbread cookies. Chewy and rich with dark chocolate blackberry cobbler allspice cloves and refined oak it retains liveliness and verve. Longtime Jack fans will find a lot to love here as will those who haven’t revisited the brand in years. Number 3 in the 2018 Top 20"
929,5,"When earth meets sweet in whiskey it’s a beautiful thing. Here soil tilled deep fresh-cut grass and mushrooms meet leather and dark chocolate followed by dill oregano and oak. Caramel and vanilla explode over a heavy dose of cinnamon. There’s more: apple fritters spice and saltwater taffy tingle the palate until the long finish introduces for the first time a hint of doughy pie crust. A must-have."
930,8,"A beguiling nose balances maturity and freshness with charred oak caramelized sugar blackberry pie filling floral notes and toasted almond evolving in deep layers. The concentration on the palate is jaw-dropping—so much richness power and grace as flavors flit across the tongue. Robust and drinkable the fruity pie filling turns to candied orange peel and buckwheat honey before a licorice-laced finish. (13140 bottles) Collectible"
931,8,"An impressive nose of cedar cigar box sweet cornbread crusts leathery oak and sweeping vanilla introduce this decadent whiskey. On the palate the prolific oak offers lots of tobacco dark chocolate and sassafras draped over sweet dark berries and coupled with bold baking spices. Coffee charred oak and more bitter chocolate linger long on the finish. Water serves well to tame the heat. Finished with the addition of ten toasted RC6-profile staves in the barrel."
932,2,"Fragrant lemon and dried herbs on the nose along with a sprinkling of powdered sugar and a hint of licorice. The palate offers deep notes of blackberry compote tiramisu and milk chocolate all underpinned by earthy tones of cedar and polished oak. A rich symphony of flavor punctuates the long impressive finish—mocha almond and cooked dark fruit draped in notes of gooey caramel and pepper spice set against balanced oak."
933,9,"Polished and nicely balanced with caramel as the main note followed by candied fruit soft vanilla sweet corn and nougat. Subtle spice (ginger cinnamon) and gentle oak on the finish round out the sweet notes. Easygoing demeanor and very drinkable. Great value too! A very pleasing versatile bourbon. Value Pick."
934,12,"Thanks to its finishing casks there are dried and syrupy fruits on the nose—cherry cordial candies raisins figs—along with sugared pecans maple syrup candied ginger and leather. That finishing asserts itself even more strongly on the palate which is fruity and sweet becoming better integrated with water: cherries blackberry and raspberry jams figs raisins pecans milk chocolate ginger white pepper and coffee bean. Incredible length on the finish with more dried fruit leather hazelnuts ginger and white pepper. (1974 bottles)"
935,2,"A blend of straight bourbons from Tennessee Kentucky and Indiana aged 9 to 15 years. Wild herbs dried apricots and red fruits punctuate the nose while the palate is smooth but complex offering spice and refined sweetness along with notes of tobacco leaf graphite semi-sweet chocolate and dried red fruit. The finish is lengthy led by dark berry flavors and followed by undernotes of chocolate toasted almonds and baking spice."
936,2,"Larceny’s barrel proof expression released in three batches annually (January May and September) is a treat worth waiting for. A fragrant herbal nose offers notes of fennel dark chocolate peppermint and light coconut. The palate is notably smooth with flavors of chocolate cooked dark fruit black pepper and generous spice all underpinned by balanced oak. Water smooths it out even more bringing out candied orange pepper spice and bitter chocolate."
937,12,"The nose is fruity and deep with cherry cough drop grape candy strawberry jam buttered pecans iced tea dusty baking spice and a hint of tobacco barn; water brings out fresher fruit plus toasted grain and brown sugar. Mouth-filling and chewy the palate has dimension and more berries and cherries sweet with syrup; water focuses the profile on nuts and chocolate. The finish has peppery oak chocolate-covered coffee bean and nuts with quickly fading dark fruit."
938,12,"On the nose figs nuts and integrated spice mingle with caramel-swirl brownie and tobacco barn; candy apple and grape Kool-Aid emerge with water. The palate has nutty sweet savory and spicy flavors in abundance: dark chocolate-covered mint Cherry Coke cinnamon pepper allspice roasted pecans maple syrup and polished oak. It’s consistent into the finish which has cinnamon black pepper mint dark chocolate and lengthy varnish. Seamless to the last and for a whiskey this mature no water is necessary. (2500 bottles)"
939,9,"Silky smooth. Lush honey notes married with bright orchard fruit and candied tropical fruit. Soft vanilla mint and cinnamon round out the palate. Seamless and perilously drinkable. Proof that a bourbon doesn’t have to be old high in alcohol or expensive to be good. Editor's Choice & Value Pick"
940,9,"A soothing bourbon with maple syrup blackberry preserve polished leather roasted nuts marzipan vanilla toffee dusty dates subtle tobacco and a hint of pedro ximinez sherry. Soft flavorful finish. The oak is kept in check with layered sugars and fruit for balance. The price of admission is steep but this whiskey is very satisfying."
941,9,"Often overlooked by collectors because it’s not as high in alcohol as most of its siblings it’s superior to last year’s release which I felt brandished more oak on the finish than needed. Caramel rhum agricole golden raisin and dried citrus segue into polished oak along with a wisp of honey and cinnamon on the finish. Well rounded and subtly complex. An exceptional bourbon. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2016."
942,9,"This Sazerac 18 year old is now a distinctly separate whiskey after several years of releasing whiskey that had been stored in stainless steel to prevent further aging. It doesn’t have as much of the rye zing as previous releases which may disappoint those hoping for a repeat performance. Still the new release is richer and sweeter which I find attractive. Toffee and molasses yielding to clove mint and cinnamon. Polished leather on the finish cuts through the sweetness. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2016."
943,5,"When complex spice meets complex caramel it makes for a wonderful American whiskey experience. That’s exactly what happens here with a cadre of baking spices over fruit such as cinnamon baked apples nutmeg sprinkled over pears and peaches dusted with clove followed by butterscotch vanilla custard and crème brûlée. The balanced and brilliant finish stays true to its complexity."
944,5,"It packs a beautiful nose with arcs of chocolate vanilla wafer cherry caramelized brown sugar baked pears crème brûlée being torched and coconut. These notes become concentrated and are complemented by cola tobacco spice toffee and pepper. Then hazelnut and vanilla coat the mouth sitting there for a couple of minutes until the end—a supremely long finish. What complexity!"
945,12,"Peanut lovers pour yourself a glass of this: It’s multi-dimensional where legumes are concerned. Peanut shells spiced peanuts dry-roasted peanuts—they’re all here interspersed with fresh mint cinnamon iced tea and tobacco barn. There are tingly spices—black pepper and dried chiles—on the palate along with black tea and peppermint. The mouthwatering finish is generously oaky with persistent spice and nuts."
976,12,"Scan the dessert case and choose your favorite because they’re all here in abundance: cake donuts sticky buns pralines cocoa-dusted truffles and strawberry tarts on the nose. Espresso tea and spice notes add some gravitas to the palate which is chewy and oak forward but dark fruit milk chocolate and sweet pecans and peanuts maintain balance. The finish is a dream lengthy and well-developed with nutmeg chai spice toasted oak tea leaf milk chocolate and boysenberry."
946,5,"Whoa...this sherry-finished bourbon offers an up front impression you don’t find in American whiskey: marzipan meets ground-up raw almonds sprinkled over pistachio gelato. Then caramel nuanced cinnamon delicate vanilla and a slight hint of campfire smoke. It’s supremely complex with the third layer being honey dried apricot dried pear figs and prunes over a sublime nuttiness and rich caramel. The finish lingers with salted-caramel cashew. If this is the future of barrel-finished American whiskey let there be more. (Jack Rose Dining Saloon private selection)"
947,12,"Grape Kool-Aid cherry cola blueberries tea leaf walnuts ginger and polished oak lead the nose and carry into the chewy full palate. This whiskey shows its maturity with well-integrated spice semi-sweet chocolate Concord grape jelly and roasted nuts all in sync with undulating oak. Warmth builds into the finish as cooked dark fruits and dark chocolate melt slowly away to reveal black pepper and ginger on a bed of polished oak."
948,5,"From rickhouse G floor 5 barrel 136 is a study in caramel. Layered in crème brûlée salted-caramel cupcake caramel brownie caramel apple fritters caramel popcorn and the classic caramel chew. Then complexity: chocolate truffles nutmeg-dusted hot bananas ginger ice cream cinnamon-candied almonds and warm povitica. It’s so creamy so rich and so unrelenting with masterful flavor that the powerfully long and caramel-forward finish is expected. Splendid must-have sipper. (Lincoln Road Package Store exclusive)"
949,8,"The confectionary nose of flan and crème caramel comes draped over lovely grainy aromas of warm porridge and pastry crust. Vinous notes of cherry/berry fruit emerge along with toasted almonds and floral aromas. On the palate there is berry coulis Creamsicle stick French burnt peanut candies and warm banana. Overall this demonstrates both nice maturity and lovely balance of sweetness and spice with a finish of cinnamon-sprinkled apple pie."
950,12,"Intense flavorful and lush. The nose has roasted chestnuts coconut shavings leather butterscotch carrot cake candied nuts maple syrup and pastry cream. It’s well-textured and drenched in flavor: blackberry jam dark chocolate mint oil maple syrup roasted nuts root beer clove white pepper toasted coconut and cherry cough drops. Wet walnuts oak and lingering intensity on the finish. Add water to unlock more spice and fruit and give it plenty of time to develop."
951,9,"Soft sweet and very smooth. Richly textured layers of caramel toffee vanilla fudge nougat maple syrup and rhum agricole. Blackberry date nut bread cinnamon subtle cocoa and nutmeg add complexity. Clean polished and perilously drinkable. A delicious wheated bourbon! (Not quite the complexity of the 2009 William Larue Weller (a benchmark wheated bourbon which I rated a 96) but getting close."
952,8,"Typical of Booker’s this bourbon shows lots of concentration and muscle oozing with caramel and maple syrup with hints of lavender and bouquet garni. Flavors explode on the palate with more herbal complexity root beer barrel candy green almond black cherry and a big rush of dark bitter-sweet burnt sugar and caramel. Lovely baking spices and lots of toasty oak linger on the long finish. The youngest barrel in the blend is just over 6 years 2 months of age. Editors’ Choice"
953,12,"A scrumptious nose with PayDay candy bar honey on toast crème brûlée cherry fruit leather creamed corn root beer and horehound candy paves the way for the robust flavors that unfold on the palate: cherry Coke roasted peanuts earthy oak and layers of spices. You can taste the age here encased in complex balance a chewy texture and pleasingly high proof. 144 bottles"
954,9,"Crisp clove cool mint cinnamon and cocoa mingle with glazed orange honeyed vanilla caramel and maple syrup. Polished oak and leather on the finish balance the sweet fruity notes. More oak and dried spice when compared to the 2013 release (our American Whiskey of the Year) and while not quite reaching that caliber (it’s not quite as seamless drinkable or complex) it gets close. Very impressive."
955,12,"The limited-edition releases from Four Roses are always top-notch but this bourbon—a permanently available addition to the lineup—proves itself every bit the equal of its rarer brethren. Made with the distillery’s F yeast strain among others it has a perfumed nose with orange blossom cedar chest berries spearmint tobacco leaves sassafras licorice and layers of earthy spice. The palate is consistent and deep with flavors of cherry Coke cough syrup orange oil leathery dark fruit black pepper chili flakes and chocolate shifting into a minty finish replete with pepper cinnamon dark chocolate cooked berries and roasted walnuts. Full rich and utterly satisfying. Number 3 in the 2019 Top 20"
956,2,"Powdered sugar vanilla frosting and other bakery shop notes on the nose as well as leather iced tea dark chocolate cherries and plums. The palate offers spiced chocolate toasted almonds cinnamon pepper vanilla cream and well-integrated oak. The finish is spicy and powerful with semi-sweet chocolate raisins walnuts leather and pipe tobacco. A big whiskey that carries its proof remarkably well—savory and sweet but with subtlety and balance. Editors' Choice"
957,9,"This is what I wish the standard Maker’s Mark would be: more mature spicier more complex and with a richer finish. Caramel kissed with honey provides a base for marzipan cotton candy cinnamon clove and a balancing leather dryness on the finish."
958,12,"An enchanting and somewhat racy nose with blackberries cherries concord grapes brown sugar apple crumble leather iced tea and polished oak; though the port finish is evident it doesn’t smother the bourbon’s core character which comes through with corn muffin and peanuts. Nutty grain asserts itself on the palate as well set off by dark fruit and chocolate ample spice pecan pie and cherry cough syrup. The lengthy finish is peppery and pops with chocolate cough syrup roasted pecans and warm spices. (14000 bottles) Collectibles"
959,12,"Vanilla nougat violet candies maple syrup blueberry jam root beer spiced peanuts iced tea and rich cooked fruit on the nose. Creamy and nutty on the palate with milk chocolate bitter orange Coca-Cola roasted pecans blackberry jam and lush silky spice. The lengthy full finish showcases a panoply of spice—none of it hot—along with cooked cherries dark chocolate and leathery oak. Excellent construction and balance of flavors; no water needed."
960,2,"A rich and fragrant nose of mince pie baking spices figs cherry pie sweetened ice tea candle wax and an earthy note of warehouse floor. The palate is dense and chewy with rich flavors of chocolate-covered raspberries cooked cherries honeyed almonds licorice and black tea. Water unlocks more fruit notes spice and a hint of café au lait. The finish is lengthy offering dark chocolate allspice licorice and balanced oak."
1010,2,"A nose of cherry peppermint vanilla frosting pound cake buttered toast cherries cola peanut shells rye seed and old warehouse. The palate is big and powerful yet smooth and sophisticated. It’s chewy and spicy with chocolate fudge peanuts white pepper fresh cherries bitter espresso leather and old oak. There’s great length on a finish of chocolate cocoa powder raspberry cigar box and baking spice. Toasty and delicious; a tour de force."
961,8,"Poor Baker Beam great-nephew of Jim Beam. His eponymous Baker’s bourbon ended up a sleeper bottle alongside rightfully lauded Booker’s bourbon and stellar limited editions of Knob Creek. But this year Baker’s has reason to boast as it gets the single-barrel treatment. It will remain 107 proof and a minimum of 7 years old. However the addition of details like barreling date age warehouse and barrel number will make for fun treasure hunting. Our bottle offered a lush palate of blackberries delicious dried fruits licorice and cinnamon. Number 16 in the 2019 Top 20"
962,12,"Pleasantly earthy cellar floor and cola spices weight the sweet aromas of butterscotch ripple ice cream cherry pie blackberry cobbler and chocolate chip-blueberry pancakes. There’s equal breadth on the palate with its well-integrated flavors spanning dark chocolate and roasted peanuts lemon peel and leathery fruit skins and savory-sweet oak. The finish is savory with coffee and roasted pecans lifted by white pepper and dried ginger and lengthened almost infinitely by savory oak. (1309 bottles)"
963,12,"Much to unpack on this well-structured bourbon starting with the complex nose of gingerbread spices dark chocolate leather book bindings roasted pecans blackberry and raspberry preserves and decadent brown sugar. The palate is tightly wound and needs patience to fully reveal its manifold flavors that range from dried cherries and roasted peanuts to lemon and orange peel integrated baking spice and marshmallow. It’s tied off neatly with chocolate-covered peanuts citrus peel and sweet oak."
964,12,"The port casks give an arresting nose of saline like a tidal pool but rich with raisins figs hazelnuts brown sugar and orange peel. Tart yuzu appears a curiosity but not unwelcome. The full-bodied palate is spicy rich sweet and nutty resplendent with baking spice brown sugar Coca-Cola dark chocolate candied orange peel fig jam and toasted pecans and hazelnuts. Gingersnaps Italian hot chocolate brown sugar-encrusted pecans and polished oak on the finish."
965,12,"Coca-Cola rich spice dark chocolate roasted walnuts licorice root maple syrup Luxardo cherries and varnish on the nose. Without water the palate is chewy and full of puckering tannins; add a few drops to unleash dark chocolate candied ginger cooked berries tea leaf walnuts in maple syrup black pepper and a hint of orange oil. The lengthy finish offers chocolate-covered cherries black tea leaves and white pepper. Layered and engaging. Editors' Choice"
966,12,"Heady perfume of violets fresh blueberries purple plums blackberry jam and raspberry coulis along with grape soda antique furniture wet walnuts and a hint of toasted marshmallow. Equally enchanting on the palate with candied violets grape juice and refined oak; add water and the fresh fruits burst forth rich and jammy underpinned by peppery spice dark chocolate pecans and more violets. It ends with rich restraint lengthy and mouthwatering. (748 bottles)"
967,9,"The most underrated of the five in the 2011 collection but this year’s release (like last year’s) is very lovely bourbon. Perhaps just a bit softer than last year but with a similar profile: very even keeled and nicely balanced with sweet notes (vanilla toffee añejo rum) peppered with soft orchard fruit and spice (cocoa cinnamon nutmeg hint of mint) polished oak and subtle tobacco."
968,12,"Elegant and supple as befits a whiskey aged 11 years. The maturity shows on the nose which has Concord grape skins leather sassafras iced tea chocolate pecans and varnish. Big dark fruit flavors cola spices ginger cooked cherries dark chocolate and generous oak; a touch of water brings out pecans. The lengthy finish draws out cola dark chocolate leather and pepper. Sip slowly; it continues to evolve in the glass. (13200 bottles) Collectibles"
969,12,"Originally touted by Booker Noe the “Kentucky Chew” is a way of tasting whiskey: swishing it around your mouth then swallowing and smacking your lips—an urge that’s hard to resist with this intensely flavorful bourbon. Aromas of peanuts cherry cola candied ginger blackberry jam and curing tobacco are echoed on the palate which has grape jelly blueberry pie peanuts in Coke Mexican hot chocolate and a hint of licorice. The finish is warming lengthy and sweet with a lift of cherry and spice undercutting chocolate and oak."
970,9,"The only setback from last year’s Antique Collection release when I rated it an 84 because it was showing too much wood (especially compared to the 2007-2008 releases). The 2010 release is back on track with great balance and showing very traditional notes of vanilla toffee rummy molasses dusty corn soft summer fruit and a sprinkling of spice (cinnamon mint cocoa) with oak resin to balance out the sweet notes. (Editor's Choice)"
971,9,"I’ve tasted several batches of this whiskey (made at the old Stitzel-Weller distillery) from the inaugural Batch #1 when it was a 17 year old to this new release. It’s not surprising that they taste progressively older. My favorite is still the first batch but this whiskey holds up nicely and shows a similar flavor profile with a bit more wood influence: blackberry jam nutty toffee nougat creamy vanilla cinnamon and a touch of polished oak on the finish. Nice texture too with good viscosity and grip on the finish."
972,9,"Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey finished in a port pipe. This is veteran master distiller Lincoln Henderson’s newest creation and it’s a beauty. Richly textured silky and well-rounded with ripe berried fruits candied tangerine light toffee maple syrup and creamy vanilla sprinkled with spice (cinnamon hint of mint). Smooth silky finish and dangerously drinkable! The port pipe notes dovetail perfectly. Lovely just the way it is but it’s begging for a cigar. My only gripe: why not 45 or 50% ABV? But I’m splitting hairs. I really enjoy this stuff!"
973,9,"Elegant clean and peppered with dried spice notes throughout (cinnamon nutmeg allspice). Additional notes of barrel char vanilla wafer summer fruits caramel corn maple syrup and candied almond add complexity. Begins sweet but dries out nicely on the finish inviting another sip. Very nice!"
974,2,"The second release in Angel’s Envy’s Cellar Collection this one features 10 year old bourbon finished 10 months in tawny port casks. Pleasant oak and barrel char on the nose underpin playful notes of strawberry cotton candy and raisins. The palate is rich with chocolate-covered mint figs and orange. Polished oak bitter chocolate red fruits and blackberry punctuate the finish. A touch of water brings on a burst of flavors. (5400 bottles)"
975,12,"A sack of dried corn and a basket of roasted peanuts go hand in hand with iced tea Coca-Cola dark berries caramel and earthy clay barn floor. Unsurprisingly brawny and chewy in the mouth it’s packed with dark chocolate-covered peanuts cola cooked cherries chocolate tart and tingling spice that carries well into the finish which also keeps up the dark fruit and peanut flavors."
1044,8,"Driven by lovely maple syrup and sweet bread pudding this is like waltzing into a bake shop serving up warm sticky buns—all bready sweet spice and dried raisins—laced with toasted oak. The body is delightfully rich and viscous with a generous jolt of sweetness and spice that pours long and satisfying. The sweet maple candied nuts dried berries and white pepper spice strike a wonderful balance."
977,8,"The nose is a bit tight reluctantly giving up brown sugar on warm cereal dried banana chips honey peanuts and figgy dried fruits. The palate comes across really dense and chewy with dark berries and sweet prune notes laced with licorice and cinnamon spice. The dark fruit flavors feel lush and decadent while drying oak lends lovely maturity and polish. As Baker’s is now a single-barrel product your experience may vary with each bottle although the proof will remain the same."
978,8,"The chewy caramel aroma is bursting with all types of vanilla—frosted birthday cake Nilla wafer and pudding—along with honey-roasted peanuts and dark berry. On the palate deep fruit and an explosion of spice flavors including nutmeg cinnamon and cloves. For all its power this whiskey remains impressively sippable although it shows a more elegant side with some water added. A blend of 9 year old Knob Creek and Basil Hayden’s 11 year old Booker’s and 12 year old Baker’s bourbons bottled at barrel proof and unfiltered."
979,2,"The first of Old Fitzgerald’s semiannual releases for 2019. The nose offers vanilla flan banana cream pie and powdered sugar but is also floral with tropical notes of peach coconut and melon all draped lightly in tobacco leaf. The palate is gentle with maple syrup marshmallow milk chocolate ripe peach coconut orange and oak. A rich finish offers honey chocolate almond toasted oak and a hint of cigar. A pleasurable progression of flavors. Collectible"
980,9,"Richer and fuller when compared to the Standard Stave Drying Time variant in this Experimental Collection. Sweeter too with creamy layers of vanilla and caramel. The extended drying time influence tames the dried spice and oak resin and is proof that extended stave aging really benefits older bourbons that might otherwise be dominated by oak. Sadly with whiskey in such demand I doubt many bourbon producers will take the time to age the staves longer. Price per 375 ml."
981,9,"No age statement on the label but aged for 8 1/2 years. Bottled at the same ABV as its entry proof into the barrel. Lush and mouth-coating. A pleasingly sweet bourbon with caramel nougat and chewy toffee mixed with ripe orchard fruit golden raisin and creamy vanilla. Soothing finish. A wonderful way to end a meal. (With a cigar perhaps?) This is a beautiful bourbon and a great value given its quality ABV and price."
982,5,"Think caramel bomb. Once you pass the crème brûlée caramel chew and other variations of the confectionary vanilla custard pumpkin toasted pecan raisins light German chocolate cake praline tobacco cigar box sandalwood and earth surface. It’s mouth-coating covering every inch tingling from the palate’s roof to the back of the neck. The incredibly long finish sits there with caramel. The only knock here is that caramel can be overwhelming but it’s also bourbon’s staple note. (New Hampshire only)"
983,5,"Think of walking in a prairie meadow at a state fair the wind curving slight hints of grain and then an explosion of cotton candy marshmallow and florals. Initial earth turns to powerful notes of smoked paprika maple salted caramel and fried bread. Every note is pronounced and beautiful. A strong and long finish follows with an amalgamation of everything tasted and then cinnamon appears out of nowhere. (Kentucky only)"
984,9,"A blend of 7 and 12 year old bourbons married in new toasted barrels. Vanilla caramel-coated berries orchard fruit cinnamon soft mint and teasing toasted coconut-spiked chocolate. Dry spicy oak finish. Nicely integrated. Excellent combination of youth and maturity."
985,12,"Peanuts in the shell corn silo baking spice Lipton’s tea bag brown sugar blueberry Pop Tart and Dr. Pepper on the nose and a touch of solvent that reveals maturity. The chewy palate’s blueberry muffin and grape jelly combine seamlessly with peanuts and milk chocolate. Water brings out a sheen of citrus oil but bruises the fullness of flavor; use sparingly. A rounded finish of oak dark chocolate and integrated spice leaves nothing but satisfaction. (Collectible)"
986,9,"Aged in Zinfandel barrels for eight years after spending six years in new charred oak. Intriguing spice (mint cocoa cinnamon) along with molasses roasted nuts and delicately textured fruit (blackberry boysenberry). Nice interplay between the fruit sweet notes and dried spice which emerges on the second half of the palate."
987,11,"Rich multi-layered nose: vanilla cornmeal berries (black raspberries wineberries) and broad-shouldered oak. Powerful but not overproof hot in the mouth; controlled. The berries sing a high counter-melody over the corn-oak beat as the whole experience rocks along. It’s powerful sweet authoritative and finishes with a reprise of it all: berries corn vanilla and stronger oak. Mature complete bourbon with a 7 year age statement and a real sleeper in the Small Batch Collection."
988,9,"Back after a three-year hiatus. Well-rounded with lovely caramel creamy vanilla toasted oak nougat and candied fruit along with a peppering of cinnamon and subtle mint. Pleasant lingering finish. Great structure with seamless flavors."
989,9,"This year’s 1995 Vintage is another delicious treat. It is one of the most richly textured bottlings of the past ten vintages and its flavors meld seamlessly combining layers of creamy sweetness (chewy toffee butterscotch and a touch of corn) spice (mint vanilla cinnamon) polished oak vibrant fruit and a dusting of cocoa and nutmeg."
990,9,"Amber color. This particular bottling (and remember that single barrel bottlings vary slightly from one to another) expresses a potpourri of spices accentuated with honey tones toffee oaky vanilla and a hint of fruit. The flavors are perfectly balanced."
991,5,"Bright and pronounced caramel in many forms from rich caramel chews to caramel pudding. Then a spice backbone jumps out followed by butterscotch brown sugar vanilla wafers jalapeño cornbread mustard seeds and peach cobbler. A drop of water makes it even more complex with savory spices—sage dried parsley and a hint of rosemary meeting sweet: more vanilla and butterscotch. With or without water it finishes long and strong with a hint of pepper."
992,5,"Absolutely stellar opening with blueberries black currants and mashed cherries complementing vanilla icing cornbread and chocolate-hazelnut wafers. Then it’s salt water taffy bread pudding honey jalapeño poppers and snickerdoodles. But it does not stop there: baking spices develop toward the end with bright cinnamon notes coating the long finish. (Barrel No. 5083254 reviewed; 12000 bottles)"
993,9,"Nicely round flavor profile with complex notes of creamy vanilla subtle tropical fruit mocha fennel seed and light tobacco. Lingering cinnamon spice and cocoa on the finish. An extremely drinkable whiskey that entertains throughout. Price is per 375 ml."
1011,5,"A wonderful beginning of floral fruit leather and oak notes; the start to a truly sensational whiskey. Its round caramel meets florals stone fruit honeysuckle and dried apricot with hints of dark chocolate pear and raw almonds not far behind. But this whiskey is about the spice from pepper to baking spices; they wander the palate and walk you down a long and lovely finish with a hint of cinnamon apple."
994,12,"An unconventional tart aroma overlays the dark jammy fruit baking spices Coca-Cola leather and dark chocolate-covered almonds of the nose and it carries through to the palate which has a ponzu-like character: citrus and umami. There’s also dark chocolate ample spice roasted nuts tobacco and dried apricots all held together on a full-bodied chewy mouthfeel. Excellent length on the finish with savory oak dark chocolate nuts and persistent spice—and that unusual tart flavor. Quirky and delightful."
995,8,"Oak corn sweetness and tropical fruit collide in this powerful bourbon that suggests grilled pineapple and charred corn on the cob. It handles the proof well but be prepared for a no-holds-barred tongue lashing of licorice bitter citrus pith and oak before a heaping spoonful of butterscotch pudding quells the heat. Reveals even more flavor with water—blueberry muffin clove-studded orange and cedar shingle."
996,2,"From Bardstown Bourbon Co.’s very creative Collaborative Series—this one finished in oloroso sherry casks used by Louisville’s Copper & Kings to age its brandy. Mocha oak char roasted coffee beans grilled herbs leather orange peel and dried raspberries on the nose. The palate melds baked apple more herbs grilled meats and pleasant oak. Raspberry and orange ride atop a bed of spice bitter chocolate and coffee to the finish."
997,9,"The star of the portfolio. A true sipping whisky with elegance and grace. Perhaps the best Tennessee whisky on the market. Honey-soaked corn bread rhum agricole ripe nectarine and glazed citrus. Hint of mint green tea and cinnamon. Very polished."
998,2,"A delightful mélange of flavors on the nose—new leather orange peel angel food cake orange Creamsicle cooked peaches sweetened ice tea dark chocolate nutmeg and allspice. A well-structured full-bodied palate starts with earthy notes of warehouse and then lets fly with flavors of blackberry tart nutmeg pepper and semi-sweet chocolate. A lighter but superbly balanced finish adds more dark chocolate roasted pecans cherry tobacco pepper and beautifully integrated oak."
999,9,"A single barrel offering to celebrate Distillery Manager Jim Rudtledge’s 40 years in the industry. Dry botanical and teasingly complex with bright fruit crisp spice and complex oak. Its dryness is prevalent throughout-the maturity is evident-but never excessively so and there’s always a soft interplay of honey and vanilla. A very elegant whiskey."
1000,2,"The 20th release of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon from 95 barrels filled in 2010 and aged 10 years. Light earthiness dried herbs and leather on the nose with notes of black cherry and mint. The palate is surprisingly delicate but rich with flavors of apple blackberry dark chocolate cake mocha butterscotch and aged oak. More earthiness mixes with spice on the finish followed by buttered pecans chocolate syrup caramel and balanced oak."
1001,9,"A fuller-bodied sweeter encounter than Barrel #55-6F reviewed below. More rounded and even-keeled throughout too! Chewy toffee rummy molasses and nougat with underlying notes of dark berried fruit accentuating spice and supple leather. The heavyweight of the group."
1002,9,"These Stagg releases are becoming legendary. This one while not the best of the bottlings maintains the Stagg reputation. When compared with the earlier release in 2005 this Stagg expresses a shade less oak. It’s also more subtle and creamier on the palate. It’s clean superbly balanced and very drinkable-even at higher strengths. Light toffee maple syrup and caramel corn provide a bed of sweetness. Layered on top are notes of candied fruit crisp mint vanilla and polished oak. Soft finish. Just don’t add too much water to it because the flavors seem to lose their cohesiveness at lower strengths. Drink this whiskey at a strength higher than you normally would to fully appreciate it."
1003,9,"The newest member of the portfolio and worth every penny. It’s the distillery’s ""super-premium"" offering produced in small batches and (for now anyway) small quantities. It is my favorite of the three Dickels from a pure taste perspective with a lushness roundness sophistication and grace not often seen in a bourbon or Tennessee whiskey. All of the flavors of the other two Dickels are in here and they’re in perfect balance and very tight. (Note: my review was from the first bottling which was a rectangular-shaped bottle with white lettering. There has since been a second bottling which I have not yet tasted.)"
1004,9,"The fourth release (and best so far) in Diageo’s Orphan Barrel series. This bourbon was distilled at what was then called the George T. Stagg distillery (now Buffalo Trace) and spent the last several years maturing at Stitzel-Weller. It’s nicely balanced and not over-oaked with spice (clove cinnamon) oak resin and leather along with sweet notes (honeyed fruit soft vanilla coconut custard) and a nice creamy texture. Better than most 20-plus year old bourbons on the market."
1005,9,"Buffalo Trace distilled a wheated bourbon and aged barrels from the same distillation date on three different floors (1 5 and 9) for 12 ½ years to see what the differences would be. This is similar to an experiment they conducted last year using a rye mashbill bourbon. As you will see the higher the floor the more intense the flavors and the greater the wood influence.

Darker more intense and mysterious in personality when compared to its two siblings. Notes of barrel char roasted nuts polished oak and tobacco peppered with dried spice. Fortunately sweet notes of toffee maple syrup and caramel stand up to the dry notes and provide balance. Price is per 375 ml."
1006,12,"The nose shows great maturity with varnish leather couch black cherry syrup dark chocolate and wet walnuts. There’s a pleasant tartness to the palate like just-ripe cherries along with the richness of chocolate torte blackberry jam birch syrup Concord grape jelly and leathery oak. It finishes with lengthy cherry syrup high-end dark chocolate and more varnish and leather. Editor's Choice"
1007,9,"Thirteen years old but it shows its age nicely. It’s peppered with complex dried spice notes (mint cinnamon ginger vanilla)
yet it also has interwoven sweet notes (maple syrup caramel honey) to keep the whiskey from being too dry. Hints of dark chocolate and berried fruit add complexity. Dry spicy tobacco and leather-tinged finish. Great complexity!"
1008,8,"Aromas of oak dried fruit and horse saddle set up for a sucker punch of leather boxing glove from this big and brawny bourbon. But it also dances with grace tickling the tongue with sweet spices dark bitter chocolate and wisps of tobacco. Intriguing notes of horehound cocoa-dusted almonds and baked apples are lip-smacking good and it handles water well revealing ever more depth."
1009,12,"Using six of the distillery’s ten recipes including the V yeast strain that imparts delicate fruit notes—here presenting as Pixy Stix Rocket Pops and cherry pie—and the F yeast strain that offers herbal notes like licorice root earthy tea leaf and root beer. There’s also orange blossom pecans cedar chest and tobacco. Aromas and flavors unfold in layers with rich oak roasted pecans and vanilla whipped cream juxtaposed against peppery spice blueberry-cinnamon crumble and sweet tea. Water reveals new depths."
1012,12,"Some whiskies reveal their maturity with just one whiff and this is one of them with notes of varnish and mothballs along with cooked dark fruits—cherries blackberries blueberries—sassafras root beer and rich spices. More maturity is revealed on the palate which is tannic but not dry and viscous showing off blackberry cobbler brandied cherries pecans roasted peanuts cracked pepper and ginger. An excellent lengthy finish that draws out the fruity rich spice and practically demands a cigar."
1013,2,"A nose of confectioners’ sugar and peach tart as well as Toblerone cherry cola roasted almonds barrel char leather and drying oak. More baking spice on the palate melding with chocolate syrup savory notes of roasted nuts and charred corn pepper and perfumed oak. Earthy notes emerge with water along with spice and chocolate. An herbal finish offers flavors of cherry tart light chocolate and spice. Very tasty and with plenty of panache."
1014,9,"Amber mahogany. Rich mature aromas of vanilla cinnamon leather teaberry coconut and dark fruit-very complex indeed. Big coating soothing texture. Flavors are very mature rounded and nicely balanced with notes of molasses dried fruit cinnamon and teaberry. It finishes long with a very soothing demeanor."
1015,2,"Dried herbs and tobacco and then a fragrant rush of fresh cherries caramel Klondike bar orange Creamsicle clove sweet black licorice straps and sweetened ice tea. The sweeter notes rule on the nose while the palate is balanced with spice and bold with notes of orange tart vanilla ice cream and black pepper. More balanced sweetness on a thick finish that’s rich in flavors of coconut baking spice angel food cake and vanilla frosting."
1016,9,"Beautifully balanced like Kentucky Vintage but more complex and with greater depth. It’s also not as boldly dry as Pure Kentucky XO. Rather it is softer and more seductive. This is splendid bourbon! It would be a shame to adulterate this bourbon in any way-don’t even think of mixing it. Find yourself a quiet moment pour yourself a measure and savor."
1017,9,"Style: Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey Color: Deep amber Aroma: Deep very mature dry and spicy (especially spearmint) with underlying notes of ripe fruit polished oak and leather. The aroma is so thick you almost need a knife to cut through it. Palate: Rich thick and chewy in texture-sweeter up front then drying out towards its finish. Rather bold in flavors that are identical to its aroma but never overpowering. Soothing satisfying finish that seems to linger on forever."
1018,9,"Notes of ""rummy"" molasses Sugar Daddies red currant citrus peel sandalwood polished leather and vanilla cream. Subtle teasing black licorice and brittle mint emerge from time to time. Well-balanced with all the flavors sharing the limelight. A beautiful example of mature bourbon."
1019,12,"Swirls with the smells of a county fair—candy apples peanuts caramel spiced cookies and old barn boards redolent with maturity and complexity. More childhood favorites appear on the palate: cinnamon Red Hots grape soda blackberry candy chocolate-covered caramels candy apple and roasted corn with lush oak rounding out into a peppery finish of cherry cola and roasted pecans. Given the barrel proof this takes water well. Nelson’s Green Brier Distillery bottles the Belle Meade line of bourbons sourced from MGP Distillery. Each batch of Cask Strength Reserve averages around 1000 bottles; ABV varies between 55% and 60%. Number 10 in the 2018 Top 20"
1020,8,"While this offers no age statement it revels in the renewed respect for bottled in bond whiskey which assures us it is at least 4 years old 100 proof from one distillery and one distilling season. This new appreciation is for good reason. Toasted oak chocolate-covered banana vanilla and apple meet hints of coffee and cinnamon on the nose. The high-rye recipe delivers the requisite cracked pepper and baking spices on the caramel-laden palate laced with licorice. This widely available bourbon seems to dwell in the age sweet spot is nicely balanced with oak and comes at a price that leaves little cause for hesitation. Number 9 in the 2018 Top 20"
1021,5,"A combination of 7 to 12 year old ryed bourbons finished in cabernet sauvignon barrels it’s a caramel lover’s delight. You’ll find fruit in several forms: cherry blackberry black currant juice and strawberry-rhubarb jam. Vanilla lurks throughout followed by buttered cinnamon popcorn apple pie filling nutmeg and caramel-drizzled bread pudding. Each pronounced note combines for a savory ride to a long lasting and delightful finish. A necessity for barrel-finish fans."
1022,5,"At 6 years 4 months and 6 days this is beautiful. Honey cinnamon and marzipan are the opening trifecta preparing you for roasted-nut wonders: almond walnut and pecan. Then it’s complex crème brûlée balsamic vinaigrette salted caramel molasses maple syrup and hints of toasted pine nuts leather and anise. With an eyedropper of water it becomes a caramel bomb. In both cases long finishes await with hints of caramel."
1023,8,"An intriguing nose features cherry cough drop and horehound with hints of mint crushed herbs and dried flowers. The palate crackles with candied peanuts lush spices—pepper and allspice—and oozes with some molten licorice. The oak-driven finish shows exquisite maturity while keeping the wood in check."
1024,5,"Availability and quality are two words that you don’t often hear in conjunction with new American whiskeys. But Rebel Yell 10 year old Single Barrel scores on both counts. The 2017 release presents stellar caramel and vanilla notes then pure bliss striking powerful mouth-coating notes of crème brûlée with a beautiful pecan pie note on the finish. Since these are single barrels flavors may vary by bottle; no two barrels yield identical flavors. However Rebel Yell 10 year old has come pretty close to a house style and that sort of consistent excellence in a single barrel whiskey is an achievement in itself. Did we mention it’s available? Number 12 in the 2017 Top 20"
1025,8,"This is heaped with toasty oak notes of wood shavings and nutty-sweet butter pecan ice cream. There’s a touch of herbal antiseptic and tarragon but it’s kept in check letting the caramel sweetness and baked marshmallow permeate the palate. Water unleashes dark cherry and candied peanuts. A really well-balanced whiskey with sweetness spice and fruit working in harmony."
1026,2,"Fragrant oak on the nose along with powdered sugar vanilla fudge cherry pie and accents of orange peel and leather. The palate offers notes of orange Creamsicle pepper dried oranges and cigar wrapper. The finish is a long ride of spice and chocolate-covered almonds melding with cooked fruit notes of orange and black cherry as well as cracked pepper. A robust whiskey that carries its heft gracefully and offers balanced complexity."
1027,2,"A pleasantly oily nose rich with botanical notes orange peel black licorice straps herbs vanilla frosting and macaroons. The palate is sweet with tropical notes of pineapple and mango grapefruit dried apricots and gentle spice. A lengthy finish offers lemon cream pie vanilla cream light pepper and tobacco ending with a hint of bitter chocolate. A very unusual bourbon divisive within our tasting panel but also very unique balanced and flavorful."
1028,2,"The nose offers bold notes of cocoa powder brown sugar peanuts licorice cherry pie vanilla ice cream and baking spice. The palate is creamy with chocolate fudge almonds and shortbread along with earthier notes of drying oak old leather and tobacco leaf. Cracked walnuts on the finish along with almonds chocolate toasted oak orange and tea leaves. Lots of sweetness spice and nuttiness all ringed by a hint of black pepper. (12000 bottles)"
1029,12,"New Riff is still too well new to have established “classic” flavors but this bourbon certainly shows consistency with the distillery’s bottled in bond version—amped up here at barrel proof. Almonds and berries lead the nose but it boasts voluminous depth with notes of peanuts iced tea orange blossom tobacco leaf and baking spice. Dark fruit textured spice savory peanuts dark chocolate mint oil orange almond and cherry on the palate; adding water is a good idea. The finish extends all the flavors with seemingly boundless length. Every sip is thrilling."
1030,8,"There’s a bounty of nuts here—almond walnut and pecan—along with vanilla nougat poached pear and some beeswax notes. Initially the palate is citrus-loaded with zesty grapefruit peel and cut orange wedges but it quickly succumbs to drying oak tannins showing a bit of heat as toasty oak bitter chocolate and cinnamon carry the finish. (12500 bottles)"
1031,12,"It’s all about the grain with this whiskey made with two high-rye bourbons and a wheated bourbon. Honey Nut Cheerios strawberry shortcake lemon tart almonds pistachios candied ginger and a touch of coconut cream on the nose. The palate keeps the mashbill in play with sweetness and warm pastry notes but showcases the barrel’s best qualities: chocolate cinnamon and integrated spice. Consistent into the finish which is peppery and warm with cinnamon-laced dark chocolate nuts and toasted cereals. (30600 bottles)"
1032,8,"Richly oaked its maturity is evident in the walnut cigar box burnt sugar toasted marshmallow and waxy furniture polish notes. On the palate it pours rich dense and chewy with sweet treacle balanced against tobacco leaf. Mouth-coating and warming with generous proof figgy fruit and cinnamon on the mid-palate culminating in a finish of bitter chocolate and fine wood tannins. (2600 bottles)"
1033,2,"Candied cherries and oranges on the nose along with a note of fresh blueberry and a blast of cinnamon. Smooth on the front palate with flavors of cinnamon gum cooked dark berries old leather and dunnage warehouse floor. Water brings out chocolate and vanilla as well as dark fruits and white pepper. A lengthy finish offers savory herbs bitter chocolate fresh coffee beans and roasted walnuts. Great texture and well-balanced throughout."
1034,12,"Grain takes pride of place here with kettle corn honey peanuts and corn muffin on the nose as well as milk chocolate licorice root blueberry jam cinnamon allspice and brown sugar. More sweet grain and nuts on the palate along with blueberry fresh ginger cinnamon and a hint of mint. Add some water to lift the veil on the more subtle flavors. The rounded finish continues with nutty sweetness milk chocolate and well-integrated oak. Excellent balance."
1035,2,"Created by master blender Marianne Eaves for a group led by former NFL star Peyton Manning and tennis great Andy Roddick. Aromas of breakfast cereal bananas dried strawberries leather and integrated oak on the nose and a smooth palate of Grape Nuts allspice bitter chocolate pipe tobacco and earthiness. The finish offers powdered sugar cracked pepper and baking spice. Future releases of Sweetens Cove are planned—very good news indeed. (14000 bottles)"
1036,9,"Aged for 225 months (18 years 9 months). Only 225 bottles available and only at one location: Heaven Hill’s Bourbon Heritage Center in Bardstown KY. This is a lot of money for a bourbon but if you do buy a bottle you’re going to enjoy it. It’s spicy (especially on the nose) with cinnamon bark spearmint and nutmeg. The spice is balanced by an array of sweeter fruit notes (bramble ripe orchard fruits) vanilla custard fig molasses cola and charcoal. Soft on the finish. Very polished and well-balanced. It’s much more mellow when compared to Heaven Hill’s other recent ultra-premium release Parker’s Heritage Collection 27 year old."
1037,5,"Oh boy! Rising rolls cakes baking in the oven whipped cream icing citrus and chocolate fill the nose. Then the palate confirms this tapestry of goodness with vanilla cake batter brown-sugar butter over yeast rolls caramel icing and cinnamon sprinkles. If not for a backbone of beautiful spices layered in between this whiskey stands as a confectionery delight. As it is the velvety structure concentrated notes and long spicy finish make it a must-have sipper."
1038,5,"Rosewater almond extract dark cherries roasted almonds and caramelized sugar start this truly splendid aromatic whiskey. Marzipan pecan pie chocolate Moon Pie Bavarian cream butterscotch and fried dough with powdered sugar follow. This remarkable whiskey finishes long and strong with more fried dough."
1039,5,"Honeysuckle dandelions and roses start this floral superhighway that takes a brief turn toward grain in many forms from baked breads to boiling oats. Then earth and fruit meet for a delightful combination that walks toward the sweeter side with hints of caramel chew vanilla cake batter pecan pie chocolate-covered raisins cassis black currant and povitica. Its long finish introduces a lovely roasted walnut note. (Less than 10000 bottles)"
1040,2,"Cinnamon-baked apples on the nose with ripe banana peach chocolate almond toasted coconut and sassafras. The palate is velvety and gentle with burnt orange strawberry milk chocolate almond white pepper and tobacco leaf. The finish is creamy with milk chocolate drizzled caramel sweet corn brown sugar and leather wrapped in toasted oak. Depth balance and plenty of pizzazz."
1041,12,"On the nose there’s Golden Grahams iced tea and peanuts galore—shelled unshelled even boiled—Cherry Coke white pepper and ginger syrup. More sweet ginger on the palate a lively high note that peps up the cherry cough syrup roasted peanuts cola white pepper and chewy oak. The lengthy finish is full of oak cooked cherry white pepper and roasted nuts. Naturally this does well with water but frankly it’s fine without."
1042,8,"There’s evident age here with dried leaves old suede jacket and dusty oak at the forefront but underlying that maturity is plenty of dried fruit figs and cola. It pours broad and mouth filling exuding both power and grace as it delivers caramel tobacco and a mélange of baking spices—cloves and nutmeg. The solid wood structure and oak tannins are here in abundance but never out of balance."
1043,5,"There’s a lot going on here and it starts in an unusual place—corn specifically corn husk followed by caramel vanilla oak banana pineapple crème brûlée vanilla a hint of cedar cherrywood sautéed porcini mushroom and cinnamon. Over a mouth coating texture the velvety structure drips down the jawline offering butterscotch paprika nutmeg baked apple pie bread pudding caramel chew roasted walnuts and baking spice which lingers over a long finish. Must-have Tennessee whiskey. Price is per liter."
1045,9,"From a single barrel but the barrel number is (unfortunately) not specified. It’s nicely matured deftly balanced and complex with a wide range of fruit layered sweetness and a cabinet full of spice especially mint. Easy to drink—I’m enjoying it immensely without adding any water—and deceptively beautiful; there are no fancy bells or whistles here. Great bourbon honoring a great master distiller."
1046,2,"In 2018 Heaven Hill discontinued its 6 year old bottled in bond bourbon that was sold only in Kentucky but now has roared back with this widely available 7 year old. While the bottled in bond designation isn’t necessarily a quality guarantee this whiskey more than proves its merit. It’s explosive bold and buttery with warm flavors of honey-roasted peanuts caramel chocolate corn muffins licorice and cinnamon all accented by notes of savory herbs cloves white pepper tobacco and an earthy undertone. Well-integrated big oak sweetness and spice combine to create grace power and length. This is pure bourbon bliss at a very approachable price. Number 4 in the 2019 Top 20"
1047,9,"Elegant subtly complex and perilously drinkable. Honey tones dovetail nicely with gentle oak spice and bright fruit. My favorite of the bunch. Very lovely! Price is per 375 ml."
1048,2,"Contract distiller Bardstown Bourbon has begun building its own portfolio of whiskeys and this inaugural release—comprising 60% Bardstown’s own 2 year old bourbon and 40% sourced 11 year old bourbon—is an auspicious debut. Rye and an herbal rush of peppermint and dill greet the nose swathed in cotton candy vanilla cream and nutty caramel. The palate is loaded with chocolate fudge honeyed almonds dark fruits light pepper and allspice. Bitter chocolate espresso orange peel leather and spice complete a sumptuous finish. Number 11 in the 2019 Top 20"
1049,2,"Raspberry tart marzipan honeyed cornbread cinnamon new leather cedar and herbs on the nose. A creamy mouthfeel with notes of chocolate fudge tobacco leaf leather spice and mature oak. Water brings out generous flavors of chocolate nuttiness licorice cinnamon spearmint and mature but balanced oak. Spiced and lively particularly considering its age. (146 bottles)"
1050,2,"Raspberry cobbler candied watermelon rind caramel peanuts and violets on the nose. The palate is earthy and malty balanced against sweeter notes of Juicy Fruit gum cherry cola and semi-sweet chocolate. Water brings out spice along with caramel brown sugar and generous oak influence. On the finish toasted oak is balanced against notes of raspberry jam and chocolate-covered strawberries. Pleasant and luscious with pronounced but balanced spice."
1051,12,"Cherry Coke and grape soda blackberry and raspberry preserves ginger molasses cookies hot cocoa mix iced tea and cough syrup on the complex nose which has a weighty character. The palate is light-bodied by comparison but still deeply enticing with Concord grapes mint leaves blackberry cobbler toasted nuts cherry cough syrup cacao nibs and herbaceous oak. More savory and herbaceous flavors on the finish: cacao mint and polished oak."
1052,8,"A classic bourbon nose as butterscotch hard candies meet oak creamed honey beeswax candle licorice and wood char. At full proof this really blows the doors off and a splash of water cracks open the peanut brittle flavors buttery biscuit root beer spices and oak. The finish rides on for minutes a mouthful of Peanut Chews dark berries and smoky plum with scorched campfire marshmallow."
1053,8,"An opulent nose of dense chewy caramel butterscotch pudding and maple syrup gains depth from nutty earthy and tobacco leaf notes. The maturity appears in appealing glimpses of varnish and wood polish. The palate too doesn’t disappoint with the rich and creamy sweetness balanced with generous oak tannins lending fine balance. On the finish look for drying cedar and oak with clove and pepper. A blend of four different Indiana high-rye bourbons distilled in 2007 and 2008."
1054,5,"Wonderful opening of cigar humidor and tack room it presents vibrant caramel and vanilla but really shines with complex fruit spice and nuts. Baked apples canned pears blackberries and strawberry jam meet white pepper followed by roasted walnuts and honey. Then resounding nutmeg appears with slight hints of smoke chipotle and earth. The long finish rekindles the caramel note from the beginning. Must-have sipper."
1055,5,"With the quintessential traditional bourbon bouquet it’s caramel and vanilla all day with honey oak brown sugar and freshly baked corn muffins following. Then pure bliss striking powerful mouth-coating notes of crème brûlée fried dough with powdered sugar raspberry tarts and maple syrup. The long finish offers a beautiful pecan pie note. Delightful to sip."
1056,2,"Part of Bardstown Bourbon Co.’s Collaboration Series distilled in Tennessee and aged 9 years then finished 18 months in French oak barrels that previously held The Prisoner wine. The nose offers raspberry grape hard candy bubble gum and dried orange slices. A palate of chocolate fudge coconut cinnamon and baking spice leads to a finish that’s rich and smooth with more chocolate and lively fruit. Balanced and with excellent depth; a unified harmonious whiskey. (10000 bottles)"
1057,12,"Minty dark chocolate maple syrup iced tea dark berries tobacco barn peanuts and leather on the nose. The palate is chock-full of rich fruit—blackberry jam plums in syrup black cherries—and luscious dark chocolate with well-integrated oak leather maple syrup drizzle and overtones of herbs. It’s consistent into the finish with cooked fruit leather mint and other herbal flavors and plenty of chocolate. (2500 bottles)"
1058,8,"Strikingly mature and rich yet also lively and vibrant this whiskey tempts with a host of vanilla treats including Nilla wafers milkshake and butter pecan ice cream. Lurking just beneath are deeper nutty flavors saddle leather crushed blueberry and warm apple butter. The palate shows a lot of gusto and while it certainly doesn’t need water a splash rewards by unleashing the ample oak coupled with heaps of Peanut Chews dried apple and more leather on the beautifully balanced finish."
1059,8,"Sticky Cracker Jack butterscotch pudding candy corn fresh-sawn oak and peanut butter-stuffed pretzels on the nose lead to a palate that explodes with sweet candied nuts grape jam citrus peel clove and white pepper spice.

The palate is chewy and full with flavors tumbling over each other in a rush: orange cinnamon clove licorice horehound oak almonds vanilla cream and a bit of herbaceousness. It finishes dry with bright fruit cedary oak cinnamon and almonds."
1061,8,"The nose entices with confections: milk chocolate and nougat candy bars Whoppers and honey. The flavors unwind vivid and bright with warming candied ginger vanilla-frosted birthday cake a beam of bright citrus and toasted nuts and baking spice uniting with Jack Daniel’s estery house character to suggest warm banana bread. Lots of drying oak seals the finish."
1063,5,"This is a 9 year old from the OBSF recipe. Brings to mind intense cinnamon over fruit sprinkled on pumpkin bread cooked in kettle popcorn with a scone. Then there’s an explosion of caramel: crème brûlée salted German chocolate cake glazed doughnut holes and caramel-drizzled baked peaches. Hints of smoke ginger tobacco and clove. A delightfully long finish carries a hint of cinnamon for a must-have quaff. (Maisano’s Fine Wine and Spirits exclusive)"
1064,11,"An 8 year old wheated bourbon finished 27 months in Frapin cognac casks. A dark opulent nose: cocoa crushed sweet cherry and vanilla custard laced with cinnamon and fired with the alcohol heat. My my…it’s even enjoyable at full proof and delivers the sweet promise on a solid bed of oak and heat. Heaven Hill’s getting good at these finishes. Expensive but impressive. (Kentucky Bourbon Affair bottling; others are similar—Heaven Hill’s Bourbon Heritage Center only)"
1065,9,"This whiskey includes bourbon distilled at Buffalo Trace and Bernheim; its final aging was at Stitzel-Weller. Sweet and rich with a mouth-coating velvety texture. Deeper and more polished than its younger NAS sibling (see below). Caramel cocoa powder lush orchard fruit kiwi Seville orange fig and honeyed vanilla balanced by drying oak. Distinctive in character. Best after a hearty meal."
1066,7,"A single barrel bottling from Warehouse N rick number 1 bottled at the proof that Wild Turkey was designed to be. A deeply-woody spiced nose featuring cinnamon and caramel advertises a power punch whiskey but on the palate there's no punch. Instead it’s lush round and affable with deep caramel and cinnamon co-mingling with peanut. The lush sweet start is well-balanced by cinnamon spice which ramps up and drives a long spicy finish. This is delicious whiskey. (Julio’s Liquors only)"
1067,11,"A very pricy (for Wild Turkey) 17 year old whiskey honoring master distiller Jimmy Russell. Nose is hot for the proof with oak dried barrel drool warm dried corn tobacco barn and teaberry. Entry is not hot; rather a thread of sweet syrup spreads out into thoroughly integrated corn and oak. Finish slides into drier oak. A fascinating journey through bourbon flavors this is both lighter and more complex than expected. I still prefer younger Wild Turkey but…"
1068,9,"Amber gold. Delicately complex teasing aromas with a potpourri of spices floral notes and complex fruit (oranges plum pineapple coconut). Soft and smooth in texture. Impeccably balanced flavors and subtly complex with notes of exotic fruit subtle spices almonds and soft honey tones."
1069,5,"The dance begins in the open barley fields with a gust of wind catching grain’s natural aromatic presence. Then cherry blossoms and roasted pine nuts tango for dominance just before the core notes kick in: caramel chew malt cornbread brown sugar and chocolate followed by hints of molasses cardamom and gingersnaps. As the finish lingers it’s clear that this is sippin’ whiskey."
1070,8,"Lavish oak aromas display sawdust sandalwood baking spices and Christmas cookies but lurking underneath is lots of dark fruit—black cherry soda blueberry muffin and cassis—tinged with root beer barrels and alpine forest. A truly pretty complex and delicious whiskey although the oak feels like it’s just a bit overdressed. Finished in charred wine barrels. (12000 bottles)"
1071,9,"A blend of two different 11 year old bourbons—one being a rye-based bourbon the other being wheat-based. The wheat lends drinkability while the rye contributes a spicy zing. The combination works very nicely with light toffee nutty caramel nougat soft orchard fruit black cherry vanilla and cinnamon. (Note: this is the first of three different batches that will eventually be bottled.)"
1072,12,"Delightfully rich on the nose with grape jelly raspberries Raisinets buttered pecans toffee dark chocolate baking spice leather and the old oak smell of a rickhouse. Chewy and viscous the palate shows excellent consistency balancing raisins Concord grape jelly baking spice and dark chocolate with coffee bean cola and lush oak. A lengthy and elegant finish highlights mocha grape skins cinnamon black pepper and rich oak. Best Value"
1073,12,"This is Bardstown Bourbon’s first release using its own whiskey—60% 2 year old bourbon along with 40% 11 year old from another Kentucky distillery. The nose is herbal with a rush of peppermint along with caramel-swirl ice cream peanuts in the shell and root beer. In the mouth it’s dense with cooked dark fruit cola chocolate nuts and well-integrated spice (nutmeg white pepper allspice). More dark fruit spice dark chocolate espresso and oak on the lush finish."
1074,2,"A complex nose that starts out herbaceous and then opens to notes of saddle leather buttered popcorn pecans dark cherry orange tea and fragrant vanilla. A rich chewy palate offers vanilla cream pie lemon blackberries corn muffin and chocolate-covered coconut balanced against some drying oak an herbal note and dried leaves. The finish is a long balanced ride of chocolate cinnamon and tobacco leaf. A rich classic bourbon."

Full and rich in the mouth with fruit leather blueberry-pomegranate juice orange oil ginger pepper dark chocolate cola molasses and coconut. The finish is lengthy and superb: horehound candy white pepper dark chocolate-covered blueberries and silky yet racy oak."
1076,12,"The nose is spiced—cinnamon allspice clove pepper—and rich with cooked fruit—blueberry jam stewed plums pomegranate molasses—as well as roasted peanuts vanilla and oak. In the mouth there’s more liveliness with Big Red gum cherry pie blackberry cobbler peanuts and cinnamon-apple coffee cake. It wraps up beautifully with chili-chocolate roasted nuts and cigar end. Kentucky Owl doesn’t disclose the ages of the bourbons used in this bottling but the balance of maturity on the nose and verve on the palate work to excellent effect."
1077,8,"Initial fruit aromas play host to a savory medicinal note like cherry cough drops or Robitussin hinting of the formidable flavors to come as this dense whiskey unleashes waves of black cherry soda chewy figs stone fruits citrus zest and a cascade of bright vanilla on the rolling finish."
1078,12,"Sweet confectionary aromas delight the nose with peach cobbler sweet potato pie chocolate wafer cookies peanut shells and toasted oak. It’s bright and lively on the palate with excellent texture and balance; roasted pecans dark chocolate brown sugar and tobacco leaf. Expressive fruit—grapes cherries blueberries and blackberries—comes to the fore with a few drops of water and it finishes full and rich with pepper and baking spices nutty chocolate and drying oak."
1079,13,"Distilled in Indiana from a mashbill of 74% corn 21% rye and 5% malted barley the nose has notes of toasted bread almond butter honey-roasted peanuts and caramel topping. The palate is creamy and sweet with rich oak well-integrated spice and peanuts—densely packed flavors that compose a full and rich body. The finish boasts admirable length with savory nuts and semi-sweet chocolate. This has delightful sweetness throughout; everything is perfectly ordered and arranged. (2700 bottles)"
1080,2,"A lively herbal nose leads to sweeter aromas of chocolate syrup baking spice and toasted almonds. Loads of cherry on the palate—cherry pie cherry muffins and a note of raspberry tart. A long pleasing finish shows chocolate roasted pecans and cooked red fruit. Smooth and balanced with depth and lively fruit integrating with semi-sweet chocolate and oak. Whiskey lovers with a sweet tooth will adore this one but it has plenty of appeal for all. (7500 bottles)"
1081,13,"Distilled in Kentucky from a mashbill of 78% corn 13% rye and 9% malted barley the nose showcases notes of orange peel butterscotch flan and honey-roasted peanuts. The palate is tart and acidic; orange marmalade and lemon peel with loads of nuts and spices. Even with water added dried citrus peel and roasted nuts break through. The finish is mouthwatering with tingling spice and rich oak. Well-balanced and flavorful with density and dimension. (1290 bottles)"
1082,12,"A beautiful mingling of herbal (eucalyptus spearmint) and fruity (cherries grape soda orange blossom) aromas to start with pound cake honey-roasted peanuts root beer and leather. The palate is oak-led but lively showing expressive spice root beer orange cherry peanut mint and eucalyptus flavors. It finishes full dry and peppery with Brazil nuts cocoa powder and grape fruit leather. Bottled by Proof and Wood Ventures makers of Deadwood whiskey and Rob Morton formerly of New York City bar Idle Hands. (219 bottles)"
1083,9,"The first four-grain 100% copper pot-distilled bourbon in many decades. The flavors are distinctive silky-textured and seamless. Bright fruit notes of berries and citrus are balanced nicely by maple syrup caramel and toffee. The whiskey is quite nutty too and delicately spiced with vanilla mint and cinnamon. It finishes pleasingly smooth and polished."
1084,9,"Aged in a Cabernet Franc barrel for 8 years after spending 6 years in new charred oak barrels. Bright amber with maple syrup vanilla candy corn white chocolate cinnamon and ripe berried fruit. Nice tannic grip especially on the finish. Great balance between the sweetness fruit and tannins. This is what finishing is all about: giving more than it takes away (or masks). Nicely done!"
1085,5,"At 6 years old it’s hard to believe this could get any better with more time in the barrel. It begins with an explosion of honey warm graham crackers cinnamon nutmeg and marzipan. Then it’s saddle leather pumice caramel-covered popcorn and jalapeño-and-peach jam spread over a flat tamale. More baking spices develop as the whiskey finishes long with a lovely salted-caramel note."
1086,12,"A straight bourbon that was finished in barrels made with alternating charred and toasted staves. There’s plenty of wood char and pencil shavings on the nose along with dry leaves pine needles tea leaves orange peel clove nutmeg cedar sandalwood menthol and licorice. It’s chewy and naturally quite oak-forward in the mouth with complex flavors of spice dark cherry black tea and herbs—mint licorice sassafras and cinnamon. More spice semi-sweet chocolate tea leaves and well-integrated oak into the finish. (2700 bottles)"
1087,9,"Smooth with gently layered sweet notes; nicely balanced. The least amount of oak and just a peppering of cinnamon and mint influence compared to the other four releases. It’s the most versatile of the four too.Not as complex as the “Rye 125” but it makes up for this with its inviting drinkability and balance. Price is per 375 ml."
1088,9,"Complex and robust with the biggest body of the group here. Very spicy (brisk clove evergreen warming cinnamon) but a solid sweet underbelly of toffee caramel and vanilla balances it. Its dry spicy finish makes a bold statement without crossing the line. Very nice! Price is per 375 ml."
1089,12,"Chocolate-covered cherries grape hard candy iced tea peppermint stick and white pepper on the nose; with time brown sugar and toffee emerge. The palate is chewy without water velvety and replete with dark mature flavors: concord grape jelly Cherry Coke dark chocolate roasted nuts white pepper and varnish. Seamless from start to rewarding finish. (51000 bottles)"
1090,2,"Made in the sour mash style by adding in some of the backset—the liquid that’s strained from the spent mash after distillation. This particular backset is from a mash of peated malted barley and the result is an earthy whiskey with spiced accents that meld with sweeter flavors of candied grapes and dark fruits. The finish is long smooth and rich with back notes of spice and cracked pepper. (2250 bottles)"
1091,12,"Swirling aromas in the glass make it hard to pick out distinct notes but a few emerge: mint leaves leather bookbinding raisins grape jelly and—after some time and water—caramel and candied peanuts. Light and silky in the mouth a few drops of water make the flavors pop: cherry pie filling berry and grape jams chocolate polished oak and maple syrup. The finish has dark fruit dark chocolate and lengthy mint and tea leaf. (18000 bottles)"
1092,12,"Dripping with dark fruit aromas of blackberry blueberry raspberry and black grapes. There’s also dark chocolate leather old barn boards and cedar chest; everything hints at maturity and richness on the palate which is jammy with dark fruit and shot through with bittersweet chocolate coffee bean polished oak and well-integrated spice. It finishes with more of the same. Give this a few minutes in the glass before sipping and it will open beautifully. (6000 bottles)"
1093,5,"If Picasso sketched bourbon it would look like Booker’s with deep golden and auburn hues. But higher-proof color can deceive. Not here. Think bourbon warehouse: oak caramel tobacco leaf cinnamon vanilla; floral with hints of honey and blueberry. And then it really comes alive. Oh baby! Candy corn crème brûlée maple syrup nutmeg and traces of chipotle and cayenne. The proof strength doesn’t show. I recommend this batch neat for full unrelenting flavor."
1094,9,"A wheated recipe bourbon that was aged in experimental barrels with staves utilizing various methods of seasoning. Oak spice is important with a wheated bourbon as there is no rye to balance the sweet notes and this whiskey does a great job here. Delicate in personality with nutty caramel dried citrus and golden raisin segueing to polished leather warming cinnamon clove and hints of a cigar humidor."
1095,5,"Released in the spring of 2016. True balance and consistency from nose to finish showing toffee saltwater taffy cinnamon Jolly Rancher crème brûlée nutmeg toasted pecan chocolate fruit delicate spice. Hints of pear peach and apple. I love the coffee and hazelnut on the long finish. I wonder if the taste would improve in the 107 to 111 proof range. As it is now this is a must-have sipper."
1096,5,"Think the holidays: nutmeg butterscotch cinnamon gingerbread cookies and saltwater taffy. Mouth-coating sensations down the jawline and palate roof. Caramel and vanilla follow it home to the finish where out-of-nowhere black currant and blackberry jam linger to the very end. This is a fun sipper for those who love the barrel-finished style. (375 ml.)"
1097,5,"This straight bourbon is a race of notes trying to outrun each other. Out of the gate it’s caramel and vanilla with a bevy of fruit soft florals and chocolate slightly trailing. Oak and smoke take the lead on the first turn then an explosion of butterscotch and Spanish flan setting the pace. Then graham crackers marshmallow and melted chocolate eye the prize with rich rounded caramel custard taking the long route to the finish line. Definite contender!"
1098,5,"The perfect proof. Rich in color aroma and flavor. It begins with powerful caramel baking spice chocolate cherries cinnamon and toffee. Then nuance and complexity. Honey jalapeño rosemary crème brûlée malt and fruit from the spicy citrus of grapefruit to prunes and dried apricots. Hard to believe this is over 100 proof as you never sense the strength challenging you to find what’s next amidst the subtlety. Extremely long finish with cherry cinnamon and caramel. Value Pick."
1099,11,"Old school spicy nose almost archetypal scents of sweet teaberry cinnamon and spearmint hard candy with a firm warm alcohol backing. True in the mouth: I’m tasting just what I smelled all on a full bed of corn sweetness floating off into a warm finish. Could it be more complex? Yes but it’s beautifully balanced and not the over-oaked shellac that passes for mature bourbon these days. If this was under $30 a bottle I’d marry it. (6000 bottles)"
1100,9,"The fifth release in Diageo’s Orphan Barrel series (and the youngest of the releases so far). Distilled at the “new” Bernheim distillery and once again matured most recently in Stitzel-Weller warehouses. Complex flavors are well-integrated with lovely spice notes (cinnamon vanilla mint nutmeg) nougat caramel and subtle fruit. Long satisfying finish. Not as distinctive as some previous Orphan Barrel releases but more rounded and balanced. Nicely done!"
1101,9,"Big and spicy but contrasted by layers of sweetness. Vibrant dried spice (warming cinnamon crisp mint nutmeg and cigar box) caramel nougat black raspberry dried citrus and a hint of chocolate fudge laced with coconut. Very warming on the finish with a nice resinous grip without being over-oaked. A very dynamic whiskey."
1102,12,"Orange zest cocoa powder toasted marshmallow spiced root beer peanuts in the shell and pure vanilla bean on the nose along with the pleasant aroma of standing inside a dusty old barn. The body has heft and purpose weaving together orange marmalade corn cakes root beer horehound candy gingerbread spices and blueberry jam with well-integrated oak throughout. Unlike other contenders this hits the perfect proof. (Costco)"
1103,12,"Nashville restaurant Peg Leg Porker’s pitmaster Carey Bringle filters this whiskey through hickory charcoal. Malted milk balls peanuts in the shell toasted grain Swiss Miss hot cocoa mix licorice root beer and tea leaves to start with lots of oak dark chocolate blackberry white pepper cinnamon cherry cough syrup and more root beer on the sweet spiced palate. The finish is delicate and fruited with sweet cherries and blackberries as well as a sprinkling of cloves and subtle oak."
1104,12,"A combination of 6 8 10 and 12 year old bourbons distilled at Wild Turkey. It has that glorious peanut-rich Turkey nose along with orange soda Golden Delicious apples cooked blackberries and blueberries pomegranate syrup white pepper cinnamon ginger and iced tea. Beautifully balanced on the palate with plenty of spice roasted peanuts cherry cough syrup blackberry jam cola dill and dark chocolate. It ends lusciously with warming spices chocolate and oak."
1105,8,"Earthy leathery and spiced this bourbon shows nice maturity and polish evoking a well-worn wood-paneled barroom. The flavors offer good intensity and concentration striking a nice balance of sweet and savory notes as spicy cedarwood and cigar box come draped in toffee. Water releases some vivid chocolate vanilla cream and clove-studded orange. Nice verve fine balance and evident maturity."
1106,8,"Lovely concentration of flavors including whiffs of vanilla cream soda clover honey bananas Foster and a dash of pepper define this selection of barrels by Old Forester president Campbell Brown. Zippy and bright with lemony verve peach puree and warming ginger. The finish smacks of pecan bitter citrus oil and peppery spice with the exquisite oak content in a supporting role. (Available at Old Forester Distillery)"
1107,9,"A delicious base of creamy vanilla and rich caramel complemented by tropical fruit (coconut pineapple ripe mango) golden raisin and raspberry preserve and jazzed up with spice (cocoa cinnamon nutmeg). Polished oak on the finish. The flavors are nicely integrated. My favorite of the last several annual releases."
1108,11,"Rich and sweet on the nose: crème brûlée unfinished oak furniture circus peanuts overripe warm melon. Corn puffs and sweet cornbread vanilla cream oak density firm heat and an affably full mouthfeel that doesn’t thin till the very end. Easily one of the best Jack Daniel’s whiskeys I’ve ever had but the price is jaw-dropping even today (the package does include a previously-unreleased 1966 concert recording of Old Blue Eyes). Price is per 1 liter."
1109,9,"Darker in both flavor and personality when compared to its sibling. Rich palate-coating caramel and toffee provide the foundation for roasted nuts dark berry fruit cocoa powder cinnamon and polished leather. Long satisfying finish. Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection French Oak Barrel Aged Bourbons 2015 Release. Price is per 375 ml."
1110,8,"A lovely nose of overripe pears and baked apple is drizzled with caramel and toffee sweetness then veers into bakeshop notes of sticky-bun pastry. The rich mouth-coating palate piles on more sweet fruit and tarte Tatin with flavors of mocha peanut chocolate bars and lemongrass lending complexity. Drying tannins toasted almond and sandalwood bring home the finish. Best Value"
1111,9,"Distilled in 2002. For many years now this wheated whiskey has maintained just the right amount of oak influence for balance and added complexity. This year’s release is sporting some extra dried oak spice (especially on the finish) but it’s still a delicious whiskey. Notes of toffee maple syrup blackberry jam cinnamon and vanilla with a dry allspice and polished leather finish."
1112,9,"Often ignored because it’s not barrel proof like the other bourbons in the collection. The past couple years have shown a gradual increase in oak spice and resin. This year’s offering particularly sports unnecessary oak showing more leather dried spice (especially cinnamon) barrel char and tannins than needed to marry with the toffee caramel rum mocha dried fruit and tobacco notes. Still very enjoyable but slightly past its prime."
1113,13,"Sweet and nutty on the nose: brown sugar wet walnuts Cherry Coke pralines and roasted peanuts. Water releases vanilla-blueberry muffins orange peel and cherry Pixy Stix. These notes continue onto the oily palate with blueberry and raspberry jams cooked plums maple syrup and a touch of leather. The lengthy finish offers more of the same plus black pepper and polished oak. Water brings better balance and sweeter notes of tiramisu and Christmas cake."
1114,9,"Heaven Hill’s first wood-finished bourbon. Finished for several months in cognac casks (reminiscent of Beam’s Distillers’ Masterpiece offering around a decade ago) which show nicely without dominating. Very silky and smooth in texture. Notes of graham cracker dark fleshy fruit (ripe grape blackberry brandy) light toffee maple syrup on pancakes and creamy vanilla. Great balance distinctive and perilously drinkable for 100 proof."
1115,13,"Comprised of 2 to 4 year old bourbons; it seems more mature. Werther’s Original pecan pie corn muffin and iced tea highlight the nose. The palate is well-textured spiced and sweet with more tea and herbal notes like licorice and spearmint. The finish maintains that character with minty oak baking spice and bitter tea leaves. This shows consistency and direction from front to back with plenty of proof to boot."
1116,13,"A blend of straight bourbons finished in maple syrup barrels. The nose is rich with brown sugar honey orange peel and rose oil; elegant and polished. The palate suggests hot chocolate raspberry jam and bitter cherries a syrupy sweetness shining through. The finish shows good length and continued sweetness with brown sugar glaze cocoa powder and coffee cake. A dessert lover’s dream the finishing cask sweetness is the star here."
1117,2,"Woodford Reserve’s oldest-ever release includes barrels from 2003. Licorice sassafras dried herbs and slate on the nose followed by a palate that’s rich and spiced with notes of nutty chocolate grape jelly Christmas cake brown sugar and aged oak. Water unlocks lively notes of raspberry tart and nutmeg and a lengthy finish offers cocoa powder espresso and semi-sweet chocolate. Mature well-spiced herbal and balanced with dessert-like chocolate and espresso flavors."
1118,2,"The Double Barrel name denotes the fact that each batch is a blend from only two barrels. Fragrant notes of warm cinnamon bread raisins banana and clove on the nose along with toasty oak and old leather. A new burst of flavors on the palate reveals cocoa powder spice cake coconut creamy chocolate cinnamon and chili pepper. A long finish of rich chocolate almond and a delicate hint of blackberry."
1119,8,"A platform of caramel sweetness comes draped in lovely oak spice with dried flower potpourri—like rose petals and an old-lady’s perfume—along with horehound cedary oak and iced tea. The palate veers toward dried fruits—apple rings and dates—with bitter orange peel and a beam of spice that turns peppery on the long finish of tobacco and cedar. The overall impression is lithe upright and stately."
1120,8,"This begins with a big scoop of banana pudding or maybe it’s banana cream pie since there is a lively dusting of cinnamon and nutmeg. Pretty floral notes sweet Jordan almonds and apple candies are well integrated with oak. What it lacks in deep complexity it makes up for with vibrancy joie de vivre and sheer drinking pleasure that revels in a satisfyingly long finish."
1121,2,"Aged at least 18 months in new charred oak then finished with Texas pecan wood staves added to the barrel. The nose offers melted caramel buttered pecan vanillin oak and subtle fruit. A soft palate has notes of baked plum tart chocolate figs allspice tea leaf and dusty oak. The finish is spiced with dark chocolate light tobacco and hefty but well-integrated oak. Bold and robust with an abundance of flavors. (42000 bottles)"
1122,12,"The nose is thick with peanut brittle and peanut shells blackberry cobbler grape jelly allspice dried ginger and mint and other herbs. Beautifully mature flavors on the palate: cooked plums raisins and dark chocolate mingle with integrated oak with peanuts bringing up the rear. Silky especially in the finish which fades almost too quickly to relish dark chocolate-covered cherries peanuts and smooth oak. (2000 bottles)"
1123,2,"Carnival notes of candied apple cotton candy cherry cola and a hint of orange peel on the nose along with licorice burnt brown sugar and melted caramel. A deep rich palate offers notes of dried fruit toasty wood dark chocolate cinnamon spice and light herbaceousness. Wood char spice bitter chocolate and white pepper complete the finish. Thick chewy and remarkably complex for a relatively youthful bourbon. Water or ice recommended. (42 bottles)"
1124,8,"The nose feels dense and richly layered as cedary oak and sandalwood incense take the lead while a deeper dive reveals toasted walnuts licorice and cocoa. The palate serves up plenty of sweet butterscotch juicy grapefruit and shaved coconut before drying oak tannins sweep in delivering coffee and dark chocolate cake on the finish. A supple mouthfeel and long finish enhance the overall delicious impression made by this bourbon. Shows best at full proof. Best Value"
1125,2,"From New York-based PM Spirits this barrel proof high-rye (36%) bourbon was distilled at MGP in 2015 and bottled at Strong Spirits in Bardstown Ky. in July 2019. The nose has notes of dried orange apple strudel banana custard and a hint of cinnamon. The palate is gentle candied and perfumed offering flavors of tiramisu and orange marmalade. Finishes with a flourish of quince crème brûlée nougat and pepper spice. (8196 bottles)"
1126,5,"There’s a certain complexity here that you just come to expect in limited edition Four Roses. This one doesn’t disappoint. Rose petals honeysuckle caramel roasted pine nuts cotton candy dark coffee and vanilla. The creamy mouthfeel delightfully brings in warm cinnamon roll chocolate truffle and honey taffy balanced by herbs and subtle earthiness that settle with a long-lasting cinnamon-forward finish."
1127,5,"Delightful opening of fruit praline caramel maraschino cherries and spice with a burst of smoked paprika and a hint of leather. It’s soft on the palate easily gliding down the jawline filling with flavors of caramel chew saltwater taffy coffee and a rich toasted pumpernickel rye with just a sprinkle of cinnamon. Based on the taste I’d think this flavorful beauty would offer a long finish but misses the mark. Thankfully spice over the medium finish is quite pleasant."
1128,9,"A limited run to commemorate Elmer’s birthday. An elegant complex whiskey. The flavors are nice and tight. Bright fruit (dried citrus tangerine nectarine hint of pineapple) brittle mint vanilla and gin botanicals soothed by nougat and soft caramel with subtle -- yet lingering -- dark chocolate espresso and dried tobacco on the finish. Great drinkability too!"
1129,5,"Rich and rounded vanilla baking spices caramel and cast iron-baked cornbread straight from the oven. Hints of smoke dried apricot fresh-cut grass and tilled earth. Then raw honey marzipan raisins and sweet oats followed by baking spices for a medium to long finish. It’s very nice and needs no dilution to open up. Think of this as a high-proof sipper."
1130,5,"Gorgeous dried apricot peach cobbler vanilla custard plus a hint of cherry-flavored pipe tobacco. Rich layered and rounded caramel with hints of cinnamon nutmeg clove and allspice. Then earth and lots of it over a slightly chewy mouthfeel of caramel chew and Red Hots cinnamon candy. Medium finish counters wonderful bouquet and palate notes but still lovely for sipping."
1131,2,"Cooked cherries cherry cough drops raspberry vanilla dried banana chips and old attic on the nose. The palate’s texture is smooth with undertones of spice and rich overtones of chocolate blackberry jam toasted almonds zabaione cinnamon and pepper against mature but balanced oak. A spiced finish offers blackberry vanilla cinnamon and tobacco. Richly herbal with deep fruit and chocolate and balanced maturity. (Collectible)"
1132,9,"Light bronze color. Thick mature aromas with notes of subtle spice (vanilla mint) toffee light molasses and leather. Adding a little water revealing notes of teaberry anise and dark candied fruit. Pleasantly sweet at first in flavor with notes of brown sugar and spice (vanilla mint) becoming dry with enveloping flavors of oak and leather. With a little water more subtle flavors are revealed including toffee dark fruit and anise. The whisky finishes long and dry with significant depth. This is a big exciting bourbon full of character from the distillery previously known as Ancient Age. The price is right too-if you can find the whiskey to buy it."
1133,5,"Tennessee whiskey shall not be undersold in this flavorful version. Rich notes of caramel and vanilla developing in yellow cake batter with dark caramel brown sugar leather toasted pecans and hints of walnut smoked apple and honey. Then red fruit baking spice and complex butterscotch over a palate-coating mouthfeel that’s perfectly warm and balanced all over. As good as it is it could be better with ten more proof points. Its light proof shows in a shorter-than-desired finish. (Tennessee only) 375ml"
1134,2,"An herbal lightly malty nose starts with notes of sweet barrel char cherry hard candy raspberry pastilles and a hint of green banana. The palate is rich with flavors of chocolate and burnt espresso beans bitter orange pepper spice and burnt almonds. The lengthy finish has notes of candied raspberries riding atop some deeper notes of allspice and pepper. Balanced and fruity overtones throughout anchored by earthiness and spice underneath. (24000 bottles)"
1135,9,"A remarkably balanced bourbon. Evolving notes of maple vanilla mint dried fruit coconut and polished oak with a hint of leather on the finish. Very clean and drinkable too-especially for a 13 year old bourbon. Only 726 bottles were produced but it’s worth tracking down one of the remaining bottles."
1136,9,"One of the leading bourbon-specialty bars in the U.S. located in Chicago finally has its own single barrel bourbon. The flavors are nicely balanced and there’s a soothing creamy texture throughout the palate. Sweet notes of coconut cream vanilla fudge and honeycomb are enhanced by a complex array of more delicate notes of spearmint green tea golden raisin dusty corn cocoa and oak resin. This time “13” is a lucky number."
1137,9,"Stagg is so smooth it’s quite drinkable at higher proofs. On the other hand when you bring it down to the strength that you would normally drink your whiskey it’s almost too easygoing (I made the same comment about last year’s William Larue Weller bottling). The main theme to this whiskey is lush toffee sweetness and like last year’s expression some vanilla fudge nougat and molasses. Underlying notes of dates tobacco dark berried fruit spearmint and a hit of coffee round out the palate. Given the higher strength it’s a true value bourbon -- almost like getting two bottles in one. A very nice whiskey but when brought down to comparable strength the Eagle Rare 17 has more complexity."
1138,11,"Knob was one of the first bourbons I had when I started taking whiskey seriously and it’s still a kicker. No-nonsense flint-hard nose: slickly-polished oak furniture cinnamon stick cracked rye wet cornmeal hard candies. Bang! A lean whiskey that gets in your mouth and explodes with rye spice and cinnamon candy a sharp wedge that opens you right up. The finish echoes: oak a dying fire clean and almost crisp. Emphatic bright and swift. Value Pick"
1139,5,"The Angel’s Envy Cask Strength port cask finished bourbon has developed a cult following and it’s easy to see why. Jumping out are marshmallow caramel vanilla roasted nuts with a hint of cardamom coffee and nutmeg but true beauty lies in the pronounced pumpkin pie dark chocolate raw pine nut caramel and sweet maltiness. I’d love for this whiskey to finish longer but it does give a hint of nutmeg toward the end. Sourced whiskey."
1140,5,"From Kentucky the journey begins with generous at-the-fair candy corn and subtle hints of vanilla caramel and smoke. I find the caramelized grains and spice just as appealing. While the hint of maple syrup is nice this is simple goodness with every taste. Sourced whiskey."
1141,9,"Each of these three bourbons was distilled and bottled at the same time and aged in the same warehouse for 12 years and 3 months. The main variable was the floor they were aged on. In theory the higher up in the warehouse the greater the temperature variation and the more wood influence. Does the experiment support this general concept? Yes with the sweet spot being the middle floor.

Similar sweet notes as its sibling aged in floor #1 (caramel honey ripe fruit) but with an additional layer of dried spice (cinnamon vanilla clove) to accompany it. It has all the components of a fine bourbon and it’s also nicely balanced with good oak grip on the finish. The best of the three. Price is per 375 ml"
1142,9,"Distilled at Buffalo Trace in Kentucky but aged mostly in Virginia at the A. Smith Bowman distillery. This is a bold hearty bourbon: not elegant or refined rather a bit mean and moody at times. Sweeter gentler notes of vanilla caramel nougat mocha and candied fruit wrestle with more aggressive tobacco leather and damp forest floor notes. Warming cinnamon-tinged gripping finish. A rewarding whiskey for those with an adventurous soul."
1143,9,"A bright and lively bourbon. Nicely balanced too with notes of caramel custard red licorice orange marmalade golden raisin and coconut cream underpinned by crisp rye and tantalizing cinnamon. A gently sweetish whiskey -- not cloying in any way. In fact it’s very drinkable. And it’s a whiskey that demonstrates great harmony between youth and maturity."
1144,5,"Initially it’s a nut-filled experience with toasted walnuts pecans and Brazil nuts but an atypical spice appears that’s just lovely. Smoked hatch chiles mingle with rounded notes of cinnamon créme brûlée Bananas Foster orange canned peaches caramel chew and toffee. The pepper spices reappear for a grand finish."
1145,5,"It opens with a crust of salt and Flintstones vitamins in honey almond paste and caramel. Then pumice pear canned peaches and baked apples jump into the mix followed by Nutella Cheerios candied pecans and chocolate. As the medium to long finish sets in slight hints of smoke appear and suggest it would pair great with a bold cigar. A drop of water only makes it better."
1146,8,"A bold nose smacks of sweetness and deep layers of leathery oak and toasted nuts. The palate pours sweet initially with earthy dried apples citrus and bread crust before the bitter citrus pith and tobacco notes rush in turning dry and tannic with tea leaves dried herbs and cigar wrapper. Finals wisps of varnish are a hallmark of age. This elder statesman deserves respect but is nonetheless past its prime."
1148,8,"This is sure to be a divisive edition but once you open your mind to the idea it’s hard to argue with the titillating aromas and seductive sweetness that curaçao casks bring. Resembling a bourbon liqueur the nose is replete with tangerine orange peel tropical fruit and nougat. The palate circles back to classic bourbon notes that manage to find balance with the candied orange nose."
1149,9,"Very floral and fragrant. Gently sweet too: apple tart laced with cinnamon pancakes drizzled with maple syrup.  Well-defined oak and crisp dry spice (cinnamon anise cocoa nutmeg) balance the sweetness. An interesting whiskey: big in some ways yet elegant in others"
1150,9,"Buffalo Trace distilled a wheated bourbon and aged barrels from the same distillation date on three different floors (1 5 and 9) for 12 ½ years to see what the differences would be. This is similar to an experiment they conducted last year using a rye mashbill bourbon. As you will see the higher the floor the more intense the flavors and the greater the wood influence.

Gentle and easygoing. Creamy texture with layered sweet notes of caramel vanilla marzipan and crème brûlée. Soft background spice lingers on a delicate soothing finish. Price is per 375 ml."
1151,9,"Richly flavored and surprisingly sweet on the nose and front of the palate. A tactile whiskey: creamy yet becoming resinous toward the finish. Notes of vanilla saltwater taffy roasted nuts tobacco and molasses. An intriguing whiskey and my favorite of the three."
1152,9,"An elegant bourbon and very drinkable too! Its flavors are clean and tight with bright fruit (nectarine tangerine
pineapple) soft coconut honeyed vanilla cotton candy and subtle gin botanicals. Polished leather and a hint of dark chocolate on the finish. Great anytime. (Exclusive to Capital City Package.)"
1153,5,"Initially it’s extremely perfume-like with floral notes often found in fragrances. Then the fruit completely takes over: banana blueberry plums cherry apple pear and quince. Of these the banana lingers until chocolate and vanilla enter the picture followed by hints of green pepper and graham cracker. Then boom baking spices launch into a lovely medium to long finish."
1154,9,"Aged slightly more than 9 years. (The annual single barrel releases jumped last year from approximately 10 years old to 9 years old with both a 2005 and 2006 vintage released in the same year.) A mélange of fruit (apricot candied citrus pineapple golden raisin) spiked with fresh mint and cinnamon on a bed of caramel and vanilla. In true form this bourbon is flavorful and well-rounded."
1155,8,"A profusion of nutty aromas: freshly shelled peanuts boiled peanuts and buttered pecan lead the way with candied cherries and molasses on toast emerging on the palate. There are also heaps of dusty drying oak throughout helping to balance the oily texture. Finishes with chocolate-covered cherries blueberry pie more peanut and drying wood tannins."
1156,2,"The nose is earthy chalky and herbal with notes of caramel and baking spice. The palate shows its proof well with lots of balanced oak and bitter herbs plus cherry and orange. The finish has flavors of bitter chocolate coffee ice cream burnt almond dried orange slices and a deft influence of toasted oak. This is a big robust whiskey with impressive complexity and plenty to like. (303 bottles)"
1157,2,"The nose has notes of cherry candy pink pastilles and a bowl of raspberries and blueberries as well as brown sugar cinnamon caramel and toffee. The palate begins with overtones of toasted nuttiness fruit notes of sweet peach apricot and cherry all underpinned by vanilla caramel brown sugar and white pepper. The finish melds pepper spice chocolate roasted pecans and blackberry. Light on its feet balancing against the oak."
1158,2,"An herbal nose of thyme dill and licorice underpinning notes of blueberry jam cherries chocolate honey-roasted nuts and old leather. The palate is full and creamy with milk chocolate cinnamon blackberry toasted almond dried herbs and oak. Water brings out more chocolate and spicy heat. A long finish of oak almond chocolate and cracked pepper with a tobacco overlay. A big robust bourbon with plenty to like."
1159,2,"Floral on the nose with notes of orange blossom as well as cinnamon caramel coffee cake and cola. The palate is smooth and balanced featuring pound cake chocolate frosting pepper Almond Joy and lemon iced tea. The finish has excellent length and reprises the tropical notes. Water brings out vanilla custard and cinnamon. Light complex and balanced with great integration of flavors; perfect for the warmer months."
1160,2,"The nose is fragrant with aromas of spice cabinet charred oak burnt nuts clove dark chocolate and black pepper. The palate is big spicy and chewy with bitter charred oak dark chocolate coffee beans toasted almonds cracked pepper and bitter lemon. Water reveals roasted peanut shells campfire and more chocolate. The finish is long and flavorful with back notes of spiced oak espresso and sweet chocolate. Rich mouth-filling and satisfying."
1161,9,"Nicely rounded and very drinkable. Warming cinnamon vanilla bean and dried fruit wrapped up in creamy caramel and light toffee. Pleasant gently sweet finish. Great anytime. 375ml"
1162,13,"Complex and layered on the nose; what starts off as herbaceous with pine cone tea leaf lemon oil and toasted nuts develops into sweet aromas of candied nuts cinnamon challah bread maple syrup and toffee. A full-bodied and chewy palate is heavily spiced with cinnamon pepper caraway and roasted elements once water is added. A mouthwatering finish shows good length herbaceous oak licorice and coffee bean. Time and water both help this whiskey’s full plumage to emerge."
1163,12,"Bakery shop aromas of shortbread vanilla cupcake sugared almond melted marshmallow and banana bread batter form a base for fragrant herbs spice and orange. The palate expands on the herbal character with cedar boughs incense and chamomile alongside orange peel orange blossom water black cherries allspice and lively pepper. Sweetened herbal tea black pepper dried ginger cinnamon cooked cherry and toasted oak to finish."
1164,13,"Starlight’s straight bourbon gets an 8-month finish in new vanilla toast American white oak barrels from Napa Valley cooperage Seguin Moreau. That oak influence shows itself on the nose as pecans rich caramel and antique bookcase. A youthfulness emerges with water. The palate is chewy with generous oak root beer and a dark earthiness. Cocoa powder mint and tea leaf highlight the finish. The structure is clean and the flavors work with or without water."
1165,2,"A pleasant pretty nose with sweetened notes of almond vanilla milkshake milk chocolate candy corn caramel and grape hard candy. Smooth and delicate on a palate that is draped in flavors with notes of spiced chocolate candied orange slices and toffee. Water brings out a fresh array of sweet flavors—vanilla cream birthday cake raspberry tart creamy chocolate and a light influence of tobacco leaf. The finish continues the theme offering length and delicate flavor."
1166,2,"Distilled from 95% New York-grown corn and 5% malted barley. Vanilla ice cream milk chocolate orange zest ginger snaps fresh flowers leather and allspice on the nose. The mouthfeel is light with notes of herbs orange slices vanilla cinnamon chocolate almonds and brown sugar. A smooth spicy finish brings on a finale of orange tart ginger dried almonds and a pleasant cereal note. Light but well spiced with depth and balance. Best Value"
1167,9,"This whiskey’s mashbill includes both rye and wheat. (Most bourbons contain one or the other and usually it’s rye.) The sweet inviting mellowness of the wheat is there; so is the spicy zing of the rye. Look for creamy caramel and soft vanilla peppered with fresh mint and warming cinnamon. Firm oak grip on the finish with lingering spice. Dynamic and invigorating."
1168,0,"On the nose cherry tart baked over a fireplace: rich red fruit with a whiff of soot and some chalky minerality. A lot of warmth on the palate with biscotti almond toffee and warm caramel apple topped with sweet vanilla cream and chocolate ganache on the side. Good creamy texture with some sharp peppery tinges. A 9 year old Tennessee bourbon selected by and bottled for Doc’s Wine Spirits and More in Memphis Tennessee. (152 bottles)"
1169,5,"When the caramel train comes it rarely returns after such strong earthy notes of roots hay and soil. It’s the same story in the next round: first pan-fried sweet potatoes and parsnips dominate; caramel returns with vanilla allspice and white pepper. Then the odd but welcomed combo of campfire-smoked marshmallows and gingersnaps just before a long caramel finish. Very unique."
1170,9,"An exciting blend of straight rye whiskeys finished in French oak and port barrels. Beautifully spiced (warming cinnamon crisp mint) tamed by caramel and vanilla fudge. Red and black raspberry plum dried citrus and wood shavings add complexity. Warming finish. Nicely balanced and very distinctive. (Distillery only until October 1st then nationally)"
1171,8,"Buffalo Trace asked fans to “Craft Your Perfect Bourbon” and this is the result. Cracker Jack and butterscotch sweetness appear on the nose with cedary oak and black cherry soda lurking just beneath. On the palate the flavors are bold mouthwatering and juicy like dark berry fruit sprinkled with baking spices and spearmint. This has big impact but is also delightfully drinkable as the finish delivers citrus oil stone fruit and blackberry."
1172,2,"The nose is fragrant and well-integrated with the oak offering candied orange slices peach and notes of dried red berries. The palate is smooth and has flavors of bright fruit drying oak tannins raspberry jam and semi-sweet chocolate. The finish is lengthy with more fruit notes as well as brown sugar chocolate and pepper spice. The oak flirts with being overdone but creates a balanced and solid expression of well-aged bourbon. (3000 bottles)"
1173,11,"If you wondered when you saw “50%” this is indeed bottled in bond whiskey with all the requirements that go with it. The nose is just this side of hot and brings parched corn sawn maple wood spicy hard candy and dry spearmint leaf. Bright and spicy on the tongue; more candy and honey and hints of teaberry and licorice that develop into the finish. A better package of flavor and price than the earlier Taylor releases; quite enjoyable."
1174,9,"Surprisingly lacking in oak intensity given its age. Very creamy and soothingly sweet with notes of honeyed vanilla crème brûlée sultana orange creamsicle peach cobbler and a subtle array of tropical fruit. Soft and mellow on the finish. It’s very easy-drinking and should be enjoyable under most moods and circumstances."
1175,9,"The third Taylor release and the gentlest most even-keeled of the three. Black raspberry mulberry maple syrup oak resin dates soft leather and spice (mint cinnamon clove vanilla) round out the palate. Very drinkable for 100 proof and with plenty of character."
1176,8,"A kind of luscious sweetness appears up front as pecan pie glazed banana chips dried pineapple dates and green apple candies meet gentle spice. The maturity is really lovely with sweet waxy notes of honeycomb and a palate that smacks of chewy nougat milk chocolate and toasted nuts ending with cinnamon and peppercorn spice; the oak is perfectly restrained. (4000 bottles)"
1177,12,"Sweet toasted grain almonds frozen banana on a Popsicle stick vanilla and green tea on the nose. Without water the palate is overwhelmed by its proof; add a generous amount and you’ll find vanilla almonds toasted grain sweet oak green banana and the freshness of mint leaves. The finish is sweet and velvety with more almonds toasted grain and oak. Atypical profile for Booker’s but plenty to like."
1178,2,"The nose is lightly tropical with notes of oak pine herbs and orange peel. A buttery mouthfeel and a palate that offers almond butterscotch chocolate fudge caramel and oak tannins along with spice and black pepper. The finish has notes of salted peanuts as well as peanut butter which sweeten to flavors of rich chocolate with a hint of marshmallow. Full-bodied sometimes jagged but with a spicy nutty finish"
1179,12,"While the nose showcases primarily grain aromas including cracked corn and peanut shell it also has notes of white pepper dark cherries brown sugar and Hershey’s chocolate syrup—a harbinger of things to come. The palate is a chocolate lover’s dream rich and tantalizing without heaviness. There’s also mint cinnamon cashew butter and well-integrated oak; time and water bring out sweet orange. It finishes with milk chocolate toasted nuts and lingering cinnamon."
1180,5,"One of the few remaining age-stated bourbons. Henry McKenna’s color is beautiful. You can hold it up in sunset light and just enjoy the russet and amber hues reflecting. Sweetness savory and floral fragrances followed by brown sugar fresh-baked rye bread and malt. Caramel and vanilla with roasted pine nuts and spice and a slight hint of strawberry lead to a long and savory finish. Balance is the point of this sipper."
1181,5,"Think carnival aromas—the good ones anyway—meeting the campfire. Cracker Jacks cinnamon-covered almonds popcorn cotton candy marshmallows melting over graham crackers and hints of smoldering oak. Next coconut caramel and cocoa over a buttery mouthfeel with hints of toffee banana baked apple and pumpkin pie appear. Toward the end hints of black pepper and raspberry strudel surface in a medium to long finish."
1182,5,"Think of an Almond Joy candy bar: coconut almond and milk chocolate followed by the candy bar’s rival flavors: caramel vanilla and butterscotch. Then oak leather cigar box marmalade grape jelly a plethora of baking spices and toffee. This beautiful study of barrel strength bourbon needs no water. Caramel in all forms from candied to syrup follows this home for a long and delightful finish."
1200,2,"A blend of straight bourbons at least 15 years old. A fragrant complex nose of oak baking spice cherry pie cooked pears and bitter lemon with underlying notes of cigar box and dunnage house floor. The palate is creamy and sweet offering caramel chocolate frosting coconut shavings a fruity note of sweet raspberry and chili pepper. A finish of tobacco leaf dark chocolate and more spiciness as a final note."
1183,5,"This is a re-release of the 2015 bottling. A tapestry of confectionery delights begins this journey followed by fruit cigar box saddle leather cotton candy roasted pecans caramel and marshmallow. Then it’s smoked paprika fig cinnamon strawberry and dark cherries. In the form of walnut shells a powerful and somewhat pleasant bitterness finds the finish with a hint of chocolate. But that bitterness does supersede the more pleasant notes making it slightly unbalanced."
1184,5,"Complexity right off. Cherry candied nuance smoke caramel French toast vanilla and apricot but then an explosion of marzipan coats the palate with vanilla freshly baked rye bread and hints of brown sugar nutmeg toasted almond and bittersweet chocolate. Finally cherry cola and herbs walk you to a lovely long bitter finish with warm undertones. This is a year-round front porch sipper."
1185,11,"“Contains five times more rye than A. Smith Bowman’s standard bourbon recipe” aged 7 years and 9 months. A lean bourbon nose: sweet grain leather pepper oak. Zing in the mouth! Quite spicy with a smooth oily feel notes of dried apple and split fruit-tree branches and a driving but welcome heat that lines straight through to the long dry finish. Bold interesting and worthy of repeating! Limited release; mainly in Virginia."
1186,11,"Blends 7 and 12 year old bourbons and a 7 year wheater in a beautifully packaged tribute to the old brand. Typical nose—cinnamon Red Hots milled corn oaky zest—in balanced harmony. Beautiful stuff on the tongue: warm but not hot expansive corn sweetness that lightens the cinnamon’s intensity some clove some oaky dryness. The warm finish only ends after a long embrace. Pricey for 7 year old bourbon though; is this the future? Sourced whiskey."
1187,9,"The barrel staves used to age this whiskey dried outside in the open for 13 months. The oak influence is certainly evident—both from the cured oak staves and from the fact that the whiskey is 17 years old—but never overpowers. Plentiful spice notes (especially cinnamon and vanilla) are tamed by lovely sweetness (toffee dates nougat) and energized by bright fruit. Long dry warming finish. One of the better Taylors."
1188,7,"At 10 years old and 50% ABV you’d expect this whiskey to pack a power punch and while it does present solid oak and beautiful cinnamon spice it does so with great finesse. This barrel of Henry McKenna is a great showcase of many classic bourbon notes: caramel cinnamon oak orange clove and kettle corn. The flavors are well integrated balanced and backed by a wonderfully lush undertone. A solid finish that cools slightly caps off a textbook affable whiskey. (Drink Up New York only)"
1189,12,"Orange lemon peel iced tea cinnamon and blueberry jam aromas are undercut by earthy notes of mulch chili powder cracked corn and dill. Oak leads the flavor parade but is well-tempered by raspberry pomegranate cinnamon orange licorice walnuts and black pepper. Chocolate more pomegranate chili powder and silky oak round out this lush bourbon which shows impressive maturity for its 2 years."
1190,2,"Nashville barbecue icon Carey Bringle filters this whiskey through hickory charcoal bottling it under the name of his restaurant. A candied nose of saltwater taffy and bubble gum followed by peanut butter maple syrup vanilla cake banana cracked pepper and spicy oak. The palate offers almond chocolate coconut tobacco brown sugar and blueberry pie. Water brings out rich milk chocolate strawberry jam and cherry cobbler. The finish is smooth and flavorful with more chocolate nuttiness coconut tobacco and oak."
1191,8,"Lots of dried fruit figs and caramel lead off this bold but balanced bourbon as dark berry fruits smack of sweet crème de cassis on the palate. There’s a good bit of spice here like hot and spicy peanuts that meets the sweet fruit and vanilla. Shows great length and nice polish on the finish with its dusty oak and cocoa."
1192,11,"Hot barrel wood like opening a rickhouse in July; light allspice vanilla and fiery alcohol. Drinkable without water surprisingly. Hot syrup corn sugar caramel tannic oak and a bit of stickiness. An interesting look at Jack Daniel’s: unblended undiluted untamed. It’s still Jack—sweet insistent—but it’s taller bigger. I could say I’d like even more heft more complexity…but would that be asking Jack to be something it simply is not?"
1193,9,"Yes 23 years is a long time to age bourbon. And yes there’s plenty of oak influence. But there’s an underlying sweetness that balances the oak spice (with this particular cask; others may vary). Chewy in texture with toffee dates fig cake (with nuts) barrel char tobacco leather and a dusting of cocoa."
1194,12,"Hugely herbal from the start: coriander seed licorice dill and black tea aromas with some grape and blueberry jam lemon and oak. Sweet fruit tempers the herbaceous and mineral palate; layers of cooked berry Coca-Cola cherries lemon oil and peanuts create a silky rounded profile all tied up with generous oak. Finished in Black Bird Cider Works hard cider casks."
1195,12,"Made with 30% malted rye in the mashbill this bourbon has peanut brittle pecans maple syrup dark chocolate soft baking spice and lemon peel in iced tea on the nose. The palate shows rich maturity with dark chocolate oak coffee bean cola spices and plenty of nuts while a brighter fruit flavor layers itself on top: raspberry jam on a chocolate muffin. Cocoa powder coffee bean and roasted pecans on the gentle lingering finish."
1196,13,"The nose is vegetal with celery caraway seeds and bell pepper while also sweet: confectionery powder candied orange slices chocolate fudge and coffee ice cream. The palate shows wood influence though fruits—apricots and orange marmalade—emerge with water. The dry nutty finish has a sweet herbal quality that lingers before a final hint of tobacco smoke. A bit quirky but the well-structured clean flavors and excellent balance make this worth a taste."
1197,2,"Finished in Jamaican allspice barrels for six months. Candied bakery shop notes on the nose with grape jelly cherry cola vanilla and abundant spice. A burst of cooked dark fruit greets the palate followed by bitter chocolate coffee and fragrant oak. A warming finish offers more spice candied kiwi and chocolate. Powerful and spiced with subtly interwoven flavors and superbly balanced oak. (24000 bottles)"
1198,2,"A selection of bourbons distilled and aged in Tennessee Indiana and Kentucky. Drying autumn leaves on the nose along with leather tobacco leaf ginger snaps cherries nutmeg black tea vanilla toasted coconut and light orange. The mouthfeel is rich and leads with coconut and unsalted butter then cinnamon cloves red apple oak and more orange. Minerality peppery heat and tobacco on the finish as well as dark chocolate and cherry."
1199,5,"Rich and bold it’s loaded with caramel notes that range from macchiato to salted caramel chews. Then complexity sets in with brown sugar vanilla cake batter cinnamon-dusted molasses cookies candied pecans brown-sugar butter and cornbread. The key here is that each note appears with that initial caramel richness and follows this to the long warm and satisfying finish with a hint of spice."
1201,9,"Deeper and darker than some Four Roses but with plenty of bright lush sweetness. Notes of toffee honey-drenched nuts and ripe summer fruit. Nicely spiced with cinnamon nutmeg and a dusting of mocha. I just love the honey influence. A well-balanced whiskey with all the flavors taking turns to shine. Great integration of flavors too! One of my favorite Four Roses single barrel bourbons which will grow on you with every sip."
1202,5,"Cotton candy marshmallows roasting over an open campfire baked apples and cornbread batter start a whiskey that then offers hints of caramel apples pumpkin pie and roasted pecans. Water opens it up to more nuanced fruit spice and sweetness. Without water brown-sugar butter dominates about mid-palate and leads to a long finish. Dilution makes this a completely different whiskey experience."
1203,9,"The folks at Angel’s Envy once again push the envelope with this 95% rye whiskey finished in Caribbean rum casks. Vibrant spicy rye notes (cinnamon and mint) are tamed by rich maple syrup graham cracker crust nutty toffee candy floss subtle tropical fruit and creamy vanilla. Warm spicy rummy finish. This is a mood whiskey—not one I would drink every day—but the flavors marry nicely and the sweetness tames this high-testosterone rye whiskey. Bonus points for uniqueness. Editor's Choice"
1204,9,"Very graceful with a nice balance of youth and maturity. Gently sweet notes of toffee fig nougat and maple syrup spiked with cinnamon and vanilla. Dark berried fruit and a hint of coconut round out the palate. Perilously more-ish bourbon with a very easy-going demeanor. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
1205,12,"Comforting aromas of fresh-brewed espresso roasted pecans warm arepas chocolate-covered peanuts Italian hot cocoa mint chocolate and hints of black cherry and grape. There’s a rich tactile boldness on the palate with flavors of cinnamon peppermint black pepper cigar wrapper barrel char and lots of high-quality dark chocolate. The full finish has more dark chocolate charred oak spiced coffee bean and hints of cigar. (450 bottles)"
1206,2,"The nose offers notes of leather oak chocolate blackberry and baking spice. The mouthfeel is smooth but with heat and power as well as rich flavors of honey cinnamon blackberry tart bitter chocolate roasted peanuts and leather. On the finish come playful flavors of baking spice cherry tart more blackberry tobacco and white pepper. An excellent blend of spice and chocolate with playful berry notes—rich powerful and delicate all at once. (2500 bottles)"
1207,2,"The nose offers cherry raspberry tart dried orange slices butterscotch black pepper and antique closet. The palate is powerful with sweet syrup up front bold flavors of herbs and spice grain dusty oak and an earthy note of warehouse floor. More spice emerges with water bringing semi-sweet chocolate cooked raspberries and leather. Creamy and well-balanced with its spice tempered by deep chocolate cooked cherries and a musty yet interesting character."
1208,2,"A high-rye bourbon with the same mashbill as 1792 Small Batch this whiskey will be an annual limited release. The nose offers an inviting medley of chocolate-covered cherries pound cake buttered toast blackberry and licorice. The palate is mellow and honeyed with notes of cedar chocolate chip cookies blackberry jam coconut shavings and cigar wrapper all completed by a finish of brown sugar chocolate peanut shell and cracked pepper."
1209,2,"This Tennessee bourbon was bottled by non-distiller producer The Louisville Bourbon Transit Co. The nose offers toasted oak blueberry pie bakery shop caramel cinnamon spice and bitter orange. A smooth palate of milk chocolate melted caramel blackberry and black pepper is followed by a lightly spiced finish that offers more chocolate as well as balanced oak vanilla coconut flakes and almond. Spice melds with sweeter bourbon notes to create a unique flavorful whiskey. (1048 bottles)"
1210,2,"A portion of this limited-release straight bourbon is aged in new charred oak quarter casks which enable more contact with the wood. The nose offers vanilla licorice dried herbs red fruit confectionary sugar iced tea and orange peel. A chewy palate shows off the oak influence and has notes of spice chocolate-covered candied oranges blackberry compote cinnamon and peppercorns. Drying oak on a finish of dark cherry chocolate orange and cola."
1211,8,"This is autumn in a glass like jumping into a pile of dried leaves. Notes of sassafras and shredded chewing tobacco lead to aromas of spiced baked apple studded with cloves and sprinkled with cinnamon. Water really ramps up vanilla delivering a burst of fizzy cream soda. The palate offers maple syrup sweetness orchard fruit root beer and spices balanced by leathery oak tannins before a long finish of chocolate nougat and candle wax."
1212,9,"Aged then finished in Bowman barrels that held Hardywood Park brewery gingerbread stout in between. A beautifully spicy bourbon—but not aggressively so—with cinnamon clove and nutmeg. The spice is presented on a bed of layered sweetness (vanilla caramel and soft maple syrup) rounded out by subtle candied fruit and nuts. Nicely rounded fun and easy to drink. One of my favorites so far from Bowman."
1213,9,"Quite lush—the port influence is clearly obvious and adds a degree of opulence to this bourbon. Notes of ripe cherry dipped in caramel then light molasses blend in with more traditional bourbon notes of vanilla and spice. A pleasant diversion from the bourbon norm and ideal for postprandial consumption. (It begs for a fine cigar for those inclined.)"
1214,8,"This is a bold whiskey that meanders leisurely through a lot of flavor territory. The sweet aromas span toasted coconut nougat and marzipan coupled with distinctive meaty smoked bacon and cherry cough drop notes. Cherry and red berry fruit also string through the palate with bright citrus chili-pepper honey and flickers of spice—allspice and clove—dancing through the sweetness on a long finish."
1215,8,"Instantly evokes buttered pancakes drowning in maple syrup but on closer inspection there is a lot of depth here with a distinct charred-hickory note that suggests smoked meat or back bacon. Flavors slowly steer closer to the Jack profile with tropical fruit grape soda and Pez candies on the finish lingering with a note of spent tobacco pipe."
1216,5,"High rye is evident with rounded baking spices up front leather muted caramel vanilla and a hint of tobacco. This ABV beast coasts with the warmth and richness of crème brûlée toffee cinnamon rock candy fruit and nutmeg. Oh wait there’s more. Smoke kicks in toward the end with marshmallow undertones and more cinnamon finishing strong with lasting spice. This is a cask strength sipper or a lovely bourbon on the rocks."
1217,5,"An 8 year old from Wild Turkey’s Warehouse G it’s classic Turkey on the nose with a little spice caramel nutmeg oak and slight hints of lavender. Then sautéed barley pecan shell brown sugar chewing tobacco and bittersweet chocolate. An earthy oak note blossoms with a layered caramel chew following this whiskey home to a medium finish. (Maisano’s Fine Wine and Spirits exclusive)"
1218,9,"A marriage of 13 to 16 year old bourbons honoring master distiller Jimmy Russell’s 60 years at Wild Turkey. It is a more conservative Turkey compared to many of the previous limited-edition releases. But still this is pleasant with caramel and creamy vanilla intertwined with soft candied orange cinnamon polished oak and a hint of evergreen. Nicely balanced very approachable but I would have preferred this at their signature 101 proof for added intensity."
1219,5,"The original Maker’s Mark tried and true and the same since the 1950s. The nose is consistent with a flare on the floral toffee and caramel roasted almonds and loads of vanilla. Just when you think you’ve tasted this a million times it offers candied fruit and pie crust with the final touches of praline and a hint of pecan shell."
1220,11,"Triple-distilled bourbon from Virginia. Actively aromatic blowing right out of the glass: tart berries hot corn oak and stick cinnamon. Hot but surprisingly soft and light for 50% (triple distillation?) with sweet corn and more of the berries wrapped in oak and a touch of char. Everything persists to the finish including the heat leading to a twist of oak at the end. Manages to be big but light at the same time."
1221,5,"The same mashbill as its sister brand Old Forester Woodford Reserve is an unknown combination from Brown-Forman’s Louisville and Versailles distilleries. There’s no age statement but Woodford is around 7 years old. The key here is balance. One note never overtakes the other; nutmeg mango baked apples cinnamon blueberry pie and vanilla seem to walk in perfect harmony. Then we find the gingerbread caramel and vanilla jumping into layers of smoke and spice."
1222,9,"Very straightforward and unassuming. Its greatest assets are its balance and drinkability rather than its flavors. Lovely sweet notes (caramel vanilla) orchard fruit golden raisin and spice (cinnamon nutmeg dusting of cocoa) leading to a smooth finish. Not the most distinctive or complex of the single barrel releases but just a joy to drink. In fact this is almost too drinkable. It’s a whiskey I feel would show better at a higher strength (say 45% or even 50%)."
1223,12,"Sugar cookie dough dried apple rings iced tea and an unconventional aroma of amaretto on the nose. The palate is spiced and chewy and full of grain character well-balanced by blackberries bittersweet apples dried cherries grated ginger chile-chocolate barrel char and a touch of savory umami. Tobacco coffee bean savory oak and tingling pepper on the finish."
1224,9,"Amber chestnut color. Rich sweet aromas of toffee maple syrup soft candied fruit and molasses balanced by an oaky dryness and subtle spice notes. Thicker and fuller in body than previous vintages with a somewhat silky texture. On the palate the whiskey begins smooth and sweet with notes of maple syrup toffee and soft ripe fruit gradually increasing in intensity as spice (vanilla subtle mint) and oak notes kick in. Lengthy finish."
1225,9,"This is an elegant whiskey with lots of finesse. Its primary flavors are vanilla mint and candied fruit. A touch of honey light toffee slight nuttiness and rum notes round out the palate. Very clean with a pleasingly dry finish. And nicely rounded too! Each year’s vintage is slightly different. Some have been quite rich and full in texture. This one is more subtle and teasing-and it’s one of the better ones."
1226,5,"It starts out with several forms of wood—split toasted charred and smoldering—and develops baking spices baked apple caramel popcorn and earth. A tingle hits throughout the palate as rounded notes of chocolate cabernet roasted marshmallow and white pepper develop over lingering vanilla. Candied corn and cinnamon butter develop into a medium to long finish. (36000 bottles)"
1227,5,"Chocolate vanilla cream fried pie and herbs offer insight into this opening round of a fabulous whiskey. Cornbread pecan pie roasted walnuts and chocolate-flavored coffee hit mid-palate followed by cinnamon roll pumpkin spice and mint. But the finish falls slightly short only offering a hint of caramel."
1228,5,"Toasted oak coffee cola molasses and campfire smoke linger over a French bakery and baking spices that are both interesting and appealing. Then chocolate hazelnut and nutmeg dominate in a dessert-style treat that later introduces custard banana cream pie and candy corn. Almond butter appears for the long finish.(Bottled in winter 2017; Kentucky only)"
1229,5,"A bourbon made with cherrywood-smoked barley in the mash. When chocolate and cherries meet instant joy can only be improved with roasted nuts sprinkled on top. That’s what happens here. It’s all there in the opening round followed by toasted oak tangerine pumpkin latte caramel-covered popcorn and more cherries from jam to pitted dark cherries and maraschino to cherry fried pie. If you love cherries this is a must-have."
1230,8,"Bright and citrusy this is a big handful of orange gumdrops mandarin slices in syrup and curaçao laced with lemon oil and baking spice. On the palate there is more fruit—grapefruit and melon—that comes wrapped in soft spices with the alluring flavors of root beer barrels and sassafras leaf. A medium-bodied whiskey that strikes a fine balance."
1231,13,"An intense grain quality is apparent on the nose with notes of burlap sack dried leaves shelled almonds and seven-grain bread crust. The palate is quite hot but presents as structured and vibrant with freshly sawn oak corn husks and with water added cinnamon Red Hots. The finish isn’t long but remains satisfying with cacao nibs tobacco leaf and peppery oak. The grain character is heavy here but the flavors work aided by the robust proof."
1232,9,"Richly textured -- almost chewy -- with toffee molasses nougat date candy corn ripe clementine and raisin peppered with dusty grain cocoa powder moss Play-Doh subtle mint and herbs. Not as crisp or clean on the palate as the Wild Turkey American Spirit 15 year old released a couple years ago (which I rated a 94) but it is still very good and rather therapeutic in nature. It makes for a nice digestif. This is a different style of Wild Turkey. There’s a good deal of wood influence. I suspect that some will like this a lot while others might not warm up to it as much. It took a few encounters for me to embrace it."
1233,9,"The oldest of the four in years and also the highest in alcohol. It has managed to maintain its balance of flavors and keep the oak notes from becoming too dominant. Bolder and more masculine than Rowan’s Creek but not as teasing or seductive. Still it’s a great effort."
1234,9,"A surprising amount of sweetness to balance the wood spice. Notes of pencil shavings glazed fruit candy corn vanilla fudge and bold polished leather on the finish."
1235,9,"Style: Bourbon Color: Honey gold Aroma: Subtle. Clean. Delicately spicy with notes of vanilla mint citrus and golden raisin. Palate: Like its aroma with a pot pourri of spices on the finish."
1236,9,"Aged 7 years 1 month and 7 days. Big and chewy with nutty toffee molasses nougat tobacco pencil shavings subtle
fruit and dried spice (cinnamon vanilla). Leather barrel char and a hint of licorice root on the finish. Big bold and very enjoyable."
1238,5,"At first it’s a confectionery delight with notes of cotton candy caramel burnt brown sugar and praline. Then a spice explosion hits as the caramel becomes more defined. We’re talking pumpkin pie spice with hints of allspice cardamom and clove. Tobacco and stone fruit develop toward the end. Alas its medium finish with a hint of oak doesn’t continue the complexity found on the palate."
1239,5,"A beautiful opening of oak butterscotch and fruit quickly becomes more pronounced in banana and pineapple. Then baked apple Bananas Foster caramel pudding and salt water taffy. Hints of smoke and paprika lurk but marzipan and orange blossom honey nail the landing. The finish doesn’t hold up to the palate only offering a hint of caramel. Very good but not quite outstanding."
1240,9,"Toffee and maple syrup cigars aged in cedar along with polished leather. Resinous grip on the finish balanced by dark caramelized sugars. Tastes older than its true age. 375ml"
1241,9,"Antique amber color. Mature aromas and flavors and wonderfully balanced. Notes of toffee charred oak marmalade assorted candied fruit soft leather and subtle spice. Pleasant lingering finish."
1242,13,"The flagship straight bourbon from Still Austin. There is a rich sweetness on the nose; vanilla angel food cake with sugared strawberries toasted marshmallow candied pecans maple syrup banana bread and berries and cream. A velvety palate showcases orange blossom honeysuckle chocolate-covered cherries and cream soda. The fairly consistent finish shows spiced orange and sweet oak. The structure here works well."
1243,9,"Keeping in the Weller tradition this one is a wheated bourbon. Some wheated bourbons although easy to drink can taste a bit too sweet without the spicy rye notes in there. The better ones are often aged a little longer and/or bottled at higher strengths where the wood and alcohol accompany the sweetness. You’ll find soothingly rich toffee caramel fudge dates and nougat brightened up by berried fruit and a hint of dusty corn. Gently sweet finish."
1244,9,"Amber chestnut color. Mature aromas of oak vanilla toffee and leather. A heavyweight bourbon with a huge flavor profile-oak leather and molasses turning quite dry with a spicy nutty finish that is very long and warming."
1245,9,"A “wheated” bourbon meaning that it doesn’t have the spicy rye notes found in a more traditional “ryed” bourbon. A pleasantly sweet easy-going well-balanced experience. Creamy vanilla caramel candied corn and ripe berried fruit  along with more subtle notes of glazed orange cocoa powder and wood shavings. If I were going to ease a new bourbon drinker into the category I might pick this one. (Bottled for Binny’s Beverage Depot)."
1246,5,"Think southern kitchen: cornbread sorghum and brown sugar. Then it blossoms into a more traditional spice-forward American whiskey with caramel vanilla baking spices black pepper habañero and jalapeño honey. Toward the end subtle herbs appear just before a long and spicy finish."
1247,5,"First it’s oak and leather then spices of a different sort dominate such as anise fennel and caraway. Then the usual suspects in a bourbon of this age: caramel vanilla leather oak nutmeg and slight hints of off-the-beaten-path notes: black pepper and sage. After a lovely medium-to-long finish with a strong note of toasted pecan this is for sure a good though not great sipping whiskey."
1248,9,"More oak intensity depth maturity and character than the standard Jim Beam white. Darker sugars too showing more caramel and light toffee less honeyed corn and vanilla (although those notes are certainly still present). Subtle mint and cinnamon spice along with soft fruit and light tobacco on the finish round out the flavor profile. A bourbon comfortably positioned between Jim Beam white and the more premium Signature Series releases."
1249,2,"A hint of caramel corn along with nutmeg oak char blackberry jam and earthy notes of wet clay and tea leaves. The palate has loads of spice black tea and a subtle earthiness. The finish brings on chile-pepper heat bitter chocolate burnt walnut cooked cherries and light herbaceousness. Very unusual successfully venturing outside the box with a deft mix of sweetness chocolate earthiness and spice."
1250,9,"A limited-edition (600 bottles) cask strength version of Angel’s Envy. More alcohol and more portwood influence than that standard release. Rich and lush in texture with a sweet personality. Notes of ripe berried fruit maple syrup honeyed tangerine vanilla and background spice. Distinctive with a soothing velvety finish. I’d prefer less port influence more aligned with the standard release but it’s still a very enjoyable bourbon. Best after dinner with a cigar."
1251,9,"Clean on the palate with honey-kissed citrus summer fruits crisp mint and cinnamon balanced by creamy vanilla and soft toffee. A solid bourbon that’s nicely rounded and vibrant. It’s very much with the current trend of American whiskeys toward no age statement; youthful and playful in nature and versatile."
1252,9,"The replacement to Four Roses “Mariage” limited editions which were a marriage of two different whiskey formulas. This new whiskey contains three of Four Roses’ ten different recipes. It tastes older and more mature than the standard Small Batch bottling—there’s a lot more oak dryness and spice especially on the finish. Along with the oak there’s plenty of fruit too (citrus pineapple apricot papaya) plus caramel-coated nuts a kiss of honeyed vanilla and complex dried spice (cocoa nutmeg cinnamon) kicking in on the finish. (Available September 2010.)"
1253,9,"Silky in texture and gently sweet. This new “Mariage Collection” release shows a softer more elegant side of Four Roses when compared to their other bottlings (including the most recent limited edition 120th Anniversary bottling which was a much bolder affair). Notes of candied fruit black raspberry blueberry creamy vanilla cornbread and chamomile tea. Delicately spicy too with a polished oak finish. Clean on the palate and very drinkable. Four Roses utilizes a wide variety of mash bills and yeast strains and has the ability to produce a diverse array of whiskeys. This “Mariage” offering is a good example."
1254,2,"A revival brand from Lux Row Distillers’ owner Luxco and part of a trio that also features a cabernet cask-finished bourbon and another finished in new toasted French oak casks. This one is herbal and earthy on the nose with a light note of citrus. The palate is delicate with flavors of vanilla cream cola and raspberry. Well-balanced and smooth on the finish ending with pleasant notes of spice."
1255,8,"A nose of mint and red and blue fruits suggests teaberry with crushed herbs adding savory appeal. On the palate the fruit really leaps forward; decadent black plum and red Hawaiian Punch turn ever-more dark and deep as raisin and currants meet distinctive clove and cinnamon-spice notes for a finish of Christmas cake. Unconventional but lovely in the way it combines lush sherried fruit with rye-like spice."
1256,8,"This evokes walking into a cabin deep in the woods surrounded by fresh cut oak as wisps of pine boughs and resin pour in on the wind along with earth and warm cocoa. The palate is pleasingly plush with vanilla sweetness that suggests orange Creamsicle almond pastry and plenty of toasty oak. There is also some fresh orange zest and grated ginger with only a gentle suggestion of spice."
1257,8,"French burnt peanuts caramel warming spice citrus and lots of varnish and solvent suggest some age here. However the palate never lacks for verve with juicy citrus drive including a bright key lime note grapefruit and some melon fruit that picks up more varnish and adhesive tape on the long finish."
1258,8,"Aromas of dusty basement varnish earthy spice and old leather reveal the whiskey’s age and the palate delivers plenty of complexity beautifully balancing sweet and bitter notes as violet candies meet orange pith. Candied walnuts and butterscotch flavors leap from the folds of a leather wallet. The finish brings allspice and nutmeg peanut brittle and more earthy oak."
1259,5,"Quince coconut raspberry and chocolate walk into an array of breads—sourdough cornbread Lebanese pita and pumpernickel rye. Soon a sweetness develops over earthiness. Think hazelnut latte paired with rich lentil soup followed by jalapeño cornbread and honey. Its strength never shows but that promise in the taste is not followed in the finish which is shorter than expected. If the finish held up it would be a much stronger whiskey."
1260,12,"Reunions are usually sweet and this is no exception with aromas of blackberry jam dark plums orange Popsicle grape candy almond and cracked grain. It turns nutty on the palate—roasted peanuts almond croissant—with raspberry jam and oatmeal cookie. The full and rounded finish continues the nutty jammy flavors along with oak and milk chocolate. Finished in red wine barrels that had previously been used to age Jack Daniel’s."
1261,5,"Caramel and earth on the nose with freshly tilled soil flowers and oak just before an explosion of caramel vanilla allspice and fruit. It really grows on you with a buttery mouthfeel that presents cinnamon honey cornbread marzipan pecan pie granola nutmeg-dusted pumpkin pie and a slight hint of candied ginger. Finishes long with rich caramel. Quite tasty."
1262,11,"Can you say “11 year old Old Grand-Dad”? There’s a snap of hot happy rye in the nose sweet corn and cinnamon banging along but there’s vanilla and oaky dryness. I had a bottle of OGD Bonded handy and it’s close. It’s like my favorite young bonded strapped in oaky spice with a more mature drier finish. I’m told this has even more rye in the mashbill. If you like OGD get this and see what more age does. Price is per 375 ml."
1263,8,"Crusty cornbread leads off in this Tennessee-distilled sweet-styled bourbon brimming with Bit-O-Honey Peanut Chews and banana taffy. While the bold sweetness and stone fruits take the lead there is enough tobacco-laced tannin and spice to back up and balance the initial sweetness as char-grilled corn flavors take this across the finish line and make it decidedly moreish."
1264,9,"Usually the sleeper of the Collection. Toffee mixed with cinnamon mocha añejo rum golden raisin dried citrus and tobacco with firm leather and oak on the finish. Last year’s release was more balanced and a great expression of the brand but I’m afraid this release is a little heavy on the oak; particularly on the finish. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2015 Release."
1265,9,"Light in body with creamy notes of vanilla and honey married with orchard fruit. All this is balanced by warming dried spice on the finish. Very enjoyable. Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection French Oak Barrel Aged Bourbon 2015 Release. Price is per 375 ml."
1266,9,"More caramelized sugars (caramel and toffee) with darker fruit than the 105 and 90. More oak spice influence too but balanced nicely by the sweeter notes. Mouth-coating viscous and lubricating in texture. Price is per 375 ml."
1267,9,"The third cask strength release and like all Angel’s Envy bourbons this one is finished in port barrels. When compared to the standard bottling this cask strength release is packed with more of everything. It’s lush and palate-coating. Fruit forward too with honey-coated cherries sultana ripe peach pineapple in syrup peppered with clove and vanilla and wrapped in a silky smooth finish. This whiskey pushes the envelope of port finishing."
1268,13,"There’s nice dimension to the nose with aromas of dried herbs orange oil walnuts black tea and a honeyed sweetness alongside candied orange peel. The well-developed palate offers zesty grapefruit and lemon and darker flavors underneath: root beer plums chocolate and blueberries. The interplay between crisp citrus and deeper earthier flavors creates intrigue. The finish unfolds further with bitter chocolate and oak. A lot is happening here with most of it in unison."
1269,2,"A blend of 9 year and 9 month 11 and 15 year old barrels from Tennessee Indiana and Kentucky. The combination creates complexity and balance starting with an aromatic nose of toasty oak cherry cinnamon nutmeg dried orange leather and cigar ash. The palate follows with notes of semi-sweet chocolate espresso peach cobbler and a hint of coconut. It concludes with a finish of more chocolate and subtle notes of fruit."
1270,5,"When spice meets fruit in whiskey it’s a beautiful thing. Here chili pepper melds with banana and pear then baking spices tumble into passion fruit. Next it’s cornbread vanilla ice cream hazelnut and brown sugar. Finally a touch of caramel appears toward the end where a medium but lovely finish takes it home. This will make a fine table whiskey for easy sipping."
1271,8,"A highlight of the Basil Hayden’s line for its cherry cough drop and clove-studded orange flavors that nicely match sweet fruit with spice. There is some intriguing earthiness—suggestions of a mushroom-covered tree stump. The light-bodied palate delivers modest apricot peppery oak and vanilla with sandalwood on the finish. Very nice flavors just a bit timid."
1272,9,"While last year’s vintage was a more delicate expression of Evan Williams I loved it for its elegance charm and balance (and gave it a 95 rating). This one is darker in flavor and bolder with more caramelized sugars (caramel toffee maple syrup) along with some underlying fruit. It’s also drier spicier and with more wood influence (resin and polished leather). It still maintains its balance on the nose and majority of the palate but with more wood on the finish than I would prefer to rate it in the 90s. (One more thing to consider: it’s a single barrel bottling and no two barrels are alike.) Value Pick"
1273,8,"Bit-O-Honey candies spearmint and beeswax introduce this seductively sweet whiskey. On the palate more honey notes green apple Jolly Rancher and grape jelly continue the vivid sweetness augmented by the sweet nuttiness of marzipan and honey peanut butter. A nicely executed and pretty whiskey finishing with candied almonds."
1274,12,"A sourced whiskey named for man’s best friend this well-aged bourbon is layered with sweet and spiced aromas and flavors. PayDay candy bars red Twizzlers honey caramel chews and gingerbread mingle with iced tea pipe tobacco and peanut shells on the nose. Flavors of bitter orange cherry soda grape jelly and roasted pecans are balanced by rich oak cinnamon and iced tea with gingerbread spices and bittersweet chocolate on the finish."
1275,9,"The fourth in a series of limited-edition Taylor bottlings and the first barrel-proof release. Layered sweet notes of caramel and nougat with bright orchard fruit (especially nectarine) dried spice (vanilla mint) and pencil shavings. The dried spice notes linger on the finish along with tobacco. Bourbon with attitude."
1276,2,"The nose offers caramel custard chocolate and maple syrup. An oak-driven palate has lots of heat and integrated spice but is also loaded with chocolate coffee beans almonds and maple syrup. The finish is the best part with rich notes of chocolate coffee and spice but plenty of finesse. Water brings out more chocolate on a slightly tart but rich finish. Lots of assertive flavors but with a gentle smooth texture."
1277,12,"Blending a 2 year old straight bourbon made at Ben Milam Distillery with two Tennessee straight bourbons (one aged 3 to 4 years and the other 10 to 11 years) this whiskey balances youth and maturity adeptly. The nose has peanuts cinnamon hot chocolate horehound candy and Coca-Cola syrup while on the palate orange cherries blueberries blackberries peanuts pepper allspice and cinnamon are held in balance by the oak. The finish rides a good length with chili-chocolate roasted peanuts oak and a hint of tobacco leaf."
1278,2,"Rabbit Hole’s core bourbon brand now carries the name Cavehill though the liquid remains unchanged. The nose starts with dried red fruits drying oak tannins raspberry jam and an earthy note. A palate of spiced oak milk chocolate caramel white pepper and sweet black cherry is followed by a lengthy finish of orange peel honey sweet lemon cake creamy chocolate and pepper spice. Rich flavors creating an easy whiskey to savor."
1279,2,"This four-grain bourbon (corn rye malt caramel malt and honey malt) starts with aromas of herb garden and notes of strawberry dried apricot orange and licorice. There’s more apricot and orange on the palate as well as candied almonds tiramisu light oak and pepper spice. The finish has maltiness and is also spiced and nutty with chocolate sauce and an earthy back note. Rich and sweet with balanced herbs and spice."
1280,2,"A blend of 4 to 12 year old bourbons including some made at Sonoma County’s Graton Distilling Co. along with bourbons from Kentucky Indiana and Tennessee. Named after Pipe Dream a giant redwood near the distillery. An herbaceous nose offers spearmint spice tea and leather. Coconut on the palate followed by orange oil peach pie vanilla brown sugar and chocolate-covered almonds. The finish has spice nutty dark chocolate espresso and melon. Cohesive balanced and well-textured."
1281,9,"Well-defined flavors and clean on the palate. Wood is the driving influence here showing plenty of dried spice throughout with a dry resinous finish. The spice notes are accompanied by a layer of caramel dried spice (vanilla cinnamon nutmeg) and subtle orchard fruits. The dry oak notes overstay their welcome for balance. Otherwise it’s a very pleasant whiskey. Price per 375 ml."
1282,5,"A combination of 7 year old year rye finished in port barrels and 11 year old wheated and rye bourbons. It presents exceptionally fruity aromas with prominent plum and floral hints fresh-cut grass toasted pecan burnt butter brown sugar and a touch of chocolate. On the palate there are warm cinnamon apples fried donut with caramel icing and a hint of dry popcorn. The medium finish offers lovely toffee. Sourced whiskey."
1283,2,"1884 references the final year Nathan “Nearest” Green the former slave now known as the first African-American distiller made whiskey before retiring. A nose of blossom honey fresh cherries banana cream pie licorice and spice is followed by a palate that’s delicate and creamy with notes of vanilla frosting orange peanuts marshmallow and light pepper spice. Tobacco leaf on the finish with cherry oak and understated spice. A sturdy finessed exemplar of Tennessee style."
1284,9,"Sweeter notes of pecan pie dates sweet corn candied fruit and English toffee combine with dried spices -- cinnamon heat vanilla and mint -- which crescendoes on its long dry finish. A nicely matured bourbon with decent weight to it. Some of the expressions in the earlier part of the decade were a little heavy on the oak but the last couple of years have shown greater balance."
1285,9,"Barton 1792 distillery’s first-ever wheated bourbon where the wheat replaces rye as the ‘spice’ ingredient (similar to Weller and Maker’s Mark). A sweet and fruity whiskey with vanilla wafer cotton candy caramel custard blackberry and ripe peach. Soft oak spice and polished leather on the finish keep the sweetness in check. Very gentle in personality; a great starter bourbon."
1286,5,"The nose tickles with caramel spice vanilla and earthiness with just a hint of balsamic vinegar.  Warming. Coated with spices ranging from cinnamon to allspice and from coffee to nutmeg. Eventually patented caramel and vanilla with a fun hint of cardamom. The long enjoyable finish is earthy but there’s an unwanted bitterness at the end that cannot be denied. If not for the bitter end this would rate much higher."
1287,9,"Each of these three bourbons was distilled and bottled at the same time and aged in the same warehouse for 12 years and 3 months. The main variable was the floor they were aged on. In theory the higher up in the warehouse the greater the temperature variation and the more wood influence. Does the experiment support this general concept? Yes with the sweet spot being the middle floor.

Soft and sweet oozing caramel honeyed vanilla and gentle ripe orchard fruit. Soft gently sweet finish. Not the most complex of the three in this experiment but it’s very easy-going and soothing on the palate. A nice pairing for a cigar where the sweet notes will marry nicely with the cigar’s dried spice. Price is per 375 ml."
1288,11,"Plenty of color and the nose says it ain’t lying. Sharp warehouse oak aroma puts an edge on an authoritative nose of honey Indian pudding spicy hard candy and old-fashioned root beer the not-too-sugary kind. Fiery and bold on the tongue as oak roars from start to finish but the sweetness builds sip-by-sip: cornbread buckwheat honey King syrup and a teasy bit of citrus peel. Long finish as the oak dies down. At this price let’s keep it our secret. Sourced whiskey."
1289,9,"Deeper darker more intense than the Barrel Head Aged expression. Toffee pit fruit Earl Grey tea cinnamon pencil shavings and tobacco lead to a tannic gripping finish. The French oak influence is tangible. Price is per 375 ml."
1324,5,"Think cherries—they dominate the nose over earth oak and blueberries. Then it’s leather tobacco cigar box and burnt pie crust edges. Finally two notes become one as cherry pie with hints of rhubarb and cola. It sets itself up to be a prime whiskey but the notes just fall off on a short finish. If only the backbone held up this could be remarkable stuff."
1290,9,"A set of two 100% rye whiskeys triple distilled in copper pot stills with the difference between them being the type of barrels in which they were aged. One was matured in a new charred cask while the other one was aged in a used cask. They are packaged in half-bottle sizes (375 ml) and sold as a set for $100.
Dark in color and deep on the palate. Plenty of weight too. A base of caramel with warming cinnamon persistent mint brandy-soaked apple tobacco polished leather and oak grip on the finish."
1291,9,"After a false start several years back it’s a pleasure to finally see Four Roses Single Barrel available here in the U.S. This whiskey is nicely balanced with a teasing subtleness to it. I particularly enjoy its delicately honeyed floral crisply spicy aroma with underlying notes of vanilla cream and candied fruit. These flavors follow through on the palate initially with honey-laced fruit caramel and soft vanilla notes leading to a dry spiciness (mint cinnamon) and refined oak. It finishes crisp and pleasingly dry. None of the flavors are dominant and bottling it at 50% is a bonus."
1292,5,"Effervescent tingly mouthfeel but the flavor begins after the initial warmth with hints of caramel apple pumpkin pie apricot and a slight hint of caramel popcorn. Then it’s pumice apricot and marmalade followed by salt water taffy cinnamon and a big burst of nutmeg. A long finish offers a hint of peach pie."
1293,12,"Initially reticent on the nose with time this reveals gooey caramel pralines Hershey’s milk chocolate and a touch of charred mint leaves. It’s chewy and occasionally sharp on the palate with oodles of roasted nuts polished oak mint peppery spice dark chocolate licorice tobacco ash and char. The medium-length finish holds tingling white pepper unsweetened chocolate and more polished oak."
1294,9,"The fourth in the series of limited-edition bottlings and one of the better ones. The impact on the whiskey of finishing in barrels made with staves that have been seasoned three to five years really is evident here. There’s plenty of wood spice and I think it goes well with the sweet pot still characteristics. On the nose the flavors are nicely intertwined. But on the palate the sweeter notes (caramel nutty toffee fig ripe berries black cherry) appear first with the dry spicy notes (cinnamon clove cocoa powder vanilla polished leather maduro tobacco) building to a firmly dry finish. Perhaps the dryness on the finish overstays its welcome more than I would like. But still this is a solid effort -- and quite distinctive!"
1295,12,"The unusual use of millet as the secondary grain for this bourbon creates an utterly unexpected flavor profile closer to the familiar notes of rye. It works well but the blind drinker may be taken unawares. Freshness dominates the nose with balsam bough spruce branches mint toothpaste and Pine-Sol and it pervades the palate too which is green and peppy with arugula spearmint pine black pepper and lemon. The finish shows bitter oak but remains persistently piney and fresh."
1296,12,"Licorice charcoal smoke cured tobacco black pepper pencil eraser and bicycle tires on the nose—but don’t be put off those are attractive notes in a whiskey that’s making sooty phenols one of its central selling points. The palate is dry and peppery with savory notes of mole sauce roasted nuts and coffee bean along with peppermint and dry-roasted spices. It finishes with black pepper bittersweet chocolate more roasted nuts and persistent char."
1297,9,"Nice effort overall. My gut feeling is that this whiskey might have been better a couple years ago but I wouldn’t call the second barrel impact excessive. It’s rich and smooth with sweeter notes of caramel rich vanilla and subtle candied fruit underpinned by firm spice (especially cinnamon) which kicks in on the finish. It comes across as very traditional bourbon with perhaps a little extra oak impact on the back end. Price is per 375 ml."
1298,8,"Quite confectionery and billowing with fruity candies—banana taffy bubble gum Pixy Stix red cinnamon gumdrops and Swedish Fish. The palate offers black cherry soda more banana and a bit of grapefruit. Very fruity with just enough oak to deliver a drying finish. Fans of Jack will be like kids in the candy store with the added proof and intensity. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
1299,9,"My favorite of the two [Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Giant French Oak Barrel]. Surprisingly sweet with layers of caramel butterscotch nougat and subtle creamy vanilla.  This whiskey defies its age. A blend of dried spice on the nose and the finish of the palate balances the sweetness. A very enjoyable (and drinkable) whiskey. Price is per 375 ml."
1300,9,"This first limited-edition Taylor release attempts to recreate the “sour mash” process used a century ago. Sweet on the nose and palate (fruit gumdrops sweet corn vanilla wafer). Spicy too (cinnamon evergreen) and clinging on the palate. The sweetness is rescued late with a firm dry oak finish. Reminds me of an exhilarating rollercoaster ride that puts the brakes on at the end. Not the most balanced but certainly distinctive."
1301,2,"A Tennessee whiskey using wheat (instead of rye) as the flavoring grain. New leather mint dusty warehouse floor pink pastilles gingerbread caramel and dark fruits on the nose. Cinnamon up front on the palate followed by brown sugar chocolate raspberry vanilla wafers allspice and black pepper. The finish is lightly oaked with creamy vanilla more cinnamon and allspice. A delicate but flavorful profile with balanced sweetness and spice."
1302,9,"Quite bold and crisply spicy. The most palate-piercing of the three. Well defined flavors of cool mint warming cinnamon honey-kissed fruit and caramel. Briskly spicy finish. When I nose this whiskey it feels like it’s brandishing a sword at me and shouting “en garde!”"
1303,9,"The same vintage as last year’s Birthday Bourbon but aged one year longer. Last year’s version was quite intense with a lot of wood influence. What does one more year in wood do to the whisky? Surprisingly the oak spice seems less dominant and the flavors are more balanced. Still this is still a serious bourbon drinker’s bourbon. Piquant dried spice notes of vanilla cocoa mint and cinnamon are tamed by layers of maple syrup caramel and toffee. Every once in a while some fruits try to get recognized. A powerful after dinner bourbon."
1304,9,"“Extra-aged” bourbon finished in Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. The third Distiller’s Masterpiece release the previous two being over a decade ago. The PX sherry is certainly evident with its lush dark fruit (raisin prune ripe plum) marmalade and
layered dark sugars (toffee molasses maple syrup). A peppering of spices (cinnamon allspice vanilla) and dry resinous oak round out the palate. Certainly a mood whiskey. Perhaps with a cigar after dinner? (distillery only)"
1305,9,"Nicely balanced with interwoven soft vanilla cinnamon and citrus all on a bed of light toffee and caramel. More subtle notes of marzipan tropical fruit and soft oak add complexity. Traditional in style with a friendly demeanour. A good bourbon to have on hand as it is very versatile. I would have preferred this bottled at 45-50% but this will do just fine as it is. A new regular bottling."
1306,13,"From New York’s Denning’s Point Distillery this bourbon was aged for 4 years. Sawdust and chestnuts on the nose along with sprinklings of cinnamon allspice and clove. Clean barrel and grain flavors permeate the palate: peppermint hard candies cinnamon gum peanut shells and fresh-cut wood. There is plenty of oak and spice on the finish rounded out with a touch of savory tobacco."
1307,13,"The nose is at times sweet fruity herbal and minty with notes of grape Kool-Aid strawberry lemonade Ricola cough drop and pine needles. With water more herbaceous aromas emerge and temper the very sweet fruitiness. The herbal notes are gentle yet persuasive though the palate has a hard time finding its feet with baking spices nuts and chocolate vying for attention. More grape and a touch of peppery spice on the finish."
1308,9,"The last time I reviewed this whiskey was back in 2004 and this new bottling is an improvement. It’s beefier thicker and richer with a good dose of rye spice. Very nice! Good balance of flavors on the nose and palate with caramel custard bright fruit (clementine golden raisin orange marmalade) a peppering of spice (fresh mint warming cinnamon dried vanilla) green tea a hint of toasted marshmallow and a pleasing dried oak tobacco-tinged finish. Lots of character!"
1309,12,"Granola bar notes of toasted oats honey chocolate chips and sweet nuts on the nose along with blueberries vanilla orange blossom and a touch of spice. Creamy vanilla latte dark chocolate dried cherries peppermint and root beer spices on the palate which benefits from a drop of water. The finish has more spice a sheen of mint oil savory oak and coffee bean."
1310,13,"Aged 6 years. A dark earthy woodsy character gives this whiskey definition bringing notes of cedar and pine cones on the nose along with eucalyptus maple syrup brown sugar and—when water is added—lemon balm and dried apricots. The palate shows consistency robust with dried mint orange peel dark chocolate roasted walnuts and a touch of licorice. Tangy citrus highlights the warming finish along with cacao nibs and savory oak."
1311,5,"Initially there’s a lot going on. Bakery confectionary meets spice rack followed by dried oak toasted oak covered baked apples canned peaches and dried apricot. Then tobacco and leather strike before mouth-coating butterscotch and vanilla icing. Once these notes dissipate lighter baked fruits and jams walk this into a medium finish. While good this whiskey could have been great if it maintained its initial complexity."
1312,9,"Bolder with more spice than other Elmer T. Lee single barrel offerings I’ve tried over the years. A bit more vibrant too. Fresh notes of cinnamon vanilla wood shavings ground black pepper clove subtle tobacco and a hint of nutmeg on a bed of caramel and honeyed orchard fruit. Firm warming spicy finish. Most releases I’ve had were mellower and smoother (the 90th Birthday release comes to mind) but this is very dynamic and vibrant."
1313,2,"A nose of cinnamon Red Hots and spiced oak with eucalyptus cracked pepper herbaceousness and minerality. The palate is somewhat hot offering pepper spice and oak tannins but soft in texture with notes of vanilla pastry strawberry shortcake raspberry jam baking spices and roasted nuts. Water adds more nuttiness as well as dark chocolate. A smooth finish of dark chocolate spice and tobacco. Somewhat oak forward but showing good maturity."
1314,12,"Roasted corn peanut butter vanilla extract orange wedges root beer and licorice on the nose. The palate is oak-driven chewy and dense carrying along an herbaceous streak that showcases dill cedar licorice and black pepper as well as peanuts orange oil and roasted corn. A few drops of water showcase the grain and nuts to even better advantage. Distilled in Indiana and aged in Georgia."
1315,8,"Honey-roasted peanuts maple syrup and stone fruits are underscored by deep earthy notes of tobacco leaf dried apple sassafras leaves and candied nuts. The palate expresses some tropical dried pineapple fruit and sweet butterscotch turning full and spicy with pleasant chocolate and cinnamon hearts candies lending lots of verve and some complexity on the medium finish. Best Values"
1316,2,"Floral and quite delicate on the nose with notes of grape rose petals red berries honey baked apples cinnamon vanilla cookies allspice dill cucumber and fragrant oak. The palate is nutty up front followed by orange peel vanilla tobacco leaf cinnamon roasted walnuts and toasted oak. Water brings out brighter racier flavors of chocolate. The finish is golden apples honey bitter chocolate roasted pecans and a balanced rich sweetness."
1317,2,"The nose is unorthodox but not unpleasant. Herbal with notes of dill and potpourri with licorice figs coconut and brown sugar following. The palate comes into focus with traditional flavors of fragrant vanilla marshmallow and bubble gum as well as coconut chocolate-covered almonds popcorn and pepper spice. The finish is lengthy presenting baking spice cracked pepper and polished oak. Unusual in profile but combining bitter herbal notes with very traditional flavors."
1318,2,"Minty and herbal on the nose with notes of fresh oak licorice apricots brown sugar dried apples orange peel peaches light coconut ginger and dried leaves. The palate is sweet up front with a complex melding of butterscotch spicy oak orange slices and chocolate fudge. The finish offers lots of spice black pepper bitter chocolate and a pleasant note of almond nuttiness. A well-textured whiskey with lots of spice and heat."
1319,13,"From Huber’s Orchard Winery & Vineyards in Indiana comes this well-made whiskey with elements of originality and surprise. Hickory wood spice cinnamon candy and coffee cake on the nose. The palate is full of spice with some tropical fruit—mango and guava—plus good balance and body. These notes shine brighter without water. Guava carries over to the palate where it’s joined by mint more cinnamon and oak. This is one to keep an eye on as stocks mature. (Best Value)"
1320,9,"Woodford’s first permanent line extension. Aged in two barrels with different toast and char amounts.  More visceral than the standard Woodford Reserve with a darker personality extra wood spice and a nice sweet foundation. Notes of cinnamon stick dark berried fruit roasted nuts caramel creamy vanilla and polished leather."
1321,5,"Launched in 2015 this is a solid pick for the under-$30 club. Think butterscotch and caramel dripping over popcorn: the cooked sugars first then corn kernels. Dulled spices oak vanilla hints of saddle leather and earth. This isn’t complex or complicated but the medium-to-long candy corn finish leaves me wondering about its status with two more years in the barrel. Of course that would mean the price would go up too."
1322,5,"It begins with corn pudding savory and sweet developing into cornbread cookie dough and tapioca pudding. This is followed by cinnamon bread raw walnut and malt. Around mid-palate a dominating spice kicks in. This spice remains toward the finish where the cinnamon just pleasantly sits there. Fun sipper."
1325,5,"There’s a lot going on here: rich caramel soft vanilla gingerbread cookies straight from the oven cinnamon marzipan honey and peach. Then it’s a dance of the caramel/vanilla-combo richness with brown sugar butter and toffee. The thing is you need to appreciate barrel strength whiskey to capture its essence as the beasty alcohol overpowers. Even barrel strength lovers will find a splash of water opens it up giving more caramel walnut and whoopie pie. Long caramel finish."
1326,11,"“Tennessee bourbon” at 8 years 3 months and barrel proof. This and Batch 006 are the same whiskey the same age from different warehouse floors. Smooth sweet nose of oak and hot corn. Quite spicy on the tongue hard-dancing oak vaults high in the mouth over a strong sweet body. Solid oaky finish. Honest and foursquare as a Tennessee farmer; no surprises but no disappointments either. Sourced whiskey."
1327,9,"Dark big and brooding. A mouthful of oak spice resin and leather. Surprisingly (and happily) the oak is never excessive — even on the finish. A mélange of toffee maple syrup and candy corn props it all up. The flavors aren’t as well defined as its sibling release (reviewed above) and there’s a peculiar hint of “dunnage warehouse” (think damp earth) to it that adds intrigue. A very characterful whiskey worthy of debate. Price is per 375ml."
1328,11,"Triticale is a rye-wheat hybrid so I’m expecting a rye-wheater hybrid bourbon. What I get is a screamer: spicy slice of a nose hot cinnamon and sawn dry oak. Surprisingly light in the mouth which is putting a smile on my face. Oak races through this a spine coated with sweet grain spicy notes a bit of creaminess and as the oak wraps up I realize: no real rye bitterness. Cool stuff a very good one. Price is per 375 ml."
1329,9,"Caramel and vanilla notes with a peppering of spice (primarily cinnamon but also evergreen cocoa teaberry and nutmeg) and subtle roasted walnut finishing dry gritty and spicy (from the grains and also the oak). Spicier and not as sweet when compared to its sibling Jim Beam Black an eight year old. There’s certainly a lot going on here. A very “busy” and intriguing whiskey for exploring and discussing. (Exclusive to Travel Retail.)€30"
1330,9,"Many of the Birthday Bourbon releases are wood driven and this one is particularly so. Very spicy with warming cinnamon and cool mint. Roasted nuts tropical fruit (coconut pineapple) tangerine and apricot emerge occasionally along with a foundation of vanilla and caramel. Firm resinous grip on the finish."
1331,12,"Aromas of peanuts sassafras Cheerwine soda nutty oak and a sweep of cloves allspice and ginger sprinkled with blackberries and cherries. There’s zippy citrus on the palate a nice lift of heavier oak roasted nut dark chocolate and baking spice flavors. But the richness stops short on the finish which is light and quick. (Total Wine & More)"
1332,9,"The first in a series of limited edition releases for 2015. Not as rich thick sweet or deep as last year’s classic 25th Anniversary bottling. This one’s lighter drier and with more spice. Cinnamon mint nutmeg licorice root citrus and subtle botanical notes all wrapped up in caramel and vanilla. Dry pleasant finish. If the 25th Anniversary bottling was an ideal digestif this one is more suitable as an aperitif."
1333,11,"Diageo has “brought I.W. Harper home” after years of absence from the U.S. market with this bottling and a base bottling (see below). The source is “new” Bernheim but with a different mashbill from the base; this is 86% corn. Nose is warm corn and oak with some spicy clove and cinnamon notes. Great medium-weight body and balance palate repeats the nose oaky-sweet finish; well-integrated whiskey. But my eyes pop at the price."
1334,2,"Cinnamon stick baked apple raisin prune and brown sugar on the nose along with lime and a hint of rancio. The palate is refined offering milk chocolate almond cherry baked apple cinnamon and ginger. Water brings gentle spice and the madeira note. The finish is gentle and flavorful with notes of chocolate fudge more cherry and soft oak. Elegant and rich with the madeira cask contributing much finesse and flavor."
1335,2,"A blend of high-rye bourbons (30% rye) aged 6 to 8 years. A warm welcoming nose with pleasant dunnage warehouse earthiness toasted oak maple syrup cinnamon blackberries grape candy licorice and an herbal note. A racy palate offers candied citrus cherry and apricot as well as bitter chocolate caramel cinnamon spice and pepper. Light and delicate on the finish with milk chocolate almond orange and more cinnamon. Delicate smooth sweet and balanced."
1336,12,"Part of Wild Turkey’s Whiskey Barons Collection which re-creates brands lost during Prohibition. A blend of 4 and 6 year old charcoal-filtered bourbons with a nose of cereal vanilla lemon cake orange and baking spice. The palate brings out vanilla caramel cinnamon walnuts peach pie licorice pipe tobacco and a halo of chili pepper. The finish has kick and heat with notes of honey lemon chocolate and spicy oak."
1337,8,"Sweet candy shop nougat and honeycomb flavors are underscored by some funky earth and mushroom notes. The palate is sweet and lively delivering orange peel and subtle hints of baking spice. Overall a pleasant pour with the only criticism that it feels rather light-bodied with the oak a bit sharp. Adding water makes this bourbon feel underpowered and hollow but it is a fine sipper otherwise."
1338,2,"This bourbon is finished for 5 months in pinot noir barrels from Willamette Valley’s Elk Cove Vineyards. The nose offers toasted spicy oak orange Creamsicle clementines and lime leaf but is also herbal with light notes of dill and white pepper. Oak-driven on the palate spicy and nutty with citrus oil and espresso. A smooth finish offers dark chocolate roasted almonds coconut and tobacco leaf and becomes fruitier with water."
1339,9,"Very much in the Elijah Craig style: thick and chewy with layers of toffee molasses and vanilla cream. Notes of caramel-nut fudge cinnamon bun and blackberry brandy keep it fun. There’s just the right amount of dried oak spice on the finish to round things out. Very good solid affordable bourbon. (Capital City Package exclusive.)"
1340,2,"A fruit-driven nose offers scents of apple bananas coconut and poached pears in addition to sweeter notes of red licorice almond sweet iced tea and clove. The palate is quite different—hot and spicy—accompanied by notes of dark chocolate espresso and oak tannin. The finish turns rich and chocolaty with honey cherry watermelon jelly fruit slices cigar box coconut peach cherry and aromatic oak. Much on offer here though it needs proofing down."
1341,11,"Rich aroma of vanilla and corn crimped and spiced with oak. Authoritative strength full and solid; sharp oak and dry mint with vanilla and cornbread arriving toward the finish which is the only jarring note. There's too much woody bite at the close. Still very much a sipping whiskey; don't put anything but a bit of water or a single cube of ice in this. By far the best of the Total Wine store brands I've received. Sourced whiskey."
1342,8,"Floral and minty on the nose with dusty cedar chest and earth over red and yellow apple. The palate offers a decent concentration of flavors with citrus oil apricot and mouthwatering juiciness. It’s nicely layered and well-balanced but short on the finish. This whiskey has ranged widely over the years and as a single barrel selection your experience may vary."
1343,12,"The nose has berries in steel-cut oatmeal bracing vanilla bubble gum strawberry Fanta and yet also rugged earthiness: a picnic in a pine forest. On the palate the grain is evident but so too is drying oak orange cinnamon and chocolate. Water helps integrate the flavors and enhance the silky mouthfeel tying in Orange Crush cinnamon and espresso on the finish. At 2 years old this bourbon is youthful but balanced a well-constructed iteration of the four-grain (corn wheat rye malted barley) motif."
1344,8,"Oak-driven nose where dusty oak floorboard meets light brown sugar and some herbal notes. On the palate this delivers tropical fruits with hints of banana and papaya and features a nice slick mouthfeel that succumbs to drying tannins ending with nutty qualities and earthy forest floor. Simple and easy to enjoy."
1345,9,"These releases are all the same age but this one tastes the oldest and in a higher weight class. Deep and dark in personality. Chewy with some tobacco and roasted nuts thrown in the mix along with the toffee dark pit fruit oak spice and leather on the finish. Price is per 375 ml."
1346,11,"Good nose: fresh-ground corn warm oak and light cinnamon. Impressively friendly even at full proof: corn pudding sun-warmed oak plank rich and nuanced cinnamon spice a powerful engine running strong. A splash of water brings out some sweet berries revs up the oak and pulls out more spice and opens up the finish into a full-throated roar of oak corn and sweet citrus. This is what happens when you let a good barrel run at full throttle. Sourced whiskey. (Kentucky only)"
1347,9,"The second release in the new Taylor line by Buffalo Trace and the first single barrel offering. Similar in personality to the first release (a small batch offering) but a shade darker in color flavor and personality. A bit more intense too with more mouthfeel and not as demure. A fair trade-off. Starts off sweet (rummy burnt dark fruit fig cake) then becomes dry with dried spice tobacco toasted oak and leather. Very exciting and distinctive."
1348,9,"Rather bold (especially with the spice notes) with dark fruit (black raspberry jam plum) citrus glaze vibrant spice (vanilla cinnamon clove) a dusting of cocoa powder polished leather and pencil shavings all on a bed of caramel. Long spicy finish.  A nice way to finish a rich hearty meal perhaps?"
1349,9,"A marriage of four different bourbon recipes aged between 11 and 13 years. Very elegant and stylish as with many of the Four Roses offerings. Its age also shows with a firm measure of wood spice and grip on the nose and the latter half of the palate. Soft honey bright fruit (sultana ripe peach tangerine) and spice (cinnamon nutmeg crisp rye) evolving into darker fruit and more caramelized sugars on the palate along with leather notes on the finish."
1350,5,"Oh that rickhouse smell: charred oak leather vanilla and a slight hint of coconut. Then it’s caramel toasted walnuts pecans pine nuts and moon pie with hints of black licorice and cumin. Strong tobacco and ginger notes present themselves just before a delightful finish with hints of crème brûlée and vanilla custard. This is a regular sipper in my house."
1351,12,"A blend of straight bourbon and bourbons finished in red wine and sherry casks. Lovely grain aromas especially of porridge along with cinnamon clove baked apple citrus oil honey-roasted peanuts spearmint and milk chocolate. Nuttier grain on the palate which is led by red fruit caramel and lively spices: black pepper cinnamon allspice candied ginger. Citrus oil walnuts and a bit of cigar tobacco lead into a nutty somewhat light finish. The whiskey was distilled by Jim Beam master distiller Fred Noe and blended by Suntory master blender Shinji Fukuyo."
1352,8,"A nose of cherry candies rose water spiced molasses cookie candied nuts clove and nutmeg make a lovely first impression. On the palate it feels a bit soft with butter pecan ice cream banana and toffee as it strikes a balance of sweetness and spice. The finish veers toward earthiness with tobacco barn and warming chili spice."
1353,8,"Broad earthy undercurrents of cigar wrapper dark fertile soil and spice support the honeyed sweetness and vanilla of this big-screen bourbon. Overall the sweetness is well-tempered by cedar humidor tea leaf root beer spice and berry fruit combining seamlessly on the palate. Well-balanced and easy sipping. Best neat."
1354,12,"Cinnamon babka powdered donuts pecan-studded coffee cake: Call this breakfast whiskey. The nose is sweet light and nutty—a beignet with sugary chicory coffee. Sturdy and spiced on the palate it has flavors of cinnamon allspice pepper stone fruit cherry pie roasted pecans and bracing oak along with garden herbs. The finish is medium-length with milk chocolate black pepper and roasted nuts."
1355,12,"Grainy on the nose with butterscotch haystacks strawberry lollipop sugared pineapple mango dried kiwi and grape soda. Without water the palate is crowded with oak peppery heat and cocoa; add a bit however and there’s room for sweet plums and cherries grape jelly butterscotch and chai spices finishing with dry oak peanuts licorice and tobacco. Made with the distillery’s signature “Tennessee high malt” mashbill which includes corn malted rye and two types of malted barley."
1356,12,"The barrel dominates here by design and it manifests on the nose with fresh-cut oak cinnamon black tea leaves cashews blackcurrant dark chocolate and a sprinkling of spices. Savory and oak-forward on the chewy palate which has roasted nuts grilled corn dark chocolate peppermint stick dried chile black pepper espresso bean and tobacco leaf all sweeping into a lengthy chocolaty finish."
1357,12,"The nose is redolent of tea leaves peach skin herbal honey throat lozenges blueberries brown sugar licorice and toasted grain. More herbaceousness hits on the palate cooling some of the cinnamon spice of the high proof with spearmint and licorice notes; add water and nuttiness emerges. Continued herbal flavors into the finish which also has citrus oil and peppery spice. Strong barrel character throughout. (5500 bottles)"
1358,8,"Sweet notes of vanilla hazelnut and chocolate meet fragrant leathery oak on the nose along with chocolate mint and French burnt peanuts candy. On the palate this bourbon achieves a nice balance of stone fruit sweetness lively spice fresh spearmint and drying oak that strikes a sandalwood note. A splash of water makes it sing."
1359,12,"Aromas of cooked cherries and plums caramel cocoa powder tiramisu toasted tobacco leaves cut grass and pulled taffy create a heady first impression. In the mouth it’s silky and somewhat light with notes of peanut walnut shell cherry cough drops cinnamon black pepper and cigar wrapper. The finish is short and leathery with espresso cocoa powder and bitter almond."
1360,12,"A potpourri of herbs dried flowers licorice candied lemon peel baklava and furniture polish on the nose. The palate shows some minerality and is a bit bitter but has prominent blueberry grape and boysenberry flavors along with licorice coriander seed mint and oak spice. It finishes with dark fruit menthol licorice roasted nuts and plenty of oak. Takes water well."
1361,8,"A bit understated at first this offers simple candy sweetness and burnt marshmallow aromas along with citrus dried apple and cinnamon hearts candies that follow through on the palate with a hearty jolt of spice. The delicate wood and banana flavors followed by a finish of cocoa and warming ginger are well-crafted; however the flavors are inhibited by searing alcohol that feels out of sync for a whiskey of this proof and stature."
1362,12,"When the zombies come calling fortify yourself with this bourbon that ties in with the popular AMC show. Vanilla lemon curd and vinous fruit—overripe raspberries boysenberry syrup—on the nose along with candied rose petal and violet pastilles. The promise of sweetness is borne out by the palate which is floral and fruity with orange marmalade Juicy Fruit gum ginger-lemon cake rosewater nuts and dry oak. The finish has orange marmalade ginger cinnamon and chocolate."
1363,5,"5 years is when bourbon really starts developing complexity and you find the beginnings of greatness here with saltwater taffy vanilla custard citrus corn pudding and a healthy dose of cinnamon. Its proof offers satisfying warmth that quickly turns to spice. Medium finish gracefully gives a hint of warm vanilla icing. In an age of barrel strength bourbons this is a good one but lacks complexity for higher praise. Sourced whiskey."
1364,9,"A combination of 10 and 19 year old bourbons from two different recipes. Very spicy but no excessive oak (given the 19 year old component). Still there’s definitely more oak than last year’s release and maybe more than I would like for balance. Along with the cinnamon cool mint cocoa powder and nutmeg there are caramelized sugars and bright citrus notes. This is a tight whiskey -- not heavy and lethargic like some 10-plus year old bourbons can be. The flavors are crisp and vibrant all the way to its polished oak tobacco-tinged finish."
1365,5,"There’s a marriage here one of perfect harmony; fruit floral spice sweet and expressive toasted oak. Then the broad genres become specific: the fruit is cherries; the floral a hint of lavender; the sweet an array of toffee caramel and vanilla until its spice complexity kicks in showing allspice white pepper Spanish anise and nutmeg. Its proof never shows but the medium finish is just a touch short to make this truly special. (New Hampshire only)"
1366,9,"Finished 2 years in Quady Black Muscat barrels. Deep amber ruby hues. Richly sweet with raspberry preserve pipe tobacco dark chocolate prune honeysuckle vanilla and black tea. Dry leather finish cuts through the sweetness. Unique and peculiar. (Loch & K(e)y exclusive)"
1367,11,"A nose like Big Red gum—juicy-sweet cinnamon—and some sweet dough with sharp alcohol heat. Hot as expected on the tongue but exciting: more cinnamon and sweetness—like snickerdoodles—with wet corn a touch of bitter oil and hot spearmint. Adding water eases the heat and brings out the oak. Good stuff if a bit simple. Sourced whiskey."
1368,9,"A set of two 100% rye whiskeys triple distilled in copper pot stills with the difference between them being the type of barrels in which they were aged. One was matured in a new charred cask while the other one was aged in a used cask. They are packaged in half-bottle sizes (375 ml) and sold as a set for $100.
Very pale in color showing the limited oak influence. The used cask allows the rye to shine. An uncluttered whiskey with fresh mint soft cinnamon creamy vanilla hay cut grass and honeyed orchard fruit (green apple pear peach). Grassy finish. The more elegant of the two."
1369,9,"A lively bourbon with bright fruit honeyed vanilla and fragrant floral notes. Lean on the palate with a firm dry spicy finish. A youthful whiskey that skips along until the finish. It doesn’t have the thicker sweeter mid-palate like Barrel#87-6L reviewed here. As a result its finish is firm and crisply dry. (Bottled exclusively for The Party Source.)"
1370,5,"Lovely cinnamon candies offer an entrancing first taste with lemon drop and orange sherbet close behind. Baking spices come on strong mid-palate with undertones of caramel and vanilla. But what makes this special is its mouthfeel: tingly and warming the palate throughout. Cinnamon is ever-present."
1371,5,"Initially floral and fruit meet oak and a cadre of baking spices. Then it’s a plethora of vanilla in several forms from icing to pudding followed by notes of butterscotch fudge Oreo cookies and pecan shell. Sweet cigar tobacco and honey follow this home to a short to medium finish with a hint of peach cobbler. Ideal for cocktails."
1372,8,"This nose is all dry earthy oak tightly wrapped in rawhide but underneath lurks plenty of sweetness like overripe bananas with the slight bitterness of citrus oils or orange pekoe tea adding balance. Pleasing coffee and mocha flavors also emerge on the palate but the oak feels poorly integrated with a green-stick quality. Finished for 4 months in a custom grooved barrel. (42000 bottles)"
1373,5,"Sweet and smoke open this interesting whiskey that bounces from sweet to savory throughout. Vanilla and caramel meet burnt oak and charcoal smoke followed by cinnamon nutmeg and a lot of coffee. Hazelnut and salt water taffy jump in for a quick note just before a medium finish with a hint of smoke."
1374,8,"The initial herbal grainy and slightly grassy nose betrays some youth here but there is still a lot to like as roasted nuts floral aromas and nicely integrated toasty oak come to the rescue. A medium-bodied palate delivers lots of sweetness that smacks of honey and pureed pears remaining fresh and lively with gentle spice on the finish."
1375,2,"Lemon grove bananas and cream blackberry jam coconut flakes and brown sugar on the nose with black tea and a chalky mineral back note. The palate is soft and round with notes of whipped cream cooked blueberries gentle nuttiness peppermint and allspice. The finish is subtle in profile but has good length offering pleasant spice dark chocolate red berries and mellow oak. Balanced spice and lively fruit make for some pleasant sipping."
1376,9,"The third straight year of Birthday Bourbon releases. Last year we were blessed with not one but two practically flawless whiskeys (one quite richly flavored the other light and delicate). This 1995 vintage is nearly as good and reminds me in some ways of the first Birthday Bourbon release two years ago. Sweet notes of caramel maple cocoa powder and vanilla fudge (particularly on the front of the palate) are mingled with candied fruit and dry mint. The whiskey finishes fairly dry (more than its bouquet would suggest) with notes of polished leather mint dark chocolate and dried tea."
4197,6,"Matured in American oak and oloroso sherry casks. The nose is fragrant with honey vanilla ginger orange marmalade and a hint of smoke. Relatively full-bodied with flavors of tangy orange marzipan sherry bitter chocolate then oak. The finish is long with licorice and citrus fruit."
1377,2,"One of two single barrel bourbons distilled in 2015 this one selected by Firestone & Robertson co-founder Leonard Firestone. The nose is light and airy with notes of confectioners’ sugar orange peel peanuts coffee beans and semi-sweet chocolate. The palate offers rich chocolate bitter orange light tobacco and oak. The finish is barrel-forward with chocolate peanuts orange and spice. Too much barrel influence at times but the balance improves with water."
1378,8,"This light-hued bourbon is bright and airy with tropical fruit aromas of papaya and lychee vanilla and sweet lemon curd. While not especially bourbon-like it’s interesting and super-likeable for its Bit-O-Honey candy and pleasingly nutty notes. Last reviewed in 2011."
1379,9,"There’s no age statement but this wheated bourbon is about 10 years old. This is the softest and gentlest of the Antique Collection. Notes of molasses black raspberry jam ripe blueberry teaberry soft fig and cinnamon. Gently spicy clean finish. Could this whiskey be too easy to drink?"
1380,9,"I was concerned this whiskey would be woody and dry but it isn’t. (By comparison the 2009 “Mariage Collection” release a combination of 10 and 19 year old whiskeys comes across much more tannic and dry—especially on the finish.) The grain influence is less prominent (as might be expected) but it is replaced by some nicely dovetailed oak sugars and spices and forward fruit. It’s gentle on the nose and palate with creamy vanilla caramel custard apricot nectarine glazed citrus cherry pie and graham cracker spiked with subtle mint clove and cinnamon. Smooth soothing finish…therapeutic even. If you like your bourbons bold stimulating and challenging then this one isn’t for you. But if you want bourbon to comfort you like a warm blanket in cold weather then give this a try."
1381,2,"A very unusual nose for a bourbon with notes of cedar botanicals juniper bush pine forest and sweet mesquite wood. A zingy herbal palate offers dried orange peel and leather but also sweeter notes of chocolate-covered marshmallows black cherry almonds cotton candy and oak. The finish has excellent length ending with chocolate allspice espresso old leather and coffee ice cream. Deliciously chocolaty spicy and different."
1382,9,"Very creamy and gently sweet with a slightly oily texture. Notes of vanilla toasted coconut caramel tropical fruit honey-glazed almond cocoa and dusty corn. Well-balanced and soothing. A very easy-drinking whiskey. (Reviewer’s note: these are single barrel bottlings and they will vary from one barrel to the next.)"
1383,5,"At first it’s a smorgasbord of cotton candy vanilla caramel tapioca pudding honey and salted caramel. Then spice-bomb reality sets in with nutmeg cinnamon anise and ginger. Finally the spice gives way to caramel over cornbread malt and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. The medium finish ends what was developing into a great whiskey; alas much is to be desired."
1384,11,"Label: “BeanBall Bourbon – Tennessee Straight Bourbon Whiskey.” Believed to be from Dickel but no confirmation; just the huge cracked corn component in the nose which should be all you need. My that’s tasty as it spreads like warm oil over the tongue hot corn spirit spiked hard with oak. Good oak dried corn and a snap of mint in the finish. Nice selection…and interesting labeling in light of the recent Tennessee whiskey definition squabbles. Sourced whiskey."
1385,9,"A follow up to the original Jefferson’s Ocean 62 barrels of mature bourbon spent 5 months at sea. Can I detect any noticeable sea influence? Not really—perhaps a hint of brine—but it’s nice pleasant bourbon nonetheless with nothing out of place. Well rounded notes of layered sweetness (caramel vanilla maple syrup and a hit of sweet corn) honeyed orchard fruit and spiced with cinnamon and evergreen. Soft soothing finish. Sourced whiskey."
1386,12,"Cherry bubble gum white grape juice hazelnuts brown sugar and rye bread on the nose. The palate is bright and gently spiced with a soft creamy texture and restrained grape black tea nut and chocolate flavors. Coffee beans nutty chocolate and persistent oak on the finish. Surprisingly austere for a wine cask-finished bourbon but to good effect."
1387,2,"A fragrant mellow nose of vanilla cream and root beer with hints of lime wood char and oak. The palate offers racy red fruit berry skins desert herbs chocolate licorice and oak tannins with a minty peppery note. The finish presents a new round of dry oak peanuts rich chocolate cracked pepper cedar and red fruit. The tequila-barrel finishing creates an almost rye-like spiciness in this unusual creative offering. (900 bottles)"
1388,12,"Herbal citrus and subtle oak aromas mingle with grape soda ground ginger iced tea and cinnamon Teddy Grahams on the nose. Medium-bodied and well-spiced it’s a little hot but softens with water and develops nicely in the glass showing flavors of chocolate nuts grape jelly and blueberry compote. The finish is sweet with cooked berries chocolate oak and subtle spice. Made by Valentine Distilling Co. in Ferndale Michigan."
1389,8,"Certainly one for the oak lover the nose is dominated by fresh lumber dusty floorboard and toasty wood notes with sweet vanilla hazelnut cedar and dark berry buried beneath. The palate is similarly oak-driven with grape skins tea leaves and robust wood tannins leading to a finish that is dry and somewhat austere with bitter chocolate and modest spice flavors."
1390,12,"Delicate and dessert-like on the nose: pistachio and vanilla rice pudding milk chocolate cherry pie filling grape soda honey-roasted peanuts and iced tea. Naturally it’s very sweet and almost syrupy at times with powdered sugar orange cherry rose water milk chocolate and cinnamon; the mouthfeel is silky bordering on light. It finishes simply with milk chocolate candied nuts and vanilla."
1391,12,"Aromatic and expressive on the nose with grapefruit lemon and orange peels kiwi green apple Hi-Chew melon and a hint of pine and dried leaves. The palate is light-bodied and clean with citrus peel melon soft spice sarsaparilla and milk chocolate. It finishes short and gentle but tasty with candied rose petal dried kiwi and grape Fun Dip. While many beer-barrel finishes come on too strong this one succeeds with subtlety."
1392,8,"Despite some obvious youth the aromas here are enjoyable as Honey Nut Cheerios and bake shop sticky buns and cinnamon rolls hearken to the primary grain flavors. Fruity banana Raisinets and lots of fresh oak are apparent. Marmalade and citrus oil flavors are tasty but the gingerbread heat and raw oak suggest it would benefit from additional maturation."
1393,2,"From Washington D.C.-based distiller Republic Restoratives this is an Indiana-made bourbon aged 5 years and then finished in armagnac casks for about 8 weeks. The nose offers light notes of dried figs and fragrant herbs as well as a distinct back note of earthiness. Nutty oily and somewhat dry on the palate with spice and restraining oak tannins leading to a finish that’s also dry but with flavors of vanilla and light nuttiness. (14000 bottles)"
1394,12,"The nose is light sweet and mildly chalky like talcum powder or freshly whipped meringue; it also has pistachio pudding and hints of flavored tobacco. On the palate embers burn gently beneath apple almond and milk chocolate with a pleasantly silky mouthfeel. The medium-length finish rounds things out with smoked vanilla sugar dark-roast coffee and bittersweet oak. This has plenty of personality but a light touch."
1395,9,"Ripe fruit (peach apricot golden raisin) on the front of the palate followed by layered sweet notes of caramel butterscotch and toffee finishing with oak dried vanilla and a hint of cinnamon. Great mouthfeel. Each barrel is unique in flavor profile. There’s no barrel number identified on the label so the one you buy may vary slightly. Having said this the barrel I reviewed was very enjoyable."
1396,12,"This is more about mashbill than barrel a fine showcase of grain. Light and sweet on the nose with peanuts nougat creamed corn banana pudding coconut cake and Popsicle stick; water brings out fresh apple. It stays consistent on the palate showcasing the purity and sweetness of the grain: cream vanilla taffy toasted coconut and toasted wood. It finishes with peanuts toasted coconut clean grain and oak."
1397,12,"Like opening a lunchbox in elementary school: you’ll find the distinct aromas of peanut butter sandwich with strawberry jam and a smear of Marshmallow Fluff plus a Little Debbie Oatmeal Cream Pie and some apple blossom and tea rose. Soft and sweet in the mouth with plenty of fruit and flowers: banana split topped with crushed pistachios rose oil white chocolate halva. This whiskey is finished in charred maple barrels and undergoes a second filtration with the Lincoln County Process."
1398,5,"Starting with floral fruit and perfume notes its prominent bouquet barely allows the undertones of honeysuckle spice and oak to shine through. On the palate honey canned peaches tobacco and crème brûlée lead the way just before an explosion of vanilla layers the palate in the form of cake batter icing and a white fudge-dipped Oreo. However bitterness sets in causing a slight unbalance and lingers toward the medium finish."
1399,5,"No two Angels Envy Cask Strengths offer the same aromas. Here cotton candy honey roasted pecan and chocolate malt. Then a strange turn on the palate; roasted corn dark chocolate honey syrup mashed cherry caramel Scotch ale and cinnamon. Smoked cherrywood hickory milk chocolate strawberry preserves orange peel and peach cobbler. What were once multiple fruit flavors now become a single cherry turnover with a sprinkle of cinnamon. It finishes medium with cherry."
1400,5,"Confectionary goodies all around. Vanilla caramel with milk and chocolates: dark Mexican sweet and white. Lots of chocolate. It’s soft and gentle with zero spice only rich chocolate and caramel with hints of grain and fruit but this richness cannot be overstated. If you love chocolate and caramel this is your dream bourbon. It finishes long and strong with a hint of—you guessed it—chocolate. Price is per 375ml"
1401,5,"Slow-roasted corn marzipan cinnamon nutmeg and kettle corn start this experience and slowly fade to corn on the cob with butter salt and pepper. Then it’s apple cider vinegar deep-fried mushrooms and Nutella. Fried pie dough and hints of chocolate appear before a medium finish that has a hint of toffee."
1402,11,"Less driving aroma than Batch 005; lower floor? Both are a mashbill of 70/26/4% corn/rye/malt. More corn and cinnamon and bread dough in the nose here. A lot like 005 but more sweet cornmeal less spice less height in the mouth and the finish is sweeter and longer. Might be that farmer’s younger brother; this one’s only 8 years old. Still good a bit less complex. Sourced whiskey."
1403,9,"Aged over 6 years this is a rather feminine version of Booker’s. It’s sweet relatively gentle compared to previous releases and quite fragrant (bordering on perfumed—especially on the nose). Creamy vanilla coats the palate with suggestions of coconut macaroon and marzipan. Dried spice (cinnamon mint) and drying oak on the finish keep the sweetness in check."
1404,11,"Fresh-shucked sweet corn on the nose a wisp of hot clove spice some fresh grassiness; a clean aroma. True on the palate with a bit of fresh cob as well and firm oak. Lean and a bit leathery in the Woodford style but lighter in the mouth; is the lightness from the white corn? I like this; I tend to give Woodford a bit more latitude in these essays."
1405,9,"An accidental “mingling” of rye whiskey with bourbon resulting in a product that acts like bourbon with an unusually high percentage of rye in the mashbill. It shows with vibrant notes of warming cinnamon fresh mint nutmeg licorice root and a hint of tellicherry pepper. All this is soothed by vanilla caramel and subtle honeyed citrus. Lively distinctive and versatile."
1406,12,"A light and sweet bourbon with butterscotch candy toasted coconut lemon curd marshmallow and a bit of chalkiness on the nose. The palate is floral tending toward cedar and sandalwood perfume with marzipan milk chocolate and orange. It finishes with hookah tobacco toasted oak and almonds."
1407,8,"A solid basic bourbon with pure sweetness honey marzipan and wildflower notes. The sweet drive is nicely backed with drying oak on the pronounced finish like sucking on a sweet and woody cherry Popsicle stick. A simple and enjoyable crowd pleaser and smaller sibling to the Barrel Proof our 2017 Whisky of the Year."
1408,8,"The dried fruit almost like Fruit Roll-Ups quickly veers toward circus peanuts candy taffy and bubble gum with notes of herbs— especially dill. The palate remains a bit of a fruit bomb with banana peach puree dried papaya and other tropical fruits then clove and allspice add some complexity. A flavorful if slightly peculiar bourbon dominated by tutti-frutti flavors and dill."
1409,8,"Redolent of marshmallow and vanilla this is restrained on the nose but revels in pretty sweetness with peaches and cream ripe banana and circus peanuts candies. On the palate this collaboration with actor Matthew McConaughey betrays some of its Wild Turkey pedigree capturing the house earthiness. For its modest proof it pours a bit hot on the palate with plenty of oak tannins making it a nice sipper on the rocks or with water. Value pick"
1410,12,"The nose is loaded with jasmine orange blossoms fresh peaches gummy bears red wine grape fruit leather and lashings of vanilla. In the mouth it’s a mixed berry bonanza—raspberry blueberry and strawberry—with cherry Red Vines chocolate and a hint of tobacco leaf. Though light with a somewhat short finish it’s well-balanced and tasty."
1411,12,"This undergoes secondary maturation in heavily toasted and smoked new charred oak barrels but you wouldn’t know it from the delicate nose redolent with white flowers Asian pear cardamom toasted almonds and milk chocolate; the only hint is a bit of burnt sugar and dry leaves. On the palate those special barrels reveal themselves with flavors of cedar black pepper chipotle and barbecue potato chips as well as apple pecan and milk chocolate. The finish has chili-chocolate and long polished oak."
1412,12,"Unbaked pastry dough swirled with brown sugar and chopped almonds meets orange blossom water cream soda coconut flakes and pistachio pudding. There’s more pastry toasted coconut and almonds cinnamon brown sugar and orange on the palate along with plenty of oak. A splash of water goes a long way to emphasize the prettier flavors while playing down some of the youthful heat."
1413,12,"Fruity and fresh there are aromas of Juicy Fruit gum honeydew underripe bananas and floral notes—a garden in bloom. The palate retains freshness with herbaceous flavors of parsley and cucumber as well as melon licorice white pepper and a pop of cumin. Oak pepper licorice and bouquet garni on the finish. Unconventional but enjoyable flavors driven by the still."
1414,2,"Fresh oak on the nose floral notes baked apple bananas and chocolate malt. The palate is light and slightly green with herbal parsley notes lime and lemon then expanding to vanilla bitter chocolate peanut shells pepper and tobacco. The finish is chocolaty with more notes of peanut as well as orange peel herbaceousness and peppery heat."
1415,11,"After regular bourbon maturation this is finished in a barrel made from toasted wood with no charring (and no age statement). The wood character of the nose is restrained; corn vanilla some nuts and light citrus but just a light hint of oak spice. Complex mouth: corn pudding cornmeal sugar cookies caramel pawpaw jackfruit and a real creaminess that stretches into the finish…where we get the delayed oak. Mature whiskey smooth young whiskey lively and a good price too. Sourced whiskey."
1416,12,"A blend of straight bourbons and American whiskeys all aged at least 4 years this is fruit cocktail in a glass: cherries blackberries wild strawberries and sweet orange along with allspice clove nutmeg and a hint of cedar. Sweet viscous and full in the mouth with more fruit (cooked cherry orange peel peach) spices and plenty of oak all the way to the finish."
1417,9,"Soft elegant and nicely rounded with honeyed orchard fruit and gentle spice on a bed of vanilla and caramel. Very versatile; a pleasing unchallenging bourbon to suit most moods and situations. I actually like it better than the new older 10 year old expression (reviewed in this issue) because it is so beautifully balanced."
1418,9,"The oak staves are placed in a “hot box” at 133 degrees and then steamed before being built up into a barrel. Aged over 16 years this is pleasant whiskey (if not overly complex) with caramel tropical fruit marzipan a hint of toasted coconut and a nice creamy texture. My favorite of the two experimental releases. Price is per 375ml."
1419,12,"Pineapple rings lemon and orange wedges and brown sugar aromas offset fresh pine and a bundle of herbs: basil tarragon fennel. The chewy palate is herbal and savory with licorice dark chocolate roasted cherry and plenty of oak yielding to pineapple orange and lemon on the finish. The bump-up in proof from its non-bonded sibling bourbon yields nice results when adding water which softens and expands the flavors."
1420,9,"Triple distilled. (Twice in Kentucky once in Virginia.) Gritty and gripping on the palate showing dry vibrant oak spice (particularly warming cinnamon and mouth-coating vanilla) but with candied fruit toffee pot still rum and caramel-coated nuts to keep it interesting. Polished leather and tobacco on the finish. (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.)"
1421,8,"The oak juts out a bit in this otherwise fresh and pleasant bourbon where toasted oak meets cake batter Honey Nut Cheerios and porridge with pecans. It’s lacking much in the way of a ‘wow factor’ but following the slightly tart fruit palate is a redeeming finish balancing tasty apricot and bright citrus peel with drying oak tannins."
1422,12,"The nose is dark and roasty: clay dried leaves walnut and pecan shells cacao nibs dried chiles tobacco leaf and darjeeling tea as well as hints of tropical fruit. Full-bodied and oak-driven on the palate with spiced tea-leaf complexity highlighted by tobacco leaf cinnamon clove allspice black pepper mint oil chocolate and roasted corn. Continued chocolate oak and spice into the finish interwoven with cigar wrapper and pops of licorice and mint."
1423,2,"Licorice black tea lemon green apple pomegranate and almond on the nose. The palate is fruity smooth and light up front with notes of dried orange slices orange Creamsicle lemon curd and accents of nuttiness. The finish offers more orange as well as flavors of vanilla cream and sweet raspberry all spiced with an overlay of white pepper. Wispy and lacking deep complexity but with balanced sweetness and some very pleasant notes."
1424,12,"The nose starts with anise cookies and butterscotch then reveals magnolia leaf bergamot sarsaparilla and tea leaves. Barrel-driven the palate is peppery minty and a little piney with bitter chocolate and roasted nuts. More black pepper chocolate peppermint stick and bitter oak into the short finish. Water recommended. (278 bottles)"
1425,12,"Fresh green and earthy: bell pepper jalapeño unshucked corn and lime leaf as well as cacao nibs cedar cigar box and cinnamon. More peppers on the palate this time dried and smoked along with roasted pecans chocolate nuts bitter oak and a hint of tobacco. The finish is short and light; a little more proof would go a long way."
1426,12,"Bright with lemon and lime as well as gardenias and peonies—a fresh garden on the nose; there’s also uncooked corn on the cob mint toothpaste tea leaf and pecan shell. The palate is spiced and oak-forward countered by grape jelly dark chocolate coffee bean and hints of tobacco. It’s occasionally jumbled even into the finish which has roasted pecans pipe tobacco leather and black pepper."
1427,12,"There are nostalgic bubble gum notes on the nose—Bazooka and Big League Chew—as well as orange sherbet strawberry shortcake cherry pie snickerdoodles and milk chocolate. Sweet and fruit-forward on the palate with grape jelly cherry preserves chocolate cinnamon clove and a hint of rose water. It finishes a bit short and soft rolling out spiced oak and a bouquet of candied violets. (700 bottles)"
1428,9,"This new Jack Daniel’s offering is marketed as being “bold and smooth.” It certainly is bolder when compared to the standard Jack Daniel’s offering with a mélange of corn creamy vanilla toasted caramel bright citrus and dry resinous oak spiked with cinnamon. The smoothness ends however when the oak grip intensifies on the finish. Adding ice does tame the oak if that’s your thing. Still I’d prefer the oak be more restrained. Price is per liter."
1429,2,"A nose of peanut oil roasted pecans dried figs crushed herbs dark fruit and a light note of dunnage house floor. The palate is layered with flavors of allspice dark fruit bitter orange dark chocolate and cherry balanced against drying oak and a light hint of musty attic. The finish dials up notes of fresh blueberry pie honeyed nuts peanut butter cookies sweet red fruits pancake syrup and wood spice."
4645,9,"Amber chestnut color. Aromas are rich and express great depth with highlights of ripe fruit and wood spices. Well-rounded flavors are balanced very nicely with a gentle sweetness up front that marries well with ripe fruit becoming dry with background wood spice notes."
1430,5,"From the folks at Willett distillery Noah’s Mill has less than 20 barrels in a batch and will include 15 year old barrels in the dump. The deep amber color prepares the nose for what promises to be an exciting ride. Aromas of ginger plums cinnamon fresh-baked cornbread and fresh-squeezed cherries. The warm palate packs caramel nutmeg and vanilla with lovely cinnamon on the finish. Sourced whiskey."
1431,11,"Sweet reek of the warehouse; sugary bourbon drooling and drying on oak staves the richly boozy air dusty wood. It’s all here like Bardstown in a bottle. Enters with authority a hot rush of corn solidly oak-edged sizzling with allspice and cinnamon and backed with a solid strop of leather. Then the sun comes up: a sweet glowing finish. Beautifully bridges the gap between young and old bourbon and an absolute steal at the price."
1432,9,"A blend of two different bourbons—one 6 years old the other 10 years old—with different mashbills. Nicely balanced sweet notes (caramel butterscotch) fruit (orange sultana cherry) and gentle spice (vanilla cinnamon). Nothing fancy or exotic here; just a solid versatile well-rounded bourbon. (Available at the High West General Store.)"
1433,8,"The nose on this is lovely and seductive with a gingerbread cookie quality coupled with leather and baking spices. The palate is lively and warming with root beer spices but its character is overshadowed by the intensity of the toasted barrel and feels just a bit hollow beneath all that lavish oak."
1434,5,"Quite an unusual start: melted butter poured over brown rice followed by caramel vanilla and fried sweet potatoes. Although the ABV suggests it’s light the body actually holds up quite well with notes of banana quince marzipan bread pudding and vanilla. Alas the short finish doesn’t follow suit only offering a hint of caramel."
1435,12,"Candy apple and artificial fruit notes like Kool-Aid powder dominate the nose which overall is fairly reticent. Semi-sweet chocolate peanuts orange oil apple peels white pepper and cinnamon as well as plenty of oak on the simple palate. The finish is peppery with plenty of oak and pops of orange. A few drops of water help this whiskey hang together."
1436,5,"It begins with notes of brown sugar Nutter Butter hazelnut nutmeg and vanilla with hints of roasted nuts. They’re pronounced and rounded with secondary and tertiary notes introducing malt cornbread and salt water taffy. The medium finish offers a hint of bacon bits."
1437,12,"A sweet and fragrant nose with orange blossom confectioners’ sugar coconut vanilla almond nougat and a hint of tart green papaya. Sweetness is borne out by the palate’s milk chocolate and nougat studded with orange peel as well as vanilla pudding brown sugar raw pecans and a hint of white pepper. More milk chocolate and vanilla on the short finish. Some winning qualities though overall this whiskey feels a bit rushed."
1438,5,"Think corn: roasted canned creamed mashed pan-fried in salsa and in bread. The corn pops early and often. This complements hazelnut caramel pudding and baking spices. A drop of water really opens this up softening the corn-heavy notes and bringing forth fruits and spices. Even the finish is better with water. Perhaps this whiskey was meant to have a lower proof."
1439,12,"The nose is nutty sweet with marmalade on toast and caramel apple and spiced like gingerbread sprinkled with dried cherries and Craisins. The palate is hotter than expected at this proof tannic with oak and spiced with cinnamon candy dried ginger and red pepper; spearmint emerges with water. More cinnamon chocolate coffee bean and sweet oak on the finish. This updated blend of the Fusion series has a rougher character than previous iterations."
1440,13,"Comprised of 60% corn 20% wheat 11% malted barley and 9% rye this whiskey has hay fresh apricot wood shavings and vanilla sugar on the nose. With water lemon and fresh berries atop pancakes emerge. The silky palate trends toward sweet though with plenty of oak gentle spice roasted almonds and Hershey’s chocolate. The spice turns zestier with a spray of citrus oil when water is added. The finish overlays generous tobacco on oak."
1441,12,"An unconventional mix of aromas: pistachios in the shell jasmine tea banana peel butterscotch and furniture polish. Robust oak tussles with grain-forward distillate on the palate supported by spice roasted nuts cacao nibs and peppermint stick; water brings out burnt marshmallow and cinnamon stick. It finishes on a peppery and peppermint note dotted with cacao peppery spice and charred oak."
1442,5,"Straw color and extremely light in aromatics this whiskey starts earthy and goes spicy with Hatch chili allspice and jalapeño cornbread leading the way. Then the sweeter side kicks in with powdered sugar donuts caramel chew and vanilla latte coming through. Spice takes over toward the finish line in a hefty medium finish. Perfect for cocktails. Price is per 375 ml."
1443,11,"Hot wet oak berries Red Hots and wet cornmeal. Closer to the nose it’s sharper and woodier. Lots of wood on the entry but sweet corn and cloved hard candy too with heat from the 100 proof that lingers through the oaky finish. At 7 years this is extra-spicy and a touch of water tames the heat and the oak. Bowman’s still finding its way but the path seems right."
1444,2,"Initially the nose is herbal with emerging notes of new oak baked apple sassafras spice and old leather. The palate is earthy and herbal with pulling oak tannins while water smooths out the heat and coaxes out more spice. The finish offers some classic bourbon notes but is somewhat lacking in balance. There are some youthful notes in the blend that don’t seem to offer much depth and complexity. (12000 bottles)"
1445,2,"The nose is a medley of bananas and cream cinnamon-covered apples and saltwater taffy with an undernote of new wood. A rich creamy palate offers dried orange slices marmalade dried figs mince pie and vanilla cream. The finish has notes of baking spice vanilla more dried fruit and a peppery back note. Delightfully sweet and with good texture following through nicely on the finish. Youthful but balanced and enjoyable."
1446,12,"A rather innocuous bourbon it shows some of the pep that its namesake racehorse surely shares with aromas of banana pudding banana peel lemon vanilla cloves licorice cherry hard candy and cornbread. There’s zingy lemon and orange rose oil vanilla cherry and some herbal flavors on the palate with more banana peel candied fruit and lemon oil on the finish."
1447,12,"Made at Oregon’s Cascade Street Distillery and purporting to be “mountain-style” bourbon this whiskey presents a mix of herbal and fruity aromas to start along with baking spice brown sugar and vanilla frosting. The palate is light-bodied but rich in oak roasted nut dried chili cocoa powder and cigar with dried flower notes when water is added; plenty of oak and dark chocolate on the finish."
1467,12,"Vivacious and fresh aromas of raspberry licorice cookies brown sugar herbal tea and toasted oak. The palate falls a little short of the setup with a light body and some youthful heat driven by oak. Nevertheless orange and lemon peels roasted pecans caramel blackberry nutmeg and black pepper punch through the wood demonstrating a well-executed if simple bourbon."
1448,2,"Dried orange and apricot cherry hard candy and vanilla frosting on the nose along with cantaloupe peanut butter and grainy notes of seed corn. The palate is light spiced and oak-driven with more corn peanuts chocolate sauce and orange oil plus vanilla iced tea citrus oil lemon spice and chili pepper. The finish offers more heft but is light though with some interesting elements on offer."
1449,2,"The nose is dry and chalky with notes of dried leaves dried cherries and raspberries. The palate is also dry with some peppery spice. Water unlocks chocolate and the dryness recedes a bit. The finish is the best part offering orange Creamsicle and vanilla notes though still dry. Water brings out light tobacco leaf. Unusually dry and somewhat ashy with some appealing notes that never quite emerge."
1450,9,"Distilled in 2001 this year’s release is a departure from recent releases which were complex and nicely balanced. It’s more aggressive with tannins and oak dominating and lacking the body and sweetness to balance it. It’s my least favorite of this year’s offerings. Dark chocolate toffee tobacco and dried fruit round out the palate and offer some comfort. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2016"
1451,8,"An easy drinker with typical caramel and vanilla notes tinged with herbal flavors of horehound and pine boughs. Nicely balances bright fruit and sweetness with generous rye spice suggesting an oatmeal cookie with vanilla frosting. While not overly complex flavors are nicely integrated with charred oak. (5000 bottles)"
1452,2,"A new brand honoring golf legend Bobby Jones and offering three expressions—a rye a 10 year old Tennessee whiskey and this single-barrel bourbon. The bourbon has a nose of mint red berries blueberries orange slices and pine forest. The palate is smoothly textured and full bodied with generous notes of vanilla spice cedar and pepper. The finish is somewhat oak-heavy but with good texture and pleasant fruit notes. Solid and well balanced. (24000 bottles)"
1453,12,"An aromatic nose reveals chamomile tea dried herbs peanut shells fresh sawdust snickerdoodles brown sugar and stone fruit. The palate is simple but pleasing with black tea licorice bitter nuts dry oak and a touch of cinnamon. It finishes fairly short with pleasant flavors of eucalyptus black pepper and oak."
1454,2,"Pinhook’s first bourbon distilled at Castle & Key Distillery following an earlier release of a rye. The palate is smooth despite the high proof with tart notes of orange peel. Water smooths it out with some pepper and spice emerging against restraining oak tannins. Aged 2 years and 10 months it has a young and dry profile but some pleasant spice and earthy notes on offer."
1455,2,"A pleasant nose of spicy perfumed oak that’s also lightly floral and melds well with notes of coriander and dill pistachio pudding and hints of earthiness and minerality. The palate has plenty of spice and heat with youthful notes of papaya cinnamon salt water taffy bitter chocolate and young oak. Water unlocks more pronounced cinnamon and a light nuttiness improving upon a somewhat youthful finish."
1456,5,"Cotton candy caramel baked apples roasted pecans freshly baked rye rolls and herbs start a truly approachable pour. Its story opens in a spice race: cinnamon nutmeg turmeric and smoked paprika and a slight hint of coffee. A burst of dill hits just before vanilla walks it home to a lovely medium finish. An interesting sipper but remarkable in cocktails."
1457,5,"Cornbread and toffee start this alluring whiskey followed by hints of paprika fruits flowers and caramel. Afterward it opens up into a bakery with cinnamon rolls caramel chews vanilla cupcakes and ginger. Baking spices and earth appear over a medium finish that offers black licorice. It’s well-suited for mixing."
1458,5,"This blend of 6 to 8 year old bourbon is finished for 3 to 4 months in casks that aged Cognac for 12 years. There’s fruit especially dried apricot pear passion fruit grapefruit and cherry. Then caramel oak leather tobacco vanilla and a slight hint of cinnamon. Honestly there’s a textural brandy-and-bourbon struggle but beautiful vanilla and nutmeg surface ensuring it is indeed bourbon. A muted spice comes toward the end with rich caramel. Solid sipper."
1459,5,"A batch of OESO 12 year old OBSV 12 year old and OESK 16 year old. Normally Four Roses expresses a near-patented cinnamon note up front with fruity undertones. Not this time. Earth oak powerfully rich caramel nutmeg vanilla barrel char with slight hints of grain corn syrup and cardamom. Finally the quintessential cinnamon shows over a slightly disappointing medium finish."
1460,5,"This is unique in that it seems to be malt-forward specifically floor malt with oak and cinnamon following. But caramel enters the dance and does so in a big way. Nuances of crème brûlée caramel popcorn maple syrup and caramelized corn with hints of cola raspberry and apple tart. While the flavor is here the finish is just a touch short to put this in elite company. Nonetheless it’s a decent sipper."
1461,9,"The port finish is very evident but not overpowering. A fruit basket on the palate with caramel apple currants (red and black) bramble apricot toasted coconut vanilla wafer and anise. Rich and velvety in texture with a long gently sweet finish."
1462,11,"Smells like bourbon—corn a bit of cinnamon oak—but there’s something else: a touch of doughy sweetness a note of straight wood a twist. Light and pleasant with enough heat to keep it respectable (and likely alive in a cocktail); all the usual suspects are here but without the heavier oak character. Afternoon bourbon."
1463,11,"Full oaky nose with the brash power of youth. Zingy and bright with corn sweet and hot mint chunky oak and a warm spicy-sweet finish. On the front edge of the bell curve for 4 to 6 year old bourbons; plenty of spunk. Not for someone who wants a mellow glass this one's lively. Sourced whiskey."
1464,12,"Oak-forward from start to finish with aromas of new wood fresh and dried flowers oranges candy apple cherry soda and iced tea. Wood fresh apple semi-dark chocolate orange iced tea chamomile and a sweep of spices roll into a cinnamon clove and chocolate finish that remains oak-dominated."
1465,2,"Aromas of orange roasted pineapple lime pine nuts cinnamon and leather on the nose with a cherry-strawberry note. Light refined cherry on the palate with roasted walnuts dark chocolate and light char. Water unlocks bright cherry and chocolate fudge with notes of char and roasted coffee beans. A nutty fruity finish carries on the red berry note along with a swirl of vanilla and chocolate. A deft balance of fruit sweetness and spice."
1466,12,"Buttery nutty and richly spiced this has all the hallmarks of a sherry-finished whiskey—dried fruit hazelnuts chocolate—but retains its bourbon core with strong peanut concord grape jelly and roasted corn aromas. On the palate it’s bourbon first: peanuts cooked cherries and plenty of oak. But the sherry softens and rounds out the mouthfeel adding gentle spice dried fruit and silkiness."
1468,12,"The nose is sweet and wood-driven with butterscotch molasses cookies toasted pecans and a faint floral note. Cinnamon chili pepper almonds orange and candied violets buoy a somewhat thin mouthfeel all rounded off with sweet floral flavors and subtle oak. Six month old Kentucky bourbon that has been “finished” in stainless steel tanks with French and American oak and oloroso  sherry staves."
1469,12,"Grain-forward on the nose with raw peanuts milk chocolate orange pekoe tea grape Pixy Stix and cinnamon Teddy Grahams. Without water the palate is chewy oaky and grain-heavy; with water there’s a delicious Cocoa Krispies flavor as well as walnuts and cinnamon oatmeal. Nutty chocolate and oak on the finish."
1470,9,"Drier on the palate than the 90 with more caramel than honey and more oak spice (especially vanilla) and grip on the finish. Still rather light in personality. However I’m looking for more sweet notes to partner with the dried spice. Price is per 375 ml."
1471,13,"An unusual cask finish for bourbon; the rosé imparts floral and fruity notes on the nose with dried orange peel fragrant oak cotton candy bubble gum and Jolly Rancher. The palate is surprisingly zippy with citrus cinnamon and oak but loses full harmony among its disparate flavors. On the finish there’s more cinnamon along with chicory and oak. The overall journey is a bit uneven. (2400 bottles)"
1472,5,"Some bourbons are balanced or complex; this is an all-around versatile pour with initial notes of lightly toasted oak brown sugar and butterscotch. A fun maltiness concentrated caramel and slight hints of cinnamon and watermelon Juicy Fruit hammer home its sipping potential but its short to medium finish suggests that it’s more suited for cocktails. But hey why not both?"
1473,5,"Caramel and cigar box lead the way but leather comes in strong followed by oak earth and mushrooms. On the palate Nutella and roasted almonds resonate over crème brûlée salt water taffy vanilla icing and nutmeg with slight hints of apple and pineapple at which point I think it really starts to pick up and take on some complexity. Alas the short finish hurts what was a delightful experience."
1474,5,"Cotton candy campfire smoke cinnamon pilsner beer butterscotch and vanilla start a whiskey conversation that’s about balance easy sipping and the pursuit of spice. Around mid-palate a plethora of baking spices—clove nutmeg vanilla cinnamon and allspice—charms the senses. It’s set up to be a great run but the approach softens toward the finish with muted brown sugar appearing. Still the flavor and balance make for a fun sipper and great cocktail mixer."
1475,9,"Sourced from several undisclosed Kentucky bourbon distillers. Well-rounded and nicely balanced with prominent spice (cinnamon clove evergreen powdered vanilla) soft fruit (mandarin coconut apricot hint of pineapple) and toasted nuts all on a bed of caramel. Very versatile: mature enough for pleasurable sipping (but just) and youthful enough to add zing to a cocktail."
1476,12,"Grainy and floral on the nose with aromas of bananas Foster pine resin cardamom lemon iced tea tart blackberries and nougat. Kicky black pepper and cinnamon smooth out with a touch of water yielding banana Popsicle lemon bars roasted pistachios and cigar wrapper. A short finish with toasted oak pecans and nougat."
1477,12,"Vibrantly fruity with strawberry and orange Creamsicle on the nose along with clean hay toasted oak cinnamon caramel and bay leaf. Wood spices on the front palate give way to orange custard pomegranate caramel and cinnamon bread notes with a pop of chili-dusted roasted corn lashed with bitter oak on the finish."
1478,8,"Fairly light in flavor with warm cereal and honey notes laced with aromas of green herbs chamomile and spearmint. Seems well-crafted but the flavors are generally understated offering gentle sweetness and fleeting glimmers of baking spice. Modest body and a touch hot on the finish."
1479,9,"A thick heavyweight bourbon. Older doesn’t always taste older and this 30 year old Jefferson’s tastes younger than its sibling 25 year old. The influence of 30 years in oak is evident with its polished leather tobacco and charred oak. However there’s a surprising sweetness that props up the oak with maple syrup blackberry jam cinnamon roll and vanilla cream. Very even-keeled. Yes it tastes old but with redeeming qualities. Dark and mysterious in personality."
1480,12,"Peanut brittle on wax paper corn pudding orange slices grape Nerds cotton candy and kettle corn on the nose. The palate has plenty of oak Corn Nuts peanuts tea leaf apple white pepper and Fruit Stripe gum though it begs for more proof. It finishes fairly quickly with vanilla and oak. (7000 bottles)"
1481,12,"Fruit-forward on the nose with apples blueberries cinnamon coffee ice cream and chocolate-caramel milkshake. It’s silky and light-bodied in the mouth with a heaping slab of dry oak peanut shells walnuts pepper cacao nibs and orange peel. The oak persists on the finish which is a bit abrupt."
1482,8,"A host of sweet confections—caramel corn candied apples toasted marshmallow bubble gum and gobs of banana taffy—are reminiscent of a warm summer night at the fair. The palate speaks of orchard fruits sweet golden apples and poached pear as hints of peach and cocoa appear on the clean enjoyable and succinct finish."
1483,12,"Cinnamon Red Hots peanut shells almonds burnt sugar pencil shavings and fresh ears of corn on the nose. There’s more cinnamon on the palate as well as milk chocolate Goobers orange oil a pretty floral character and plenty of chewy oak; a few drops of water straighten up the balance. The finish is all about the oak and cinnamon warming and sweet. (2100 bottles)"
1484,5,"An 8 year old Kentucky straight bourbon finished in Oregon oak that apparently brings about vanilla cake batter caramel hints of coffee and citrus. Soft and delicate to the taste with exploding French toast notes cinnamon allspice and a hint of blueberry jam. The finish comes and goes but leaves an impressive watermelon Jolly Rancher-cinnamon combo at the end. This one is meant to be sipped without the addition of water or ice. Sourced whiskey."
1485,11,"Interesting that the label says “Artfully Aged” yet there’s no actual age statement. Lively nose good rye snap and spice a bit of mint and oaky edge. Not hot well-behaved on the tongue and happily gives back everything taken on the nose. Sweet spicy and easy to like this is whiskey without flaw well-done and tasty if not overly ambitious or challenging."
1486,9,"A pleasing very drinkable bourbon. Elegant notes of butterscotch candy honey-tinged fruit creamy vanilla and sweet corn with delicate mint on the finish. A versatile bourbon that fits most moods and occasions. (Bottled exclusively for Bayway World of Liquor.)"
1487,9,"Amber color. Aroma of soft fruit sweet corn caramel light toffee and a hint of mint. Light to medium in body and smooth. On the palate notes of caramel coated fruit corn and delicate toffee notes becoming gently dry with notes of vanilla and mint."
1488,9,"Honeyed citrus vanilla and hints of toasted coconut on the nose.  Similar follow-through on the palate—sweeter up front and then becoming dry with firm spice and toasted nuts. Long resinous warm spice finish.  I’d like a little less dried spice on the finish—or more sweetness to balance it. Otherwise a nice bourbon."
1489,8,"A delicate nose of golden raisin Cracker Jack peanuts pleasing citrus and hints of clove. The palate is fairly straightforward in its honeyed sweetness and warm cereal notes with hints of tobacco leaf. Not exciting but enjoyable in an understated way and a nice leisurely sipper."
1490,2,"From Texas-based Treaty Oak Distilling distilled from corn and wheat and aged 12 months. The relatively low ABV is by design to make this a “sessionable” whiskey. Herbal on the nose with lots of barrel influence. Light on the palate but full in texture with notes of maple syrup blueberry pie cooked peaches and new oak followed by a spiced finish. The overall profile is light but with sippable flavors."
1491,9,"The first release in the “Whiskey Row” series. Nicely balanced flavors with a youthful kick. Fairly straightforward in profile with plenty of spice (cinnamon clove mint and nutmeg) citrus fruit (orange tangerine grapefruit) and honey vanilla. Dry spicy finish. A little rough around the edges but otherwise an enjoyable whiskey."
1492,9,"Quite the antithesis of the Signature Craft 12 year old released at the same time. This one is finished in Spanish brandy barrels so I expect it to be a polarizing whiskey. The brandy influence shows with sweet fruit (sultana honeyed tangerine pineapple ripe apricot) and spice (vanilla cinnamon ginger) interwoven with caramel. No age statement. Youthful but not immature. A limited edition release."
1493,2,"One of two single barrel bourbons distilled in 2015 this one selected by Firestone & Robertson co-founder Troy Robertson. The nose is somewhat green but offers notes of iced tea candied orange graham crackers and antique closet. The palate has flavors of dark chocolate tea leaves roasted nuts mint wild herbs and barrel char. The finish is barrel-forward with more char drying tobacco and roasted coffee beans."
1494,13,"An unusual mashbill of 51% corn 44% malted barley and 5% rye gives this whiskey notes of spearmint chile flakes Nesquik powder and cherry pie. There’s more chocolate on the palate in the form of mocha and cocoa powder along with pistachio and herbal oak. A bitter finish paired with the silky mouthfeel leaves things slightly off-balance but the earthy chocolate notes show signs of promise for this oddity. (5000 bottles)"
1495,9,"The whiskey’s formula has been improved and now consists of a higher percentage of older whiskies (into the high teens) than the original release (which I rated 81). Nicely balanced with candied fruit blackberry jam soft vanilla kettle corn and a kiss of mint. Pleasant unpretentious and uncomplicated."
1496,5,"Delicate and flavorful chocolate caramel and dried fruit begin a delightful sipper that really becomes easy drinking with hints of cola cherry and maple syrup. Then it’s the spice specifically cinnamon and allspice over a slight bitterness like grapefruit rind that suggests complexity awaits. But no the short finish hurts its next-level consideration. Price is per 375 ml"
1497,9,"The second 20 year old single barrel release sold at Heaven Hill’s Bourbon Heritage Center. (I rated the first one a 96.) Like its predecessor this one sports a beautiful nose — and beginning of the palate — with toffee nougat pecan pie and coconut truffle. But some fairly aggressive tactile oak on the finish keeps this whiskey from earning a higher rating."
1498,9,"Single barrel and not chill-filtered. Notably spicy (especially cinnamon) and gripping on the palate — the ten years in oak are not lost here. Some botanical notes too especially toward the finish. Somewhat aggressive but underlying notes of caramel candy corn and ripe tangerine help soften the blow. Despite its slightly imposing personality it shows character and never steps over the line. (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.)"
1499,9,"Not overly challenging. Stylish and very easy to embrace. I would introduce a new bourbon drinker to this kind of bourbon. Pleasingly sweet with honeyed vanilla graham cracker candy corn dates and golden raisin. Subtle spice (cinnamon mint cocoa and nutmeg) leading to a smooth silky finish. I would love to see this at 45% ABV or even higher as it comes across almost too soft. But for this price I’m not complaining. A great value."
1500,12,"The nose has fruity hard candy citrus oil and lime Popsicle stick along with expressive grain. On the palate the sturdy proof holds up well to a few drops of water revealing iced herbal tea mint leaves cinnamon black pepper and orange oil as well as plenty of chewy oak. The finish is where this whiskey’s personality really starts to show offering rich dark chocolate and roasted almonds."
1501,12,"Lots to unpack on the nose: dried orange peel blueberry maple syrup herbs and fragrant spices—cinnamon allspice clove caraway; with water green papaya and cedar. The palate is dry and chewy with oak orange cinnamon clove cedar oil roasted nuts chocolate and crushed red pepper. It finishes simply with dry oak nutty chocolate and cinnamon."
1502,2,"Notes of red fruit blueberry dried cherries Grape Nuts lemon oil and an herbal spiciness on the nose balanced against an influence of drying oak. The palate is smooth and light with cinnamon milk chocolate peanut shells green pepper and oak tannins. The finish is sweet and offers a tropical note of sweet orange and lemon. This whiskey is light but the four-grain mashbill creates an intriguing non-traditional profile."
1503,2,"A nose of dark fruit figs sassafras powdered orange candy and brown sugar leads to a palate that’s lightly nimble with vanilla iced tea lemon cracked pepper and textured oak. Water brings out sweeter notes with orange and strawberry balanced against herbal flavors and eucalyptus. The finish is sweet and a bit light tasting of sliced orange vanilla syrup toasted oak and roasted herbs. A balanced light and somewhat non-traditional bourbon."
1504,12,"Uncommonly delicate and floral: a bundle of honeysuckle and grandma’s potpourri on the nose mingled with cantaloupe almond milk rice pudding peach and Nilla Wafer. It fills the mouth with an oily texture and flavors of tropical fruit peach melon hazelnut and citrus soap finishing with lingering tobacco and nuts. Town Branch uses the same proprietary yeast for this bourbon as its Pearse Irish whiskey which may explain the unusual flavor profile."
1505,8,"A simple and enjoyable whiskey with pleasant sweetness and fresh oak sawdust on the somewhat tight nose. While light-bodied on the palate there is a nice oiliness to the texture as flavors of toasted marshmallow fresh citrus and gentle cedar give way to a finish with some clove spice. (39756 bottles)"
1506,12,"Sweet and fruity to start with Swedish fish orange Creamsicle circus peanuts and some dusty spices: pepper caraway and allspice. There’s zippier spice and citrus on the palate along with chili-chocolate peanut brittle cherry cough syrup and a little leathery oak on the finish. It’s soft and light-bodied—serviceable but not exciting. (Total Wine & More)"
1507,12,"Aromas of dry cedar used sandpaper and hay mingle with candied fruit—green apple Jolly Rancher Asian pear—along with earthy tea leaves. The wood-forward palate highlights more tea leaves dried apple rings apple skins gentle clove spice and cedar. It finishes with dry wood cloves and a hint of dried orange peel. A peculiar whiskey that seems unsure of itself."
1508,12,"Oily earthy and a bit vegetal on the nose with nori moss caramel corn toasted pecans barbecue potato chips and butterscotch haystacks. The oily-textured palate is heavy on smoky char roasted corn and nuts savory mesquite-cooked meat and spearmint. On the finish it’s all cigar wrapper dark chocolate mint oil and coffee bean with plenty of lingering char flavor."
1509,2,"The nose begins with a whiff of new wood but moves to orange peel apricot green banana raisin bread black tea and raspberry Popsicle. The palate is youthful and syrupy in texture with notes of milk chocolate burnt almond vanilla frosting and chili spice. The finish is barrel-influenced but light and honeyed with notes of milk chocolate nuttiness and spice."
1510,9,"This whiskey’s signature over the last several years has been wood dominant with plenty of dried spice (the exception being the 2013 release which I really enjoyed—it was chock full of balancing sweetness). The 2014 release is similar to the pre-2013 releases with dried spice (cinnamon vanilla) and dried citrus on a soft bed of maple syrup caramel and honey leading to resinous oak grip on the finish. A dynamic bourbon but still leaning heavily on the oak spice."
1511,12,"Faintly herbal but mostly sweet aromas: Swedish fish Twizzlers treacle marshmallow and toasted almonds as well as Lipton tea bag and pine needles. The flavor is dominated by oak along with charred corn black pepper roasted nuts and pipe tobacco while the finish takes a slight turn with lingering pine and cigar notes."
1512,2,"This bourbon is named for the Special Forces horsemen known as the horse soldiers who served in Afghanistan. The nose starts earthy and herbal with notes of leather licorice and light smokiness. Drying oak on the palate with bitter orange and herbal notes roasted walnuts and burnt cinnamon and brown sugar. A finish of orange bitter chocolate and espresso beans. Water coaxes out raspberry and honey blossom."
1513,9,"This might the most drinkable Evan Williams Single Barrel vintage ever produced. Its most noticeable personality trait is sweetness (gentle not cloying) with notes of caramel corn vanilla custard candied fruit and subtle macaroon. Spearmint cinnamon nutmeg and charcoal provide some zest. Soft and clean on the finish with gentle oak resin. A smooth easy ride from beginning to end."
1514,9,"This Jefferson’s bourbon spent most of its life (almost four years) on a boat in the ocean. All that rocking and environmental conditioning has this whisky tasting four to five times its age. Yes there’s plenty of resinous oak and leather but there are also balancing notes of molasses treacle toffee old demerara rum and roasted nuts. A peppering of cinnamon mint tobacco and maybe…yes brine add intrigue."
1515,8,"The nose is a bit hot and generally restrained with dried leaves earthiness and waxy crayons. Light-bodied very soft and somewhat juicy. Stone fruit and grain flavors combine for an enjoyable peach-pie quality before the tannic finish."
1516,9,"Situated between siblings Barterhouse and Old Blowhard in flavor profile. Firm spice botanicals dried fruit and a kiss of honey rest on a bed of caramel along with resinous oak leather dark chocolate and a hint of tobacco on the finish. Lovely nose but there's substantial oak on the palate. The sweeter notes make an effort to balance the oak but the oak still dominates. For these who like drier spicier bourbon."
1517,5,"This is a non-chill filtered bottling. Initially it’s perfume-centric with highly floral notes until a grain neutralizer sets in with hints of caramel and vanilla. Cornbread honey and slight hints of pepper herbs and tobacco. Finishes short with a mouthful of lovely sweet corn pudding."
1518,9,"Caramel corn vanilla cream citrus evergreen and a peppering of cinnamon. Soft oak finish. Pleasant straightforward youthful and uncomplicated. Would prefer to see it bottled at a higher strength."
1519,11,"Bottle design looks like it came from a 1950s movie. Did bourbon smell like this then: cornbread and cinnamon seasoned oak and a bare hint of cedar sweet hot dough? Oily and lazy on the tongue a pool of sweet corn fire touched with the cinnamon. The wood is absent but returns at the end with a grip on the tongue and palate. Another great whiskey for the money; great on the rocks from a drawer in a private eye’s desk…"
1520,9,"Amber-walnut color. Deep mature aromas of wood spices mint molasses and dark candied fruit. Thick and mouth coating. Flavors of molasses mint leather dark fruit leading to a very long very dry wood and spice finish. The oldest of the Ezra Brooks line and a very mature expression. Some might find this whiskey a little too woody and dry. Otherwise there's plenty of character and complexity to entertain the palate."
1521,9,"By far the “sweet spot” when compared to its siblings. The most versatile and the best value of the entire portfolio. Good enough to enjoy neat but economical enough to use as a mixer. Caramel corn vanilla soft nougat light barrel char gentle fruit hint of cinnamon and nutmeg.Value Pick."
1522,8,"Some pleasant warm cereal notes emerge like Quaker oats with cinnamon and brown sugar. The palate offers peanuts and spices however young spirit juts out with green stick and slightly antiseptic flavors out of synch with the ample toasted oak. Blind tasted twice with consistent notes."
1523,5,"Commonly referred to as Black Label the color is noticeably dark for a younger  less than 8 year old product like this. The nose takes it a step forward with burnt  brown sugar fruit and cinnamon. But the palate reveals its youth with a mouthful  of grains and acidity. However it’s saved by final notes of honey vanilla caramel  soft oak and coconut. A short finish disappoints but this is a cocktail or cola contender."
1524,5,"Florals and fruit begin a soft and delicate journey. For such a light whiskey it’s certainly heavy on cherries stone fruit apples and marmalade followed by toffee coffee bananas and chocolate. A drop of water shows how delicate it is and the short finish suggests this whiskey would be leaps and bounds better with ten more degrees of proof."
1525,9,"Dry spicy and leathery on the nose with candied fruit and toffee. Similar on the palate but the dryness takes a more demonstrable role especially toward the finish -- leather dried vanilla warming cinnamon and brittle mint with some candied fruit toffee and molasses struggling to prop it all up. Bottom line here: this year’s offering has less of the richness fullness lush fruitiness and sweetness that balanced all the dried spice and leather notes the past two years (I rated both a 94). Still a nice bourbon but a slight setback for Eagle Rare 17 year old."
1527,9,"Broodingly thick and syrupy in texture and quite dry-especially on the finish. Twenty-three years is a long time for bourbon to spend in oak and this one shows its age. The flavors and complexity of its younger two siblings is evident until mid-palate but then dwindles slightly as the whisky progresses replaced by dry spicy leathery sooty-charcoal tobacco notes."
1528,9,"The successor to Barton Brand’s Ridgewood Reserve 1792 bourbon. An improved successor too. This bourbon is much more rounded than the Ridgewood and has shed the aggressively dry woody finish. The Ridgemont sports a nice silky texture. On the palate gently sweet notes of vanilla caramel and candied fruit balance nicely with dry spicy notes of mint cinnamon and green tea with just a hint of tobacco on the finish."
1529,9,"Dark and mysterious. Thick and chewy. Notes of fig cake glazed fruit oak resin tobacco and cedar. Bold spicy finish balances the chewy sweetness. A digestif if not an entire meal."
1530,13,"Actors Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley introduce this 4 year old Indiana bourbon made with 64% corn 22% rye and an undisclosed percentage of wheat and malted barley. The nose is corn-forward and sweet: notes of candy corn butterscotch candies and orange Popsicle. The palate is light-bodied making it highly sippable; vanilla pudding a touch of honey and boiled peanuts. That light and sweet quality carries over to the finish. No water necessary."
1531,9,"New packaging new formulation and even a new strength. The new packaging is more stylish the new formulation is more approachable as is the new strength (45% rather than 50.5%). The previous Russell’s Reserve was big and brooding with huge flavors of chewy toffee oak leather and tobacco. This new expression is more elegant with lighter sugars (honey cotton candy caramel maple syrup) more fruit (candied orange pineapple coconut) and creamy vanilla. A tame expression of Wild Turkey (although the flavors are nicely balanced and seamlessly tied together). Ideally I would like to see the bourbon with the new formula but bottled at the old strength of 101 proof."
1532,12,"Banana peel pencil shavings florist’s shop and rose garden lined with herb beds on the nose. Oak takes the lead on the palate but is tempered by lemon and orange zest sweet black licorice chocolate peanuts and popcorn. Crushed peanuts milk chocolate and pencil shavings persist on the finish although it’s fairly short."
1533,12,"The barrel shows itself up front: cigar box fresh pencils dried chili allspice and tea leaves along with a touch of honeydew. The palate is roasty and oak-driven: chili powder cacao roasted nuts and savory salty grilled meat. An austere finish with white pepper dry oak and cocoa powder."
1534,12,"Overripe fruit orange Creamsicle (and its stick) cedar oil and wood spice on the nose. The palate is tannic with robust orange oak cinnamon cherry Luden’s cough drops and herbal cough syrup. It finishes on oak chocolate nuts and cinnamon—a bit hot but softened with generous water."
1535,5,"At 3 years 6 months this whiskey shows so much promise. As most young bourbons do this one starts with hints of oak and a mouthful of corn that develops into cornbread and corn pudding over subtle hints of pralines and chocolate. Then out of nowhere raw almonds and pecan shell. The medium finish ends with a touch of cinnamon. High hopes for this one. In another year or two we could be talking about something really special. Price is per 375 ml."
1536,9,"Moderately rich with layered caramel vanilla fig cake and subtle sweet corn. Date raisin and a dusting of spice (cinnamon cocoa hint of ginger) round out the palate leading to a gently sweet soothing finish. A very versatile bourbon — certainly enjoyable enough to drink neat but you won’t feel guilty if you make a cocktail with it or drink it on the rocks."
1537,12,"The nose is innocuous with some cinnamon herbal iced tea sweet oranges cedar and dry oak. Sweet and wood-forward on the palate it is also drying and hot with herbal tea orange oil chocolate cinnamon and cherry cough syrup. While there are flavors to enjoy here they seem to need more time to fully develop. (Trader Joe’s)"
1538,11,"A toasty nose with bright citrus spice and oaky vanilla; you can feel the heat. Clearly Beam but just as clearly different; there’s a flat spread to this and a dry pull on the tongue and in the finish. Six-row barley has more husk to it which can add tannins to beer; is there enough here to make a difference? It’s an interesting character but it’s not all good. Price is per 375 ml."
1539,11,"Nose is thin and sweet smelling of popped corn and a bit of oak and vanilla. Mellow and smooth in the mouth with warm corn and corn syrup notes more oak and vanilla but nothing overpoweringly sweet; good balance. Some oak in the finish a slight curl on the tongue that's not unpleasant. “Single Barrel” but no barrel number given. Sourced whiskey."
1540,12,"Aromas of spiced orange and lemon cedar bubblegum and caramel spar with the fresh wood aromas of a sawmill. On the palate ginger white pepper and oak are counterbalanced by a wave of sweetness: orange oil bubblegum and strawberry-flavored Fruit Roll-Ups. A touch of water benefits this somewhat simple pour."
1541,11,"Sweet fresh corn and fruit—apple skins white grapes dried apricot—tangle with spicy cinnamon and circus peanuts. Quite smooth indeed especially at 50%. Light toasted corn like corn flakes cereal with the spice and fruit leading to a subtly layered finish (oak fruit a bit of milk chocolate). A late-morning bourbon easy and friendly."
1542,2,"The nose begins with lemon and lime followed by notes of licorice root and dill. The palate is smoother and sweeter if a bit light with notes of cherry chocolate cinnamon and new oak. The addition of water reveals flavors of orange pekoe tea peanut shells a richer note of chocolate and a dusting of chili powder. Some barrel influence on the palate but the finish concludes with chocolate sassafras and bitter almond oil."
1543,12,"Light in aroma with nougat pistachio halvah fresh lilies and the chalkiness of general store candy. Flavor and mouthfeel are also subtle sometimes too much so; while there are lovely floral and fruit notes along with spices pistachio toasted grain and orange oil a bit more amplitude would go a long way."
1544,9,"A relatively high rye grain content for a bourbon (36%). The port adds richness (fleshy fruit) and helps the whiskey taste older than it really is (by masking some of its youthfulness?). Notes of ripe cherry soft plum mandarin orange in syrup dates and toffee. The spices (cinnamon mint and a dusting of cocoa) pick up mid-palate and finish strong and warming. A slight bit more port than I would prefer but the spice vibrancy still shines through."
1545,2,"A blend of two straight bourbons—a pot still expression from Spirits of French Lick double distilled and aged 2 years and a pot-and-column still bourbon sourced from a Wyoming distillery aged 7 years. A youthful nose is grain-forward and restrained with notes of dried leaves crushed juniper berries and licorice. A palate of bitter orange and black tea finishing with clove baking spices bitter chocolate and baked apple."
1546,11,"Nose of sweet cinnamon candy wintergreen and wet wood. Wintergreen and hot/sweet cinnamon carry through on the palate with light vanilla and some pleasant oak around the edges. Happy shiny whiskey but you realize what’s missing when you get to the finish…and there isn’t one. Incredibly quick on the finish and pretty simple throughout. It’s like summer love: fun but shallow and over quickly. Sourced whiskey."
1547,12,"Made with an unusual mashbill—corn wheat caramel malt and oats—this whiskey was aged for 2 years. Grain bread dough almond paste and a hint of cinnamon on the nose. The palate has fresh wood shavings cinnamon bread dough orange Popsicle and walnuts with a dry chocolate and oak finish. A bit more maturation time should soften some of the youthful edges."
1548,9,"Gentle in personality and predominantly sweet with notes of honeyed vanilla caramel maple syrup coconut cream pie and a hint of red licorice. Underlying bright fruit suggestions of green tea and a dusting of cinnamon keep the whiskey lively and upbeat. A soft toasted oak finish tames the sweetness and provides balance. The whiskey is more approachable and easier to drink than a typical bourbon containing rye-the spicy rye intensity isn’t there. Some bourbon enthusiasts will miss the challenge-and rewards-that the rye would normally provide. For this reason this whiskey will be more appealing to drinkers of wheated bourbons (e.g. Maker’s Mark Old Fitzgerald W.L. Weller). It is an interesting change of pace from the standard bourbon fare and it is a unique exploration of American whiskey without sacrificing authenticity."
1549,9,"Placed in a new barrel after 8 years and 8 months. Very spicy with an oak sappiness. Loads of maple syrup and corn sweetness up front with the spice and some subtle lush fruit kicking in mid-palate. Leather and tobacco follow through to a very masculine dry oak finish. While a very enjoyable whiskey the dominant hot and lingering oak on the finish keeps me from scoring it as high as its siblings."
1550,9,"Aged in Zinfandel barrels for eight years after spending ten years in new charred oak. Quite similar in flavor profile but with more oak influence (as would be expected) when compared to its younger brother. The oak spices and resinous textures are more prominent on the nose and palate in this whiskey and they linger on the finish which ultimately becomes slightly leathery and tannic. Still an entertaining intriguing whiskey. (But read between the lines-buy the younger expression.)"
1551,12,"Citrus oil freshly cut wood tea leaves baking spice and maple candy on the nose; with water added more herbal and floral notes emerge including mint star anise and fresh chamomile. Medium-bodied the palate has orange peel licorice star anise brown sugar and plenty of fresh oak; here adding water doesn't benefit the balance. It finishes quickly with black pepper oak and more star anise."
1552,12,"Led by raw grain and new oak on the nose it also has aromas of cedar spiced almonds green banana and marshmallow. The palate shows plenty of wood with pulling tannins as well as black pepper vanilla orange and bitter almond. It’s more oak and grain on the finish which fades quickly. Some promising qualities here but this whiskey needs more time in the barrel."
1553,9,"A very hearty Birthday Bourbon. Richly textured with lush sweet notes of jammy berried fruit coconut cream pie and apple crisp married with firm dry notes of fresh mint warming cinnamon and vanilla. Dry polished leather finish. The oak-influenced dryness on the finish lingers longer than I would like and the flavors aren’t integrated as well as last year’s version (which is understandable given that last year’s release was Malt Advocate magazine’s American Whiskey of the Year). This is certainly an entertaining whisky. Save it for after dinner though."
1554,9,"Gently sweet vanilla corn and honey on the nose with background spice and dried citrus. The same sweet notes show on the first half of the palate with resinous oak polished leather and dried spice on the back end; the quarter cask aging is evident. Unfortunately the sweet flavors and dried oak influence don’t marry very well with too much sweetness and youthfulness up front and too much oak bringing up the rear."
1555,9,"This whiskey is produced utilizing a solera system similar to the way sherry is aged and is said to contain some whiskey distilled at Stitzel-Weller. Thick and viscous in texture. Orchard fruit (orange apricot pear) on the front of the palate segueing to honeyed vanilla dried pit fruits and dried spice (evergreen cinnamon) leading to a warm finish. Intriguing but lacking polish to garner a higher rating."
1556,9,"Light and airy on the nose and delicately creamy on the palate. Gently sweet personality with caramel custard vanilla bean candy corn and crème brulee. Shows more oak on the palate than the nose with increasing dried spice notes on the finish. A peculiar whiskey if not overly complex or inspiring.Price is per 375 ml."
1557,11,"Sharp nose a bit of heat fresh ground/cracked spices—cinnamon pepper allspice—and hot sugar about to caramelize. There’s nothing soft here. The first crash on the tongue isn’t soft either; it’s rushing bonded heat insistent pepper and dry oak. Wait a bit and it calms as you finally find the corn and the mouth widens then slides into a dryer lasting finish. Pretty wild ride for a wheated bourbon."
1558,9,"A soft delicate bourbon -- especially when compared to its single barrel siblings here. Subtle notes of candied fruit and creamy sweet notes (vanilla coconut light toffee and caramel corn) are nicely interwoven. Some integrated gently-dried spice dances throughout and lingers on the finish. An easy-to-embrace bourbon with nice balance."
1559,12,"Butterscotch candy pencil shavings cracked corn cocoa powder fresh ginger and grape cough syrup on the nose. The palate is nutty with toasted oak and hints of pine licorice and spearmint and the finish is blunt dominated by wood sugar."
1560,9,"Clean and uncomplicated bourbon. Creamy sweet layers of vanilla caramel and toffee are underpinned by soft citrus fruit gentle mint teaberry and delicate oak. Here’s a bourbon certainly good enough to drink on its own but you won’t feel guilty throwing it in a mixed drink. Nice for everyday drinking."
1561,9,"More wood influence than the standard Jim Beam White Label. It’s a bit more robust bolder and with more wood spices (especially cinnamon and vanilla) and a curious botanical note. Throw in some corn caramel and honey and this is what you get. Behind all that I’m detecting a bit of youthfulness — I might like this bourbon with more age and less “devil.”"
1562,9,"One of the biggest Birthday Bourbons to date. This whiskey was aged on the top corner of a warehouse where the temperature extremes are at their greatest. The greater the temperature extreme the greater the impact of the barrel. The wood is immediately noticeable on the nose and palate-there are plenty of concentrated dried spice notes throughout. Dried vanilla mint fiery cinnamon cedar and assorted fruits are sweetened and calmed by notes of maple syrup and toffee. Until about mid-palate that is. Then another wave of dried spices kicks in remaining through the finish. For serious bourbon drinkers."
1564,5,"Warmth. Bakery flavors set in right away illustrating both sweet and spice: cinnamon bread vanilla yellow cake batter gingersnaps no-bake oatmeal cookies. Then hints of smoke dark cherries chipotle pepper and a slight hint of butterscotch. As is it disappointingly finishes short with a hint of cardamom. Water adds caramel complexity to the previously short finish."
1565,11,"The base bottling of the “new” I.W. Harper from Diageo. Source is “new” Bernheim; no age given. Nose is simple: hard candy and corn. A fairly simple and somewhat thin mouth as well: sweet with hints of ripe melon and apple and an edge of oak dryness. Finishes well with a cleanly sweet spiciness. Table bourbon though a bit pricey for that."
1566,9,"One year older than last year’s 20 year old release (which I felt was on the precipice of being over-oaked) and the extra year is evident. On the nose the whiskey is nicely balanced. The palate tells a different story with soft vanilla honey caramel dried fruit and cinnamon segueing into dominant leather tobacco and resinous oak on a long dry finish. I fear bottling this whiskey annually one year older is going in the wrong direction."
1567,11,"More MGP whiskey: 2 years old 51% corn 45% wheat 5% malt. That’s a lot of wheat and you can smell it: soft sweet even a bit doughy with a little mint candy. Extremely smooth but not insipid; there’s some nice oak backbone here a good weight and a solid center of corn. Craftsmanlike. And $1 from every bottle goes to veterans programs. Sourced whiskey."
1568,9,"The new younger sibling to George T. Stagg. George T.’s signature is its bold nature and high proof and Junior follows in its footsteps. The aromas are very nice: bold spice (clove dusty mint cinnamon evergreen) with layers of burnt sugars cocoa charred oak and berried fruit. However on the palate those sugars become dominated by aggressive spice leather and unnecessary tannin most notably on the finish. Spend a little more and opt for George T. Stagg instead."
1569,9,"There’s a reason why bourbon distillers don’t char their barrels to this intensity. Aged over 15 years this is a bold whiskey with lovely honeyed fruit and creamy vanilla on the nose and palate. But it’s bullied by the charred oak brandishing oak tannins and leather along with background tobacco and over-roasted nuts. Dry charred oak finish. There’s a lovely sweetness that does challenge all this charred oak but it eventually loses the battle. Price is per 375ml."
1570,12,"The nose is grainy with strong wood notes and hints of vanilla lilac and cinnamon candies. Flavors of caramel vanilla spice and citrus tussle with cedar tea leaves and oak tannins before a lengthy assertive finish of tobacco caramel cinnamon clove and orange peel.

This or whiskey has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: varies usually 3 to 6 months;
Processing: Distillate from Indiana and Ohio is aged in new charred oak barrels before undergoing Cleveland’s proprietary process using new charred oak pieces."
1571,12,"Yes this is named for the beach in Australia and its light character might well be intended for seaside sipping. Orange blossom lemon and cinnamon gum vie with Popsicle stick on the nose. The light-bodied palate has more orange cinnamon candy nuttiness and a lot of oak that becomes cloying on the finish. Overall it has the effect of making one wish there were just a bit more body and character."
1572,5,"You can actually smell the cooper toasting oak here so the name carries real meaning. Then cotton candy fresh-baked rye vanilla apple and caramel come to life. A slight hint of grain becomes more expressive on the tongue offering bread-like flavors with hints of brown sugar and honey. Short finish with a hint of grain. If you like light-bodied bourbons this is right up your alley."
1573,5,"Highly anticipated this release offers freshly-popped kettle corn cinnamon nutmeg oak hints of fruit and floral. Then it feels unbalanced a bitter woodiness hiding hopeful flavors. Once the wood disappears there’s caramel vanilla and baking spice over heat. A drop of water corrects the dominant oak and gives this a sipper’s chance."
1574,9,"Chewy toffee and nougat with some dusty corn notes along with minty rye and cinnamon. The whiskey’s fruit is subtle and subdued finishing boldly dry with oaky vanilla and leather. Not as bright and intensely spicy as the Sazerac Rye 18 year old on the market and it’s the antithesis of the younger Sazerac Rye 6 year old also reviewed in this Buyer’s Guide. An enjoyable mature rye whiskey."
1575,9,"The label says 10 years old but this tastes more like bourbon in its mid teens. A big bourbon and quite the antithesis of the 80 Strong below. Sweet notes of maple syrup and toffee are quickly taken over by firm mint and dried fruits which then yields to emerging notes of polished leather roasted nuts and dry resinous oak. Long spicy dried finish with cinnamon mint and oak. For those who like their bourbon bold and with plenty of oak impact. (Bottled exclusively for Bayway World of Liquor.)"
1576,9,"Each of these three bourbons was distilled and bottled at the same time and aged in the same warehouse for 12 years and 3 months. The main variable was the floor they were aged on. In theory the higher up in the warehouse the greater the temperature variation and the more wood influence. Does the experiment support this general concept? Yes with the sweet spot being the middle floor.

A much deeper bolder spicier drier and (at times) harsher bourbon when compared to the other two in this experiment aged on the first and fifth floor. The wood influence (notes of barrel char leather and tannin) from the barrel dominate the pleasing sweet and fruit notes found in the other two. This is for those who like their bourbon with plenty of oak influence. Best served after a large rich meal. Price is per 375 ml."
1577,11,"Sourced bourbon at 3 to 10 years old was dumped and finished in Napa Valley wine barrels. The nose is mostly bourbon—corn warm meadow hard candy—with a floater of wine wood; I'm guessing white wine. The flavor is quite woody but not old wood; fresher and a bit astringent overshadowing the whiskey. Not sure the finish does it a favor. Sourced whiskey."
1578,5,"The new packaging of Old Grand-Dad doesn’t say bottled in bond but only “bonded.” At first look the impression is not good. The straw color makes me think it’s young. Then grains burst out of the glass with a hint of mint. Is this repackaged young whiskey? Then to my surprise an explosion. Baking spices freshly baked bread and cinnamon roll bring this whiskey home. I’d love to taste it after a few more years in the barrel but it’s mighty tasty as it is now."
1579,11,"A blend of three bourbons between 6 and 12 years old; two rye and one wheat. Nothing is revealed on the source which is a fair part of the “blood oath” apparently. A restrained nose of corncakes biscuits a bit of cinnamon and maple: breakfasty. Flavors of corn spicy oak and some grassy mint fight to be heard over roaring heat that flames on into the finish. Frankly too simple for the asking price. Sourced whiskey."
1580,5,"Once a 7 year old product W.L. Weller Special Reserve no longer carries an age statement but the wheated bourbon still brings caramel-forward joy and hints of watermelon and fresh-baked bread. Enjoy the short bursts of crème brulee praline honey Jolly Rancher watermelon candy and a hint of nutmeg because it’s not there long. You can see the potential."
1581,11,"Despite the common Heaven Hill origin this is not the same stuff as Dant. The nose is focused dry integrated: sweet corn the inside of an old wooden drawer and a flip of sweet spice. Lively in the mouth almost playfully light: corn fritters and filigreed oak. If you mix this go light; this is not a heavy bonded trooper. One cube a small splash; then enjoy the delicacy."
1582,13,"From the inventive minds at Barrell comes this whiskey a blend of three Tennessee bourbons each finished separately in Jamaican rum pear brandy and Sicilian amaro casks. The nose is highly fruity and herbal almost gin-like with notes of mint grass lemon and lime pineapple slices and wild strawberries. The palate is candied with Smarties Runts and mango. The finish is more of the same with lemon-lime candies. The unorthodox cask treatment creates some unexpected flavors with the high proof amplifying the peculiarity."
1583,11,"No age statement “charcoal filtered.” Hard candy/sweet-spicy nose with some wood edginess stewed corn and mineral notes; not particularly well-integrated. The thin body flashes vanilla and light caramel across the tongue as some hot oak fires things up. On the lean side and like most such bourbons the finish lingers and flares at each swallow: oak cinnamon and that same mineral note. Not bad but it needs more. Sourced whiskey."
1584,11,"Simple nose of sweet cornbread and oaky caramel; nothing fancy but nothing wrong. The nose is no liar; same tastes in the
mouth just a bit hotter on the oak. Good finish with a nice oaky linger. The letdown is the thin body which adds to the heat and steals from the experience. Seems more like a good shot bourbon or an “…and ginger ale” bourbon not a sipping bourbon. Sourced whiskey."
1585,9,"Interestingly crisper than and not as rich as the 17 year old with warming oak spice to accompany the light toffee cocoa powder “corn in a burlap sack” sultana and dusty mint. Peppery spicy oak finish that lingers. The fieriest of the three."
1586,9,"Comprised of bourbon aged 6 to 8 years old (and seems closer to 6 than 8). This new fairly bold for 81 proof whiskey while drinkable neat or with a splash of water really works best as a mixer. Very traditional bourbon notes of caramel vanilla mint cinnamon sweet corn and orchard fruit."
1587,9,"Silky and sweet up front with English toffee and lush bright honeyed fruit.  But similar to the “Rye 90” release leather and oak resin dominate the back end of the palate through the finish. More balance is needed to warrant a higher rating. Price is per 375 ml."
1588,9,"Easy-going and uncluttered but also not very complex. Balanced straightforward notes of caramel vanilla creamed corn subtle fruit soft mint and delicate cinnamon. A versatile bourbon: you won’t feel guilty using it in a cocktail and it will do in a pinch to drink neat or with a splash of water."
1589,5,"Somewhat forgotten this table bourbon is ripe with fired-corn salsa citrus zest and a hint of butterscotch. It could use another year or two in the barrel but the grains caramel and fruit (with a hint of spice) are delicious on their own. Want a house bourbon for cocktails? This is a fine pick."
1590,5,"At 6 years 4 months and 4 days old there’s a bit of an old-school bourbon nose with caramel and butterscotch leading. Chocolate cinnamon and nutmeg follow. What starts out promising turns to grain opening up to cornbread freshly baked rye bread and vanilla cupcake batter. Once the chewy-to-dry mouthfeel is established there’s walnut bread rice pudding and buttered toast over heat. With water the grain disappears and malty caramel dominates. This needs water or ice to maximize potential."
1591,9,"Finished in toasted maple wood. I love the nose on this: complex notes of rum golden raisin maple syrup nougat polished leather and warming cinnamon. The love continues on the palate but toward the finish the flavors turn a bit aggressive (leather tannins) which somewhat tarnishes an otherwise exciting well-orchestrated whiskey."
1592,11,"Nose of corn and subdued Beam spiciness. It’s hot and sweet and minty-spicy but the main difference from mainline Beam is the feel. This is slicker lighter slippery and the finish has a softness to it almost plushy. The oak seems lost (for an 11 year old) and that lets the sweetness dominate. It’s like a toy breed; it yips when it should bark and growl. I think oats are too soft for bourbon. Price per 375 ml."
1593,11,"MGP bourbon aged to 4 years. Sweet and brittle nose hot and a bit spicy but thin. More spice and body on the tongue than the Old Hickory Blended and a more balanced finish but still a relatively light whiskey. Beautiful bottle classic label; I wish there was more whiskey here. Sourced whiskey."
1594,11,"Thin corn sweetness nice splash of mint and cinnamon. The whiskey's warm but not hot and it's exceptionally smooth. There's a slice of rye spice and oaky vanilla and the finish is clean and sweet. But it's almost too smooth and not gutsy enough; if Stagg is bourbon turned up to eleven this is at about six and a half. Cedar Ridge has a great start here; now show me more."
1595,11,"Sharpish nose hot corn peppermint a bit of grape and underlying cocoa. Sweet mouthful of vanilla and corn the cocoa's here and some oakspice. Finish is a bit rough and hot but not unpleasant. This works better than the sherry-assisted takeoff of their rye whiskey. Could be more rounded but it's well-constructed and solid."
1596,12,"The caramel on the nose is a bit strange and chemical but the palate offers promise with its pleasing spice sweetness orange peel chocolate and silky mouthfeel. There are lovely flavors but the oak feels layered on rather than integrated.

This whisky has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: minimum 12 months;
Processing: Distilled in Indiana and aged in new charred oak barrels then put through a finishing process using sherry-seasoned Spanish oak pieces."
1597,12,"Wood spice dominates the nose with citrus floral and tobacco barn aromas. The palate has pleasant orange peel spice red apple and vanilla notes with a robust heat; however toasted oak continues to reign. One for the wood lover.

This whisky has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: minimum 12 months;
Processing: Distilled in Kentucky and aged in new charred oak barrels before undergoing the TerrePURE process."
1598,5,"With its straw color this looks nothing like a 6 year old but its aroma and taste justify the age statement. Caramel-covered popcorn cooked grains Nutella honey and toasted rye bread. No one flavor overpowers another as an assortment of sweet and spice project over a chewy mouthfeel. The medium finish shows decent caramel. This is nice but doesn’t wow the palate. Sourced whiskey."
1599,9,"Aged in French oak chardonnay barrels for eight years after ten years in new oak. The oak influence is significantly greater in this bottling. Briefly sweet up front with caramel vanilla candied fruit and golden raisin. Then the oak resin leather and tobacco leaves take over along with subtle black licorice stick. The dry oak finish lingers."
1600,9,"Antique amber in color. Deep mature aromas of toffee wood spices mint and leather. Medium in body. The flavor begins sweet with honeyed vanilla and toffee notes evolving to dried fruit and spices and then becoming dry woody and a bit hot. Long dry finish."
1601,5,"Brown-Forman has made Old Forester since 1870. It sure is easy on the eyes: beautiful tawny hues against the light of sunset. Think Southern bakery. Lots of caramel vanilla freshly baked cornbread nutmeg cherry pie and cocoa. Then add the spiciness. These delicious flavors don’t last long making me wonder how it would fare with just a couple more years in the barrel."
1602,9,"Darker more lush and with less of the crisp lively spice notes when compared to last year’s vintage. (Keep in mind that single cask bottlings vary from cask to cask.) The predominant component of the new vintage is its layers of sweetness (toffee molasses vanilla fudge and candy corn) with underlying nougat and glazed fruit. An enjoyable soothing bourbon but I would like to see more spice and fruit to go with the sweet notes. This whiskey will work nicely after dinner (perhaps with a cigar?)"
1603,9,"Finished in pinot noir barrels. A very fruit-forward whiskey. I love bourbon and I love pinot noir but the wine influence is very intense and to me the flavors don’t integrate well. Cherries red raspberry and red currant dominate along with a coating of caramel. Cinnamon and clove struggle to emerge from underneath it all. Sweet fruity finish. Bonus points for uniqueness but a bit overdone with the wine influence."
1604,9,"Style: Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey Color: Amber Aroma: Clean uncomplicated. Notes of caramel teaberry delicate candied fruit and vanilla. Subtle notes of sweet corn and spice (mint). Palate: Well balanced. Similar to its aroma but with more dry spicy notes and less of the sweetness than the nose would suggest. Clean pleasant finish."
1605,9,"Much more oak influence than its younger sibling. That lovely sweetness of the 19 year old Experimental Collection Giant French Oak Barrel bottling is there at the beginning but it’s quickly overtaken by oak spice leather and tannin notes. This one was left in the barrel a bit longer than I would prefer. If you like a wood-driven whiskey then consider trying it. But if it’s balance you desire look elsewhere.  Price is per 375 ml."
1606,11,"Oak and some candy-like sweetness and alcohol heat…and not much else. A shy nose for a bourbon. Very hot in the mouth
somewhat two-dimensional corn and oak just put together without anything else around them. A pretty simple whiskey with a slightly cloying finish. Nothing really flawed just nothing really standing out either. Sourced whiskey."
1607,9,"Light in body with soft fruit graham cracker and delicate honey. Oak tannin leather and prickly spice kick in mid-palate but there’s not enough body and sweet notes to balance it.  Warm spicy finish. Price is per 375 ml."
1608,9,"Aged in American oak and then finished in maple sherry and portwood. The nose is intriguing and entertaining but the palate loses me. At the beginning it’s sweet to the point of bordering on cloying and then there’s an emergence of flavors (wood spice stewed fruit caramel etc.) that turns very busy and lacks integration. The flavors just don’t play well with each other. To me the whiskey is trying too hard to impress and achieves the opposite."
1609,9,"The most intense of the Orphan Barrel initial release.  Very robust with leather tobacco and roasted nuts. Quite spicy and resinous too. Toffee maple syrup and caramel struggle to soothe all this robustness but the oak maintains the upper hand.  A digestif perhaps after a large meal? Unless you are purchasing for a piece of bourbon history my advice would be to try it before you buy because while complex it is also quite woody."
1610,8,"Unmistakable orange nose of marmalade and curaçao dripping with sweet grape jam. Despite all the initial sweetness on the palate it quickly turns hot without really finding a moment of balance. May find fans but generally feels like a well-intentioned experiment that ended up much too heavy-handed. (3000 bottles)—"
1611,9,"Background on the Master’s Collection: this is the fourth of the 100% pot still whiskeys from Woodford Reserve in their Master’s Collection series (the previous being two different Four Grain releases and a Sonoma-Cutrer wine finish expression). All four have a common pot still character to them and their flavors really expand most bourbon drinkers’ concept of bourbon. The second batch of Four Grain is still my clear favorite of the releases so far. It’s balanced and complex.
1838 Sweet Mash review: Burnt orange/amber color. Sweet fruity and spicy on the nose and palate. Notes of orchard fruit (peach apple) golden raisin bramble and spice (cinnamon evergreen nutmeg and clove) on a bed of sweetness (maple syrup and honey). It’s thick and viscous in texture and quite sweet on the front end of the palate but dried spices and oak emerge mid-palate and rescue it. Long spicy resinous finish. I would rather the whisky didn’t go from predominantly sweet to mostly dry and gritty. I wish these two components were better integrated. If they were I would have rated this whiskey higher."
1612,12,"Grassy aromas mingle with white pepper honeysuckle jasmine and newsprint on the nose. The palate rushes through sweet vanilla-cake and ripe fruit flavors with strong oak and alcohol influence to a finish that is mostly wood with some pleasant chocolate and herbal notes. Disjointed at times but water helps bring it together.

This whiskey has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: varies but usually around 3 months;
Processing: Distillate from Indiana and Ohio is aged in new charred oak barrels before undergoing Cleveland’s proprietary process using hickory wood pieces."
1613,5,"A blend of straight bourbons. Light straw color. An expressive dark cherry cooked grains and wood nose opens up to a bevy of custard roasted pine nuts and herbs with hints of tobacco and smoked hazelnuts. A grain-forward approach leaves it slightly unbalanced until roasted nuts save the day with a tinge of vanilla and caramel-flavored popcorn. Sourced whiskey."
1614,5,"Grain in several forms begin this experience. First it’s raw corn kernels freshly buttered popcorn boiled oats rye toast and cornbread. Then oak raisins and slight hints of vanilla develop but the concentrated cornbread dominates after its appearance. However though at a low proof water is needed to cut the heat. Recommended with ice water and/or cola."
1615,5,"Initially it’s earth and fruit. This develops into sawdust more earth and bananas. From here it’s green pepper banana nut bread and warm corn tortillas over a soft mouthfeel with little complexity. This will work in a pinch and it’s great in ginger ale Coca-Cola or lighter cocktails but it’s probably best over ice."
1616,5,"With a mashbill of 72/18/10% (corn/rye/malted barley) Old Forester offers a traditional recipe in a contemporary proof. Ponder the basics: caramel and vanilla with hints of herbs and baking spices. Promise shows in pumpkin spice custard and burnt caramel but there’s an unwanted high-alcohol note that dulls much of the sweeter taste. Its final moments are saved with hints of cinnamon. Good value bourbon."
1617,9,"Youthful simple and uncomplicated. Buttered corn soft vanilla honey and bright fruit with a kiss of spice. Fairly quick finish."
1618,11,"Quite pale looks more like scotch. Nose is hot sweet a bit minty. Hot in the mouth thin sweet with flashy mint and corn. Finish is fiery and a tad bitter with wood especially bitey high in the mouth. Young rough and without the raunchy fullness that can justify youthful braggadocio. There are better bourbons for only a dollar or two more. Sourced whiskey."
1619,11,"Hot oak and bubble gum in the nose with a slight solvent hit of fingernail polish. Light corn in the mouth oaky bitterness a flash of the polish and pretty hot for 40%. A very thin mouthfeel not that
appealing. The nicest thing about it though is the finish which is surprisingly smooth sweet and almost rich. You’d want to dump some cola and ice in here. Sourced whiskey."
1620,9,"This one lacks the balance the other two have. It’s hotter on the palate (even with a liberal addition of water) and I feel the oak plays too large of a role."
1621,9,"XO refers to extra old and this bourbon certainly is that. When compared to Kentucky Vintage it’s drier spicier and more intense on the palate-even when its higher proof is diluted with water. Firm mint resinous oak leather and even a waft of cigar smoke are the highlights of this bourbon. Long dry spicy finish and a bit fiery. For those who like a big bold oak-influenced bourbon."
1622,9,"A straightforward bourbon that takes few risks but also offers few rewards. You’ll find a mélange of orange apricot sweet corn vanilla soft spice and honey. Light youthful finish with a kiss of oak. Sourced whiskey."
1623,5,"What happens when 8 year old bourbon rests in a bourbon barrel-turned-rum barrel for 14 months? This is it. Muted caramel vanilla and spice meet salt dried fruit and almond extract with a short cereal grain finish. An open mind will find this interesting. But for the traditionalist this isn’t bourbon. I applaud the rum cask use but this barrel appears not to be the perfect marriage for my glass."
1624,5,"Wood. From the lumberyard to the charred barrels wood powers over grain caramel vanilla and earth. A nuttiness comes through turning the wood into almond pine nut and pecan but a resounding bitterness stays in the form of nut shells. It lacks balance and complementary flavors to the oak but caramel finds itself on a short finish. Decent first release but I wanted to find more nuance from the second barrel."
1625,11,"Redesigned label wincingly generic in looks even for a bottom-shelf 80 proofer. Whiskey’s quite light in color and smells young as well: sweet a wheated bourbon hint of peanuts and just the faintest hint of wood. Mouth is warm softly corny and a little bittersweet on the finish. But that’s it. Just not much going on here."
1626,11,"A blend of two MGP bourbons 11% 2 year old 89% 4 year old. Simple sweet corn nose with some cinnamon and hard candies; hot for 40%. Underwhelming for a whiskey named for President Jackson; warm and sweet though with some oak-based bitterness at the fringes. Stays sweet through the finish. Not flawed but not well thought-out either. Might be the blandest MGP juice I’ve ever had. Sourced whiskey."
1627,11,"Green corn cooked corn roasted corn all tumbling over each other in the nose. Very sweet young bourbon without much drying from the oak but no youthful fire. Tastes like a lower row barrel. Finish is also sweet. Not a lot of complexity. Sourced whiskey from Dickel."
1628,5,"An odd combo of cornbread and pine trees starts this whiskey just before the grains develop. Think rye bread oatmeal and barley. Then it’s caramel and vanilla before a blast of cinnamon. This whiskey is far too soft and short to hold up as a sipper. It’s best in batched cocktails."
1629,2,"From Spirit Works Distillery in Sonoma County California pot distilled from a blend
of two bourbon formulas that feature 60% corn with wheat rye and barley aged a
minimum of 4 years. Herbs black pepper and caramelized sugar on the nose with
lots of minerality. The palate has notes brown sugar fennel bitter chocolate almond
oil and white pepper followed by a finish of wild herbs and tart spices. (1020
bottles)"
1630,11,"Hot corn vanilla mint and just a touch of oak spice; this one's been in the barrel under 12 months. Whoo it's hot even for 100 proof. All the right parts are here: corn vanilla wood even some mint and no serious off-flavors but it's a rough road. Definitely needs some more time in the barrel but that should do it some good. Gutsy stuff. Price is per 375ml."
1631,9,"Aged in fast-growth wood. Quite the antithesis of the “Fine Grain Oak” release above; the comparison is interesting. Darker fruit (plum blackberry) and darker sugars (maple syrup toffee). Resinous and becoming quickly dry on the palate with leather tobacco leaves grape-stem tannins barrel char and dried spice. A heavier more textural bourbon than the Fine Grain Oak expression. I like this whiskey a lot until the dry leathery oak notes begin to dominate the latter half of the palate. That my friend is the coarse grain oak in action."
1632,12,"Juicy Fruit gum Kool-Aid sugared orange gumdrops and candied papaya and mango meet fresh-cut lumber on the nose. The palate has notes of bruised banana and juicy guava with assertive wood and cocoa powder to balance the sweetness.

This whiskey has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: varies but usually around 3 months;
Processing: Distillate from Indiana and Ohio is aged in new charred oak barrels before undergoing Cleveland’s proprietary process using apple wood pieces."
1633,5,"A composite of 5 7 and 8 year old Kentucky and Tennessee bourbons. It offers exceptional color at this ABV but the grain and oak-forward nose suggests youth with hints of medicinal boiling oatmeal and cinnamon. Slightly dry to adhesive mouthfeel is followed by menthol heavy smoke cinnamon-custard pie licorice caramel and a hint of cherry cough syrup. With the stocks selected for this batch I’d hoped for more but it tastes unlike traditional bourbon. Sourced whiskey."
1634,9,"A bourbon with a gentle demeanor and easy drinkability. The whisky is nicely balanced with sweet notes of corn caramel and vanilla blending in nicely with subtle fruit and dried spice. An uncomplicated fairly straight-forward bourbon for everyday drinking. I just wish there was more to it."
1667,9,"Crown Royal has always been a very stylish silky smooth whisky. This bottling adds a new dimension in flavor and texture with its cognac cask finishing. A velvety smooth whisky with notes of creamy vanilla butterscotch nougat dried fruit and gentle spice are well-defined and nicely balanced. Gently sweet fruity finish. Crown Royal’s best effort to date."
1635,9,"This is pot still Woodford Reserve bourbon finished in Sonoma-Cutrer Chardonnay wine barrels. (It’s the second iteration in the Master’s Collection following the Four Grain release.) The wine influence is immediately obvious-it is sweet and fruity on the nose and palate. Notes of caramel apples toffee pudding butterscotch toasted pecan and peach crisp. Polished oak finish. I’d like a little less sweetness-or a little more of something to balance it like more dried oak spice."
1636,9,"A more significant oak impact when compared to the standard Old Forester bourbons which is evident by the polished leather tobacco and dry resin notes (especially on the finish). There’s an attempt to balance all this wood with notes of dusty corn coconut mint vanilla juniper and dark berried fruit (blueberry black raspberry black cherry) but I don’t think it quite gets there. This bourbon is a nice change of pace (and I understand the reason behind this whisky -- to emulate bourbons from the era of Repeal) but I prefer the Old Forester “Signature” 100 proof to this whiskey. I’m happy drinking the whiskeys of today thank you. (Price is per 375 ml.)"
1637,5,"Take just a moment to admire the color; it’s nearly red after 24 years. Then admire the fragrance with florals fruit caramel and vanilla bargaining for their time over prominent oak. Complexity of earth caramel cinnamon vanilla bitter chocolate light cinnamon sautéed mushrooms watermelon Jolly Rancher and a hint of tobacco. Eventually woodiness and bitterness set in and dominate the palate. Too much wood."
1638,9,"Sweet corn along with caramel vanilla and more subtle ripe summer fruits (on the nose and palate). Light slightly brash finish. Rather sweet somewhat youthful tasting straight-forward and unpretentious. Not something I would be drinking neat but it does fare better on the rocks. (The ice and cold water cut through and calm the sweetness.) I think a little more aging would add some depth and balance some of the sweetness with more oak spice."
1639,9,"Thick on the nose and palate. Nutty toffee chewy caramel milk chocolate and molasses are quickly superseded on the palate by fiery cinnamon dried citrus blackberry cocoa powder barrel char and teasing brisk evergreen. Long warm spicy very dry assertive finish. I like the nose much better than the palate as I feel the dry finish overstays its welcome. A big bold bully of a Birthday Bourbon."
1640,9,"Barton’s entry into the premium small batch bourbon category is a heavy hitter indeed. There are flavors of toffee leather and resinous spices throughout with some background notes of fruit (especially figs and dates) and a dusting of cocoa. This is a full richly textured bourbon. Its aroma is lovely and everything is working well on the palate too-until about mid-palate where it becomes very woody assertive out of balance and quite dry all the way through its finish to the point of becoming excessive. Otherwise this would be a great whiskey."
1641,9,"Antique amber. Deeper brooding and less sweet than the 14 year old bottling. Distinct notes of leather roasted nuts and hints of tobacco on the nose and palate along with some of the flavors of its younger sibling. It works on the nose but the tannins (both from the wine and oak) impart a leather component that just dominates the palate. (I am seeing a pattern here with these younger vs. older whiskeys in the Experimental Collection series. The younger expressions have generally been pretty good while most of the older ones have been aged too long.)"
1642,9,"Aged “over 2 years” and with over 38% rye in the mashbill (high for bourbon). It’s fresh youthful and brisk with sweet corn bright fruit brittle mint cinnamon and a dusting of cocoa leading to a slightly aggressive finish. A bit too youthful actually for sipping—it would benefit from a few more years’ aging. Save this one for your next Manhattan. Its sibling Redemption Rye (of similar age) fares better (84)."
1643,5,"Non-chill filtered plus a lot of age equals oak meeting caramel vanilla earth nuttiness and mildew. Slight hints of anise rose petals tree bark and overcooked rice before over-oaked flavor dominates with medicinal notes and soap. Bitterness earth and a saving grace of herbs follow for a decent albeit woody finish. This is simply over-oaked. I’d love to have tasted this bottled three to seven years ago."
1644,4,"Light in body and flavor but what’s there is well balanced and easy to drink. You’ll find notes of sweet corn caramel coated nuts mint and soft citrus notes. There needs to be more of what’s already there and it needs to be more complex for me to score it in the 80s. The bourbon is designed to compete with the entry level Jack Daniels and from a quality standpoint it does."
1645,11,"Screaming oak nose for a relatively young whiskey; about all that’s there is whiskey-soaked staves and some hot spice. Drillingly-hot entry; I’ve tasted bourbons at 60% that were less hot. Roaring oak fire with some underlying corn sweetness; this isn’t subtle or quiet on the tongue. Water brings out more—sweet corn mint rye oil—but the oak still dominates. Almost astringent in the finish. If you like big oak here it is but forget balance."
1646,5,"It’s 68% corn 18% wheat and 14% malted barley finished in a sherry barrel. First there’s an assortment of wood from tree to toasted oak followed by roasted walnuts leather and marshmallow. Grapefruit rind and a bitterness appear followed by more woody notes and hints of vanilla. It never strikes the desired balance finishing short with a hint of hazelnut."
1647,5,"Named after the Charter Oak tree from the 1800s this brand offers decent value. Sweetness and grain come and go with hints of baking soda and dandelions. Think cooked grains in presentations like cornbread and fresh-baked rye bread. Unfortunately this is too much of a one-trick pony falling into those pronounced grains that don’t offer much more. But there’s no doubt about it: it’s worth the money. Remember value."
1648,9,"A generally sweet palate (a bit too sweet actually) with vanilla sweet corn caramel marzipan candied fruit and a suggestion of red and black licorice peppered with cinnamon. Slightly harsh on the finish. I wish there was more to balance all the sweetness. (Perhaps some extra aging for some additional dry oak spiciness?)"
1649,5,"With a mashbill of 70% corn 10% malted wheat 10% malted barley and 10% honey malted barley youth is evident as ripe grains and wood initially dominate. Pepper cherry and raw clover honey appear mid-palate over wheat bread and creamed corn. A surprisingly medium-to-long finish gives a hint of caramel suggesting more time in the barrel would create a better pour."
1650,11,"There's a medicinal darkroom aroma right up front and a dry graininess (with just a dusting of baker's chocolate) to the nose. It carries through in the mouth with a faintly chemical astringency that takes away from the underlying corn sweetness. Very hot finish. Water helps bring more sweetness out a bit but cuts some of the body out from under."
5553,9,"Very fragrant and floral with bright notes of citrus (lemons orange) and fresh grass. Similar on the palate with additional notes of soft honeyed malt and vanilla. Clean fresh appetizing finish. A nice aperitif or better yet a liquid sorbet between courses."
1651,9,"A new “upgrade” from the standard Old Crow which is only three years old. Soft aroma of sweet corn candy corn vanilla and light caramel all following through on the palate. It finishes sweet (too sweet actually) a bit grainy and slightly hot. If this brand is meant to compete with Evan Williams then this four year old should be the standard “Old Crow” and the Reserve expression should be more like five or six years old because the standard Evan Williams bottling (with no age statement) is clearly superior to Old Crow Reserve. Old Crow Reserve is too sweet and lacks the oak notes needed for balance and complexity. Acceptable enough as a mixing bourbon or perhaps on the rocks but I wouldn’t drink this neat or with water."
1652,5,"Freshly cut oak and chewing tobacco to start followed by hints of green apple wood chips and a warm wet sharpening stone. On the palate the wood heightens and becomes extremely bitter. This whiskey’s saving grace is that it’s extremely palatable in cocktails."
1653,9,"Its age certainly shows with a good dose of leather tobacco and barrel char. Sweet notes of caramel toffee and candied fruit try to rescue it but ultimately fails toward the finish leaving my mouth parched leathery and craving a glass of water (or a beer!). A bourbon with individuality but it pains me to think what this could have been (or once was)."
1654,5,"Up front it is extremely off-putting with overwhelming medicinal musk and anise notes but herbs candied fruit and shrubs offer a semblance of hope. Finally caramel and vanilla appear though short overtaken by raw sweet corn and oats. Grain doesn’t go away; it almost masks specks of brown sugar and citrus before a short finish with an unrelenting bitterness."
1655,9,""" Straight from them there oak cask barrels to this here bottle"" the label reads. Light gently sweet notes of vanilla and caramel corn are the core of this whiskey. Inter-dispersed notes of mint charred oak and candied fruit are also present. The label also states ""Sure enough smooth."" True I have had harsher whiskeys but I’ve also had many that were smoother -and within this price range. In fact there are several bourbon whiskeys on the market at this price that are at least this smooth and with a lot more flavor."
1656,9,"Perhaps my least favorite of all the Experimental Collection releases to date. The nose shows nicely but it comes across as rather aggressive and harsh on the palate toward the finish which the label describes as being “earthy.” Otherwise the whiskey is pleasantly sweet with molasses date and fig plus charcoal leather and bitter resin in the mix. Price is per 375 ml."
1657,9,"A big bourbon in many respects but this is one whiskey where I would have happily settled for a “Single Barreled.” I tasted this whiskey straight from the barrel right before it was bottled and it was more aggressive; I think the lower strength and chill-filtering has helped to tame this beast. To be honest there are some good qualities to this whiskey. The nose is wonderful! Even the palate starts out fine with chewy toffee molasses dark fruit raisins and dates. But it is quickly consumed by intensely dry oak spice gripping resin and leather which clings to my tongue and won’t let go. In this instance last impressions are lasting impressions. Price is per 375 ml."
1658,5,"Although it’s not on the label Cavalry uses the TerrePURE technology on 4 month old MGP whiskey. Its short time in wood shows. No traditional notes of bourbon sweetness not even an earthy hint of wood found in many younger bourbons. This is more reminiscent of a neutral grain spirit than bourbon but masked in the alcohol-centric flavor is a slight sweetness likely representing oak and a hint of grain. Sourced whiskey."
1659,3,"Monarch the 75th anniversary limited edition of Canada’s best-selling whisky raises the already high Crown Royal flavor bar. Zesty rye from an ancient Coffey still is the throbbing heart of this blend balancing cloves ginger cinnamon glowing hot pepper and that gorgeous sour bitterness of rye grain against crispy fresh-sawn lumber fragrant lilacs dark fruits and green apples. Butterscotch chocolate toffee mint pine needles and sweet pitchy balsam enrich a luscious creamy mouthfeel carefully tempered by grapefruit pith. Editor's Choice"
1660,3,"The Chronicles collection debuted two years ago with the release of the 40 year old. This the third annual release incorporates a smidgen of younger rye and a dash of brandy. The nose and palate are deep and complex. Fruity and floral on the nose with hints of raisin tarts apple skins and apricots. A sweet fruitiness with mild peppers baking spices and a crisp vaguely tannic backbone. Extended fruity glowing finish."
1661,3,"Remarkably flavorful with linen oilcloth dragon fruit hints of cereal dark fruits warm peppers creamy rye spices vague chocolate and coffee. Not overly sweet and just slightly floral. Viscous and creamy yet massive muscular and so beautifully complex balanced and integrated. (102 bottles; Canada exclusive) $225 CAD"
1662,9,"Perhaps the finest Canadian whisky I have ever tasted. Creamy and seamless from beginning to end. Gently sweet with orange creamsicle marzipan sultana praline maple syrup and a hint of coconut macaroon. Forty Creek whiskies have always been very good but none have ever had the right stuff to reach classic status. Until now that is. An outstanding very distinctive whisky!"
1663,3,"Recently a new “oldest Canadian whisky ever” appears every year. In 2018 the honor goes to Canadian Club. Cedar lumber fresh apricots hints of bonfire and sweet applewood on the nose. On the palate it’s butter tarts with vanilla waves of pepper pears peaches bonfire notes and hints of pipe tobacco. Crisp clean and slightly bigger than Canadian Club 40 year old the 41 is woodsy silky and mouth filling. (2472 bottles for U.S.)"
1664,3,"After 40 years in barrels the trademark Canadian Club dark fruit is as rich as ever. Reminiscent of raisin tarts with sprinkles of sweet baking spices then strawberries and black pepper. Warming but never hot. No tannins no woodiness; silky barrel tones are the only hint of oak while soaring floral esters speak loudly of time in the barrel. The glowing never-ending finish is spectacular. Canada’s Sesquicentennial Celebratory Release. C$250"
1665,3,"This 100% rye-grain whisky is distilled in Alberta then shipped to Sonoma California for final touches. Finished in new American oak batch PSA3 is one of the tastiest U.S. bottlings of Canadian rye ever. Soft caramels cushion ethereal honeysuckle blackened firewood and lusty rye spices on a framework of pulling oak tannins. Hugely complex with new rewards in every sip."
1666,3,"The third in the Chronicles series offers a slightly closed nose that soon shows high esters cinnamon and eggnog while hints of mint hide among old dry barn boards in a gorgeous creamy palate. Mild caramels fade into peppery heat restrained grassy herbs and pulling tannins. Burley tobacco leaves replace Canadian Club’s signature dark fruits. Finishes long hot and vaguely dry."
5554,9,"Gently sweet with toffee nougat and honey-glazed nuts balanced by bright citrus and sultana. A soothing unpretentious malt I would save for after dinner."
1668,9,"Creamy silky texture on the palate. Richer than the flagship Crown Royal but still quite clean on the palate. Along with creamy vanilla delicate fruit and floral notes you’ll also find caramel and butterscotch a peppering of spice (particularly cinnamon) and light nougat. Silky smooth finish. A benchmark whisky in the traditional Canadian style."
1669,3,"If Canada made bourbon (it doesn’t) it would taste like this massive dram. The mashbill of 60% corn 36% rye and 4% malted barley is identical to that used for Crown Royal Hand Selected Barrel Coffey rye. Beer still distillation and virgin oak barrels yield huge vanillas rye spices barrel tones cherries dark fruits soaring floral esters and gingery peppery spices. Strong woodiness slightly pulling tannins and something almost chocolaty."
1670,3,"Oh the glory of used cooperage. Woody notes begone—let time slowly breathe life into what began as almost neutral high-proof corn spirit. Creamy spice barley sugars peach syrup dry grasses and ancient barn boards. Incredible complexity yet so tightly interwoven it achieves oneness. One hundred points until a campfire bursts onto the finish and consumes five of them."
1671,3,"The first annual release of Sazerac’s finest old Canadian and American whiskies blended at barrel strength. The nose presents memories of long-closed whisky warehouses old books and artist’s oil paint. Prunes dates figs chocolate-covered cherries a cobbler’s shop vague cloves lilacs brown sugar and warming spices on the palate. Ultra-complex rich creamy and fruity. Hot and mouth-watering with billows of vanilla creamy caramel and mincemeat. (1200 bottles for the U.S. and Canada only) Collectible"
1672,3,"Teasing out the threads of this perfectly woven fabric takes time. And what an enjoyable time it is! Big whisky with no dominant notes but enticing suggestions of pine pitch butterscotch barley sugars freshwater plants sandalwood cream brisk peppery spices sweetish baking spices clean wood with vague tannins and gorgeous orange bitters late in the finish. Apricots hard peaches and echoes of raspberries throughout."
1673,3,"Corby’s latest Lot 40 this one undated comes from the same distillation batch as the 2012 release but with a couple of extra years in wood. The familiar flavors are all there: dustiness sour rye hard wet slate floral notes exotic fruits sweet spices and biting white pepper. Over these time has sprinkled licorice root dried dates oatmeal porridge vanilla hints of bike tires and mango peels. Flavors remain fully integrated with faint tannins underscoring a long sour-rye finish. Value Pick."
1674,3,"The first expression of the Crown Royal Noble Collection was our Canadian Whisky of the Year in 2016 and this one outdoes the original. This release features the standard Crown Royal Fine De Luxe finished in cabernet sauvignon barrels.  To an already complex blend of vanilla delicate flowers and fruits add canned peach syrup pears and white plums with smoldering pepper and grape skin tannins on the finish."
1675,3,"Distilled from 90% rye grain and 10% rye malt Lot No. 40 boldly mingles the galvanizing piquancy of distilled rye grain with the soaring floral fragrance of malted rye and a fruitiness born of age. It begins with hard dusty earthy rye and sour rye bread followed by a trio of baking spices: cloves nutmeg and blistering ginger. A farm-tinged sourness fades into citrus fruit with velvet tannins.

1676,3,"Cask strength Lot No. 40 has been in production at Hiram Walker Distillery for over 75 years for use as flavoring whisky. Finally in bottle this is more than regular Lot No. 40 amped up. New notes of halva pansies blistering spices tropical fruits minty candy canes and peanut skins are layered over the lilacs rye bread dark fruits and slatey rye of its 43% standard release. Long glowering finish."
1677,3,"Masterson’s bottles singular rye whisky. Yes this 100% rye-grain whisky is sourced but finishing by 3 Badge Beverage in French oak casks makes it their own. Booming gingery spices cavort on a creamy leathery almost oily palate. Snappy sour pickles and vague herbal notes contrast pointedly with sweet vanilla and hints of milk chocolate dried black fruit and aromatic pipe tobacco."
1678,3,"Vanilla honey and caramel accented by baking spices and dark fruits on a complex nose. Water opens up a blisteringly spicy palate revealing gorgeous clean grains dusty rye and citrus hints hidden underneath. Not as floral as earlier iterations and with fewer typical sour rye notes. Baking spices dominate the vanilla-sweet palate which finishes with sweet peppery spiciness. Perfect for cask-strength fanatics with patience and an eyedropper. C$100"
1679,3,"This has the classic sweetish oily floral leathery nose of 100% rye grain whisky. A luxurious creamy medium-weight dram with caraway rye bread restrained but hot peppery spices vague citrus notes and hints of cedar setting goal posts for punts of sweet and vaguely floral barley sugar nail polish (in a good way) caramel barrel wood well-aged lumber dark rye bread ripe apples milk chocolate and baking spices. $90 CAD"
1680,3,"The fourth in this series is finished in air-dried French oak. Hints of butterscotch become fruity with tinges of vanilla as the nose opens. A luxurious creamy palate develops peppery spices that dissolve into a sweet fruitiness with a glowing warmth in the back of the throat. A dynamic dram with lovely hot spices that advance then retreat. The long finish is mildly sweet and spicy. Editors’ Choice"
1681,3,"Bottled at natural cask strength and without an age statement this is clearly all-rye whisky with its lilacs cloves and baking spices. Strong hints of caraway point directly to rye yet suggestions of antiseptic black licorice and butterscotch take this iconic dram in new directions. A handful of vocal fans have demanded cask strength though this Lot 40 begs for water."
1682,3,"Pencil shavings then vanilla caramel barley sugar and bitter candied orange peel. Mild white pepper persists in a spicy fusion from which a subtle but energizing pithiness teases out delicate smatterings of cloves ginger and allspice. The fruitiness of canned peaches apricots and sour green apples adds dimension and balance. Complex and so tightly integrated that rich as it is individual flavors are little more than nuances. Finish is long and gingery with refreshing citrus pith. (Canada only) C$100"
1683,3,"This blend of eleven whiskies commemorates the eleven children William Gooderham adopted. Hints of cereal grain creamy mouthfeel blossoming caramel sweetness and an increasingly peppery glow with suggestions of sweetish ginger and clove. Black fruits: figs plums dates and prunes. Slowly develops pulling wood tannins. More components than mainstream Gooderham & Worts yet just as tightly integrated. (Canada exclusive) $100 CAD"
1684,3,"A quintessential Canadian whisky that holds fresh-cut lumber hot white pepper and creamy oak caramels in delicate balance. Long years in oak have delivered a range of complex flavors that evolve slowly in the glass and on the tongue. Sweet vanilla contrasts with dusty rye while a drop of pickle juice slowly matures into poached pears with cloves. Dry grain ripens into fresh-baked biscuits before it all fades away in clean oak and citrus pith. C$75"
1685,9,"Those of you who think Canadian whiskies are thin and bland should give this one a try. No it’s not a new concept like Forty Creek. It’s still very much a “traditional” Canadian. But when compared to most Canadian whiskies it’s richer creamier and velvety smooth. The flavors are straightforward — primarily vanilla with some crème brûlée toasted marshmallow tangerine peaches and cream and gentle rye spice — but they are clean and well-balanced. A delicious lighter-style whisky."
1686,3,"Distilled in May 2001 from a bourbon-style sour mash this whisky was intended for blending. However times change and Wiser’s recently vatted all 132 barrels as an Ontario exclusive. High esters sweet pitchy resins clean wood caramel barley sugar floral notes burley tobacco green grapes and Granny Smith apples. And that’s just the nose. Rich toffee vanilla brisk white pepper ripe black fruits. Lingering peppery caramel corn finish. (Canada only) C$65"
1687,3,"If you worried what would happen when Forty Creek ran out of Canadian oak barrels you will be pleased to know John Hall found more local oak trees and had new barrels made; this time in Canada. This tightly integrated dram is rich in woody maple syrup with raisins almonds and vanilla ice cream that softens a peppery glow. Silkier than the original slightly restrained and ever so quaffable. A longish pithy finish begs another sip. Still a classic. Editor's Choice."
1688,3,"Each fall whisky lovers in Canada and Texas anticipate John Hall’s new limited edition whisky. This year’s sits squarely in the golden heart of classic Canadian rye. Tingling gingery pepper is bathed in ultra-creamy butterscotch woody maple syrup black tea and barley sugar. Prune juice and ripe dark fruits dissolve into dried apricots and zesty hints of citrus. Then floral rye notes turn dusty with gentle wisps of willow smoke. Complex full-bodied and slowly evolving so let it breathe. C$70"
1689,3,"Cinnamon cloves ginger candy sweetness and strong bitter grapefruit pith overtake an initial dry dusty rye. After years in an assortment of bourbon barrels new wood is used to tame the rugged rye notes while adding complexity and breadth. The oak has left obvious traces behind with barrel notes and hints of fresh-cut firewood. Candied in the vein of Wiser’s Legacy but sharper harder and much crisper. Canada’s non-chill filtered reward for being Wiser’s biggest fan. (Canada only.) C$99"
1690,9,"Bottled to commemorate the 150th Anniversary of Canadian Club whisky. An amazingly fresh and vibrant whisky given its age and delicateness. I feared that given how light in body traditional Canadian whiskies are this whisky would be old tired and show too much oak (which was true for Crown Royal’s ultra-premium offering XR). But this isn’t the case. There’s an excellent balance of silky caramel vanilla icing dried spice (cinnamon spearmint) and berried fruit along with more subtle notes of toffee apple corn oil and soft dried oak on the finish. Not as luxurious as Crown Royal’s Cask No. 16 but it shines with its polish and purity."
1691,3,"Fifteen years ago Forty Creek used starboard (port-style wine) barrels to finish their legendary Portwood Reserve. The wine was emptied into fresh Forty Creek whisky barrels. Now master blender Bill Ashburn has added back some of that original starboard to Forty Creek Unity. This lush mouth-filling butterscotch-sweet whisky bursts with red fruits raisin tarts hints of burnt toffee and a restrained peppery glow."
1692,3,"A complex nose rich in aromas of fresh peaches wild beach roses prairie sage hints of rye spices and lumber. A sweet hot peppery palate bursts with rye spices high floral tones gummy bears then earthy herbal notes river plants and some pulling wood tannins Loaded with rye and apple juice. Fades slowly into herbal notes brown sugar and a hint of peach pits."
1693,3,"Stalk & Barrel cask strength 100% rye whisky takes rye into innovative new flavor territory. Rye spices rose water vanilla earthy tones and dark rye bread on first nosing are all typical of rye. However once it broadens into linen oilcloth linseed oil high fruity esters malt and breakfast cereal (Weetabix?) it’s all wonderfully original. A real honey barrel. Dang!"
1694,3,"So much wood so beautifully integrated into dry straw black fruits and tart pink grapefruit juice. Dry with a farmy earthiness and like the scotch hogsheads it was finished in bigger than life. Icing sugar red wine and floral perfume. WhistlePig was the original U.S.-bottled Canadian 100% flavoring rye and after 4 years flexing in Vermont its muscles are enormous."
1695,3,"Another Lock Stock & Barrel all rye-grain whisky from the pot still at Alberta Distillers. To the sweet oak caramels vanilla and potent spiciness of new charred American oak barrels it adds spring flowers blistering black pepper and blackstrap molasses. Firewood Smith Brothers black cough drops and new leather bring dimension to ever-present cloves and egg-noggy nutmeg. Canada balsam licorice cherries clean oak and the heat of high proof then a long hot sweet and spicy finish with vegetal undertones."
1696,3,"When Thomas Chen introduced Canadian Rockies in Taiwan he chose Highwood Distillers in High River Alberta to supply a delicate yet fragrant fruit-laden whisky that would please the Taiwanese palate. Now launching in Canada Chen upped the bottling strength to 46% to boost the flavor. The complex exotic fruit salad and faint lilac-like flowers that characterized the original remain along with blistering white pepper sweet oak caramels and crisp clean barrel notes on a luxurious creamy palate.

1697,12,"Made using koji during fermentation and finished in barrels seasoned with umeshu a plum liqueur. Earthy and a bit mysterious with sandalwood incense cedar smoke eucalyptus barrel char and sweet aromas of vanilla taffy key lime pie and lemon oil. There’s a lot of dry oak on the palate but it’s balanced with chewy herbs lapsang souchong tea pistachio orange peel milk chocolate fennel and peppery spice. The finish is long spiced and herbal with licorice mint eucalyptus and dry oak. Collectible"
1698,3,"Distilled from a mash of 90% rye matured in new and once-used barrels and masterfully blended to produce a bold spicy complex whisky with aromas of vanilla baking spices and butterscotch. Crown Royal’s classic minty piney palate melds gloriously with gingery heat and sweet clove oil cushioned by ripe cherries fruit cocktail and soft milk chocolate.

1699,3,"A fan favorite now in its 11th year the 2017 edition Heritage maintains the grain-forward fruity Forty Creek house style adding a buttery slipperiness honeycomb citrus peels kumquats marzipan and blazing rye spices. Nutty and oily but clean and spicy with a never-ending finish. (under 16500 bottles)"
1700,3,"Two-row barley grown on the distillery farm yields a glorious dram with berries instantly on the nose accompanying fragrant dry hay. The sweet fruitiness of the nose becomes clear overtones of wild Vancouver Island blackberries on the palate. This is big whisky with exotic fruits hot spices and nutty grainy marzipan notes. Restrained oak allows fruits and spices to shine. Slowly a lingering spicy finish turns sweet and fruity. 85 CAD"
1701,3,"This blend of rye barley corn and wheat whiskies starts big on the nose with caramel-donut glaze that dissolves into buckwheat honey then sweet orange marmalade. Spices are ever-present but restrained while a creamy sweet breadiness prevails throughout. Cereal notes on the palate are awash in honey sweetness. A soft yet tightly integrated whisky with depth and complexity. 100 CAD"
1702,3,"Master blender Bill Ashburn invited five Forty Creek fans to help him create this year’s special release. It is one of the tastiest new whiskies in recent years from Forty Creek. Rich luscious caramels grape jelly sultanas sweet red wine and hot rye spices with a round and velvety mouthfeel. Forty Creek’s annual releases are collectors’ favorites in Canada and the U.S. Some editions sell in the thousands of dollars and Unity seems poised to become one of these classics.

1703,3,"After blending 21 year old Canadian whisky was finished in French and Hungarian oak barrels for added zest. This brought hints of nutmeg and candied Christmas cake fruits to berries green fruits pineapple kiwi spearmint lush caramels exotic wood charred firewood applewood and lovely clean barrel notes. Glowing heat leather tobacco furniture polish and a creamy body. Beautifully complex peppery and balanced. (Canada exclusive) $100 CAD"
1704,3,"This truly outstanding Canadian whisky is sold exclusively in the U.S. The Crown Royal blending lab has so perfected the art of blending that each whisky becomes a seamless unit. Blenders’ Mash is a rare opportunity to taste a component of that unit. Distilled from 60% corn 36% rye and 4% malted barley then matured in new oak this whisky is massive and bourbon-like. It ages slowly in Canada’s cold winters for 13 years becoming very complex yet not too woody. Rather it is packed with creamy caramels vanilla gingery white pepper dark fruits floral tones and accenting barrel notes. Number 5 in the 2018 Top 20"
1705,3,"For six decades Alberta Premium has been one of Canada’s favorite economy-brand mixers. Floral herbal and fruity with charcoal and wet slate this new addition to the lineup is clearly meant for connoisseurs. While the original is made entirely from rye grain Dark Horse beefs up the flavor and body with a dollop of corn whisky and a sherry finish creating a vanilla-rich symphony of pepper hot ginger pickle juice and crisp clean oak. C$30"
1706,3,"A rich luxurious whisky finished in cognac casks as was the crisper brighter Cask No. 16 that it replaces. This is the cedary leathery tobacco-ish sipping whisky of the private club. Simple toffee and the cherry essence of Beaujolais nouveau evolve into ripe red apples and heavy dusky dark fruit with candied citrus peel bitter almond skins and hints of oak. Sizzling gingery spice and white pepper linger over textured sandalwood. Defined by its heavy creamy body."
1707,3,"A complex nose with citrus fruits hints of sultanas barrel tones mild vanilla butterscotch and manuka honey. The sweetish palate is rich in stone fruits—peaches and apricots that merge into a vaguely pithy nuttiness then dried Mediterranean fruits: dates and figs. Classic slippery corn sweetness complements hot sweet rye spices. Ends in a medium vaguely oaky smoky finish."
1708,3,"A captivating nose presents hints of polished leather shoes and clean oak. Less sweet than expected Entrapment goes straight to long-evolved high esters dried figs and dates green fruits and soaring fruity floral notes. Its spicy finish lasts forever. This very complex and tightly integrated whisky has all the woody acetone-like glories of long-aged scotches. Then finally some barley sugar but only after sitting long in the glass."
1709,3,"Fifty years on the standard Canadian Club becomes very complex and in-your-face delicious. Barley sugar sweetness blossoms into creamy caramel in a dark heavy full-bodied whisky with cinnamon hot chewing tobacco and sizzling spice. Acetone dry wood and peaches on the nose give way to musty perfumed sandalwood and fresh crisp oak with glowing embers in the throat. Floral sweet and a bit nutty it finishes slowly in leather and furniture polish. (Australia only) A$164"
1710,3,"A distillery exclusive until now Ninety Nine Proof is finally in distribution across the U.S. One hundred days finishing in Gretzky’s own cabernet sauvignon barrels put wagonloads of ripe fruit on the nose with some dry hardwood peanut brittle and a slight tickle too. This is powerful whisky quite fruity with long fading dry pepper and an inviting hint of spent gunpowder leading to a dry slightly woody finish."
1711,3,"This final reprise of one of Forty Creek’s original whiskies is one juicy succulent
dram. Fruity hints of red grapes on the nose mingle with sherry-sweetened pipe
tobacco and herbal earthiness. Sizzling peppers bolster a palate rich in nutty waxy
barley soft oily corn and dry dusty rye. Suggestions of halva and citrus zest lead into
a long briskly spicy herbal finish."
1712,3,"Sweet lush and creamy with hints of banana cream pie maple syrup and mild vanilla then spicy hard candy new barrels and a wealth of creamy fruity aromas tightly integrated. Caramely cough drops melt into sweet baking spices. The mouthfeel stays creamy as hot spices emerge. Complex balanced and very quaffable. The long finish is sweet with peppers and cereal notes. Bottle numbers correspond to individual weeks since Confederation. Canada’s Sesquicentennial Celebratory Release. C$50"
1713,3,"The feedback loop is short when the guys who make the whisky also pour it for consumers. This “tweaked” version of Red Label blends home-distilled corn rye and single malt whiskies with a sourced base. Tweaking the proportions yields a brighter bolder and crisper whisky than the original with soaring esters fragrant flowers succulent vanillas and brisk spices."
1714,3,"Strong barrel tones on the nose enhanced by mint bread-and-butter pickles and prunes. A floral palate is hot slippery and quite sweet with restrained barrel tones roses mild menthol sweet rummy molasses and brilliant peppery spices in the middle. Later sips show slightly sour orange juice. Finishes with hot spices and vaguely bitter pith. $65 CAD"
1715,3,"A blend of 95% rye-grain flavoring whisky with a variety of base whiskies. Its big whisky cocktails will tempt mixers into sipping. Very fruity and floral with prunes peaches red apple skins and bouquets of spring flowers all boosted by vibrant peppery spices on a slightly oaky base. Crown Royal’s signature balsam resin note and hints of vanilla round it out. The long spicy finish ends with hints of citrus pith. A complex tightly woven blend. (U.S. only)"
1716,3,"Tucked away in the small Alberta town of High River Highwood distillers has made large volumes of Canadian whisky and dozens of other distilled beverages since 1974. Undaunted by recent flooding and with more than three decades of aging whisky on hand the owners recently decided to emphasize premium whiskies. Ninety the latest of these is simply gorgeous. Crispy clean oak dark fruit butterscotch
corncobs and nutmeg precede candy cane sour fruits cinnamon ginger and citrus pith. (Canada only) C$48"
1717,3,"Corn and rye whiskies blended with a tad of Villard Noir Starboard wine commemorate Canada’s victory in a battle fought in the War of 1812 where Forty Creek now distills whisky. Toasted oak staves were inserted into half of the fully matured whisky for 2 months. A strong maple nose dissolves into hints of fruitiness while a sweet palate balances and restrains drying tannins. Fruity creamy and mouth-filling with peppery spices. (600 bottles for U.S.)"
1718,3,"Tempting vanilla custard with swirls of orange marmalade and just-burnt toffee. Icing sugar red cedar and oak with pithy tannins and sizzling spices: pepper hot cinnamon and ginger. Then a fruitiness unfolds into crisp Granny Smith apples and chewy jujubes. Gradually the layers peel back revealing delicate hints of buttered popcorn mealy marzipan candy cane and burley tobacco. The subtle earthiness of cooked corncobs complements sour fruits and sweet spices. Huge complex and beautifully balanced. (Canada only)  C$50"
1719,3,"A few years ago Alberta’s Highwood distillers purchased all the remaining stock from Potter’s whisky brokerage just over the Rocky Mountains in Kelowna. With it Highwood skillfully created a sumptuous limited-edition bottling that is as sweet smooth and creamy as French vanilla ice cream and richer in fresh clean wood than a carpentry shop. Dried cloves and red cedar balance real maple syrup and butterscotch which in turn dissolve into sweet white grapefruit. (Alberta only) C$52"
1720,3,"Winemakers have long known that toasted oak is very spicy. Today’s whisky makers are slowly catching on. Cinnamon hearts and hot peppermint add zing to a rich and creamy mouthfeel. Although the whisky is not overly sweet it has a candied feel. Cloves and hot pepper round out the spices while vanilla and butterscotch lend smoothness as they keep earthy flinty rye notes under control. Essences of cedar cigar box and black withered figs contribute additional complexity. C$50"
1721,3,"Inspired by Crown Royal Monarch Crown Royal is introducing a new line of equally remarkable whiskies called the Noble Collection. This “Cornerstone Blend” begins the series. Rye-grain whisky fresh-cut lumber and new oak. Sweet with a broad spiciness rich heady nose floral overtones and fruity esters. Vague milk chocolate tropical fruit and ripe bananas soften the peppery spices. Powerful yet elegant. Complex and tightly synthesized into a single well balanced whole."
1722,3,"Finished in wet freshly dumped bourbon barrels Double Barrel shows strong bourbonesque vanilla and a slippery almost syrupy lushness. This latest batch is even creamier than the early ones made by John Hall himself. After a deceptively simple start a mouth-filling toffee sweetness broadens into ripe tropical fruits with fleeting under-notes reminiscent of earthy dragonfruit. Hot peppery flares punctuate the soft fruitiness as it moves to the fore and the creamy mouthfeel subsides."
1723,3,"Three Grain Harmony marries rye and barley whiskies from 1992-94 to 4 year old corn whisky. The corn lends voluptuous body to a complex assortment of carefully integrated grains dark fruits prune juice and butterscotch. Dried herbs potpourri and orange peel follow as the palate begins to broaden. When the big notes fade look for delicate subtleties. Hot spices and pepper build from sip to sip and linger long into the sandalwood finish."
1724,3,"Although this whisky was distilled at CC’s sister plant in Alberta the dried dark fruit signature of Canadian Club is evident as soon as you open the cap. Elegant but never subdued; cloves nutmeg and allspice play off the fruit and underlying notes of clean grain dust. Vanilla and rich woody tones indicate at least some virgin oak barrels were used for its 7 year maturation. Rich caramels soften a gently glowing heat. Complex and beautifully balanced. (Canada only) Value Pick."
1725,3,"Before a regulation required British Columbia distillers to source their ingredients within the province Shelter Point bought some 100% rye spirit from Alberta Distillers. Nine years later it has developed flavors of halvah and honey which caress blue clay turning it sweet floral and fruity then hot and spicy with cloves rose water and more rye spices. Clean and crisp with deep complexity it sizzles on the tongue ending in hints of grain. (Canada only-CAD$125)"
1726,3,"Vague fruitiness barrel notes and corncobs on the nose turn to lush caramels with a plush mouthfeel punctuated by hints of rye spices that become more assertive as notes of cloves meld into candy cane on a long spicy then pithy finish. There is more fruit in this special Canada 150 edition of Confederation Oak—sweet ripe apples and tart gooseberries. A masterful example of blending."
1727,11,"Vanilla and oak nose with a creamy layer of mint that warns you: Rye Ahead. And what a sweet rye wave it is rolling in with green mint and grass more bourbony oak and vanilla lively spice on the top (with enough heat to keep it bold) and a finish that brings everything together. Beautifully integrated and not overly woody a tribute to the blending art of Canadian distillers."
1728,3,"Hail the new distillers who have so broadened the profile of rye whisky. All rye grain some matured in new American and Canadian oak and some in bourbon barrels yields a complex palate woven into sweet citrus reminiscent of Grand Marnier. Fresh linen with the waxiness of a wet oil painting tart gooseberries creamy vanilla caramels nutty cereals and peppery spices. Finishes sweet with ripe fruit white pepper and halva."
1729,3,"Insights developed from four generations making fine California wine are applied brilliantly to Masterson’s 100% rye-grain whisky. Finishing in Hungarian oak barrels lends softness to warm glowing spices ripe Bing cherries Granny Smith apples and cocoa powder. Sandalwood follows then Humbugs farmy notes sweet grainy beer mash fragrant esters and candy canes on a slippery palate. Long spicy vanilla finish."
1730,3,"Rum barrels replace port wood in a reformulated Pike Creek. The sweetness of the rum finish accommodates higher proof and an extra 5% shot of rye making this Pike Creek slightly fatter than the original. Crisp clean wood sweet earthy fruitiness brisk peppers lovely tongue-tingling clove-like glow cigarette tobacco salt water taffy raisins dark plums and tart fruit."
1731,3,"Begins light on the nose with clean grain then spring flowers and persistent strong blackberry notes move in. Wonderfully balanced even as blackberries remain strong across the palate accented by tart kiwi fruit and rich spices: ginger cloves nutmeg. Fruits and spices complement each other as the round creamy palate fades into a long hot peppery finish. Beautiful whisky exclusive to the U.S. and fruitier than the 43.4% Canadian version. Best Value"
1732,3,"Aromas of old books ether raspberries and caramel with some sharpness and muddiness. Sweet and malty with maraschino cherries it then develops a hot and vaguely bitter-sweetness some dry barrel notes mild spices bananas and shoe polish. The finish is slightly sweet and mildly fruity with a fleeting bitterness some barrel notes and pleasant burning peppery spice. Not as lush as past releases or as tightly integrated. $90 CAD"
1733,3,"Each batch is a little bit different this one leaning to sweet orchard fruits nutty barley and hot spicy rye. Butterscotch and vanilla on the nose translate well onto the palate. Brisk peppery spice underlies developing layers adding another dimension of complexity to an already broad range of flavors. Hints of oak tannins on the finish remind us this was finished in Canadian wood."
1734,3,"Very aromatic with fruit leather red fruit mild caramel hints of oak and slight nose prickle. A lush sweet fruity palate restrained by peach pits earthy tones and mild oakiness develops hints of spent shotgun shells that could sometimes be found in very old sherried malts. A pleasing glow turns hot and peppery before gradually fading into unusually enjoyable rich red grape skins. Long complex and well-balanced."
1735,3,"A symphony of delicate exotic fruits in light syrup. The silky mouthfeel bolsters flourishes of sourish kumquats and tangerines while a delicate oaky foundation supports bursts of hot peppery spices. Sweet Christmas spices harmonize gently with creamy vanilla. Persimmon mild pears sweet lemon sandalwood and hints of incense each take their turn. The sweet citrus finish is a fitting finale to a subtle yet complex and seamlessly integrated dram that carefully balances heat with fruit. (Taiwan only) NT$2500"
1736,3,"A medley of well-integrated bright flavors including acetone green apples soft floral perfume vague tannins sweet pipe tobacco brown sugar hints of spar varnish fresh-cut wood vanilla galore soft well-integrated spices and subdued white pepper. It feels like corn syrup with hot spices on the sides of the tongue and hints of oak lumber throughout. Rich and full yet light fresh and estery. Long lingering hot spices on a sweet slightly fruity finish. Ends on cinnamon bark. (U.S. only)"
1737,11,"More Canadian core rye from WhistlePig this time at full-bore. It’s strong with rye sweet with melon and dark chocolate notes but with a wood character like the unfinished inside of an antique oak wardrobe. The antique wood is strong in the mouth an oddly elegant note but afterward comes the melon and chocolate and oily coiling rye. Interestingly complicated; a bit hard to make friends but worth the time and effort."
1738,3,"This long-aged blend of all-rye and all-corn whiskies celebrates J.P. Wiser’s belief that great whisky can’t be rushed. A dry nose with rye spices and overripe pears is quite complex. The palate sweet and somewhat drying suddenly shows strong ripe cherry notes then pipe tobacco cigar box lingering heat medium weight gorgeous woody notes and strong peppery spices. Hints of rye spices punctuate a long hot and fruity finish. 150 CAD"
1739,3,"Until recently Crown Royal Canada’s best-selling whisky took a conservative approach to limited-edition releases. The annual Noble Collection is a promising taste of the innovation underway at the Gimli Manitoba distillery which includes experiments with single grain wheat whisky single malts and more. This first venture into cask finishing uses Cabernet Sauvignon barrels. It is still Crown Royal but on top of the bourbonesque vanillas and woody notes rich red fruits jump from the glass. A new direction that moves Crown Royal into the realm of big beautiful whiskies. Number 18 in the 2017 Top 20"
1740,3,"A delicate dusting of exotic fruits and fragrant flower blossoms tailors this otherwise robust all-corn whisky to the Asian palate. Long development in the glass and in the mouth is typical of whisky that has spent many years in once-used barrels. East meets west as mellow oak caramels pithy dragonfruit and sour-sweet passion fruit temper fresh-cut red cedar fragrant lilacs bitter-sweet citrus fruit and scorching white pepper. Rich and mouth coating it fades slowly to sweetness. (Taiwan only) T$2035"
1741,3,"Opinion is seriously divided on whether this or an earlier Port Wood edition is the best thing ever to come from John K. Hall’s Forty Creek distillery in Grimsby Ontario. A winemaker Hall used his own port barrels to finish a mature blend of barley corn and rye whiskies. Stewed prunes butterscotch and licorice rule the nose while the palate broadens into savory herbs spiced fruit sweet pipe tobacco and hints of yes gunpowder. C$70"
1742,3,"A rich full nose interweaves red wine canned pears smidgens of barrel wood and dark maple syrup into a plush Christmas cake palate. Weighty and mouth-filling amid unsweetened breakfast cereal and mild tannins balanced by candied fruit prunes crisp apples and dried pears and apricots. Glowing peppery heat moves to the middle of the tongue before a long spicy and pithy yet creamy finish."
1743,3,"What a shame this whisky will sail to Taiwan with nary a bottle left for North America. It would be the oldest and most expensive Canadian whisky on the continent. And bottled at 50% one of the strongest. Wood age toffee cooked sweet corn fruit and slightly dusty new jeans. Gloriously sweet showing its ABV in a blistering pepper attack that subsides into sweetness and a mild fruitiness. (Taiwan only) NT$19800"
1744,3,"Matured in bone-dry Alberta where the angels quenched their thirst with water not alcohol and the strength steadily climbed over the 35 years spent in wood. Butterscotch but no inkling of spirit yet blistering heat on the palate. Surprisingly smooth though your tongue simply glows. Water adds complexity: dry grain fresh denim dust peaches green apples sweet woodiness and a long blazing finish. Pretty spectacular. (Taiwan only) NT$22310"
1745,3,"Sometimes when whisky is batched a few leftover barrels are returned to the warehouse. Canadian Club recently pulled and vatted several of these from the 1970s. Acetone Granny Smith apples and fresh-cut white cedar showcase this long age. Complex and spicy yet reserved this dram is ripe with strawberries canned pears cloves pepper and faint flowers then slightly pulling oak tannins. Distinct elegant and remarkably vibrant this ancient Canadian Club is anything but tired. (Australia only) A$133"
1746,9,"Similar to the standard Forty Creek Barrel Select whiskymaker John Hall produces three different whiskies (rye corn and malted barley) ages them separately and then marries them for a period before bottling. Unlike the Barrel Select with Double Barrel Reserve the resultant whisky is married in first-fill bourbon barrels rather than sherry casks. The result is a rich vanilla creaminess that coats the palate. Mixed in you’ll find coconut marshmallow citrus and pineapple with emerging toasted pecan dried spice and dusty corn on the finish. Quite soothing and dangerously drinkable. My favorite so far from the various Forty Creek releases."
1747,3,"Straight 100% unmalted barley whiskey. This must be a first in modern times. The huge nose gushes unusual aromas of fresh-turned earth wet corn cobs sour green apples anise cilantro and dill. An herbal nose becomes an herbal palate bathed in soft crème brûlée and hot peppery spices. Earthy notes turn pleasantly musty like damp straw. Finishes long on Scottish porridge. Like all Masterson’s this barley whiskey is from Alberta Distillers. And yes Canadian whiskey with an “e.”"
5555,9,"Generally sweet notes of honeyed fruit orange marmalade dark chocolate and salt water taffy. Soft gently briny finish. Pleasing enough of a whisky -- with no miscues -- but missing the depth found in some of the older bottlings. (Bottled for Texas)"
1748,3,"Innovation is key at Windsor’s Corby Distillers. Though best known for its Wiser’s range Corby also makes this juicy new four-grain beauty. Big and firm on the palate G&W glides into a buttery corn-whisky slather flooded with delicate rye flowers nutty dusty barley and soft sweet wheat notes. Want the list? Crisp clean oak citrus pith stewed fruits meadow flowers and brisk pepper with mildly pulling tannins. (Canada only) C$45"
1749,3,"Crown Royal develops its bourbon-like house style by using an American-style mashbill of 64% corn 31.5% rye and 4.5% malted barley for one of its many component whiskies. From this single component blender Mark Balkenende selected mature whisky exhibiting sweet flowers pear juice vanilla fresh grain mild barrel tones clean dry wood brisk spices and a long glowing finish. Very floral fruity and quaffable. ($55CAD; Ontario only)"
1750,3,"A year in brandy casks brings maple syrup Fig Newtons red grapes and graham
crackers to a nose teeming with rye spices dry fruits and roses. The juicy Christmas
pudding palate turns hot and oily with sweet butterscotch balancing bitter chocolate.
Pipe tobacco and oak tannins speak to maturity. As the long sweet finish fades a
warming glow and lingering barrel tones move to the fore. $120 CAD"
1751,3,"The standard Gooderham & Worts blends corn wheat barley and rye whiskies. This special edition forgoes the barley but not the flavor. A lovely hard toffee start slides into a wealth of cereal notes: barley sugars Cream of Wheat and oatmeal. Lovely soft caramels send a smooth sweetness gliding over the palate. Little Trinity exemplifies luxurious mouthfeel as much as it does breadth of flavor."
1752,2,"From Rochester New York-based Cask & Crew this was distilled in Canada matured 4 years in new charred oak then finished in another new charred oak barrel. Spice pistachio and a note of barrel char on the nose and a nutty creamy palate with notes of blueberry pie chocolate cooked plums and light spice. The finish offers more spice coffee cake and almond nuttiness. The profile is young but full of good flavors."
1753,3,"Vancouver Island grain farmer Patrick Evans built Shelter Point distillery in Oyster River on one of the last remaining seaside farms in British Columbia. Distiller James Marinus has been crafting traditional single malt whisky there since 2011. Barley sugar and a sweet waxiness lead into ripe red fruits and soft peachy sweetness with mild spices and hints of mealy halva. Malty and mature well beyond its years rising peppery notes introduce a long sweet grassy finish. Nicely balanced. C$70"
1754,3,"As time goes by Still Waters is developing a recognizable house style. Acetone fruit esters and floral notes on the nose with lemon biscuits and a hint of graham crackers. Hot sweet and lively on the palate with blistering spices soon cooled to sweet dark licorice. Hints of Cheerios and roasted grain are Still Waters’ signatures as this all-rye whisky shows. Clean dry grass pears and sweet barley sugar on a medium finish."
1755,3,"Canada’s Yukon Territory with its wolves bears and numbing cold does not evoke images of fine single malts. Nosing the dark fruit and malty goodness of Two Brewers whiskies corrects that misconception. Complex tobacco sweet dark chocolate red wine and halva become vaguely tannic barrel tones and searing spices cushioned in sweet canned fruit and cream. Malt melds into Band-Aid and dry grain. Artfully balanced complexity. $98 CAD"
1756,3,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year Glenora distillery has certainly hit its stride. This clean grassy 21 year old tastes like nothing so much as a top Speyside scotch. Fresh hay notes and a slightly effervescent spiciness give the feel but not the taste of hot black licorice. Barrel notes begin to show in the middle resolving into a long peppery pithy finish. Barrel selected by Mike Brisebois for Casker’s whisky club. Good stuff Glenora! (Distillery only)"
1757,3,"Recently Crown Royal began bottling some of the 50-odd whiskies in its core blend. Hand Selected Barrel and Northern Harvest Rye each peeked behind the blenders’ curtain. Now Blenders’ Mash (originally called Bourbon Mash) unveils the woody vanilla signature of Canada’s bestseller. This approachable creamy medium-bodied whisky bathes in sweet vanilla and mild oak tannins seasoned with peppery spices and fruity-floral esters. Incredibly long creamy vanilla finish."
1758,3,"Every now and then Canadian Club dips into its massive reserves to release a longer-aged version of its core 1858 edition. After an initial hit of toffee a well-defined woody framework supports signature Canadian Club pruney notes clean grain and peppery rye. Brown sugar unsweetened cereal and hints of barn boards in the middle follow an inviting crispness enhanced by mild oak tannins and accented by floral top notes. (Canada only) $60 CAD"
1759,9,"Created by distiller John Hall to celebrate his fifteen years of making whisky. It really is a whisky that defies categorizing. More body than most Canadian whiskies; softer and less aggressive than bourbon. When compared to Forty Creek Barrel Select (John’s standard whisky) it’s richer more velvety and sweeter on the nose and palate. Notes of toffee silky caramel mixed nuts exotic spice and a hint of marmalade. A soothing almost rummy very drinkable whisky."
1760,3,"Sweet citrus fruits floral overtones and assertive peppery spices interlace a generous framework of silky oak tannins. Charred oak and pencil shavings hint at new oak while the frosty crispness of dry autumn leaves confirms that at least some of this whisky has spent decades in reused barrels. Touches of almond skins and peach pits cleanse the late palate. Otherwise regal and elegant this whisky is just a touch woody.  C$30"
1761,2,"The nose is minty and herbal with a fragrant note of potpourri. It’s powerful on the palate with honey coconut shavings vanilla frosting and spice. Lots of robust age on this one with a finish that offers almonds dark chocolate vanilla cream oak char and good length. The barrel influence is strong as would be expected from a whisky of this age but is restrained enough to let the flavors emerge."
1762,3,"Fruit grape skins high esters and oiliness on the nose yield to sweet fruits on the palate with mild white pepper broadening into a warm spicy glow. The softness of barley sugar lends a creaminess to this mouth-filling middle-aged gem before it resolves in a long spicy finish with baking spices and slightly pulling barrel tones. A Canadian classic."
1763,3,"The nose is focused on cereal hints of fresh ripe cherries cooked fruit salad herbs and overt bourbon-like charcoal. Take a sip though and big beautiful tones of real peat reek rush to the fore on the palate. These are sustained by sweet barley sugar candied fruit dry cereal and a lush mouthfeel. The smoke incidentally comes from a few drops of real scotch added at blending. Very moreish. (British Columbia exclusive) $65 CAD"
1764,3,"WhistlePig does nothing by half measures. They had massive oak trees culled from their Vermont property coopered into heavily-charred barrels then used them to finish batches of already mature 100% rye. Layer on layer of soft vanilla old lumber cinnamon fresh orange peels baking spice dark fruits and medicinal hints of resin. Peppery hot and oakily sweet. A slight dustiness and a big juicy butterscotch kiss."
1765,3,"A new direction for Forty Creek’s 8th annual release which was aged 3 years redistilled then aged another 9 years. Quintessentially Canadian it begins with Caramac candy bar finishing in white pepper and bitter grapefruit pith. Not as lush as past releases although the flavors remain a tightly woven panoply of fruit spices vegetal notes and citrus zest. Gooseberries and lime on the nose become black currants on the palate as increasing hints of red wine come to dominate."
1766,3,"Wayne Gretzky’s distillery makes serious whisky. A large copper Vendome column and a Heriot-Watt graduate distiller make for some pretty fine spirit that will eventually fill Gretzky bottles. Sourced for now this rich round and creamy whisky is finished in ice wine casks from Gretzky’s vineyards. Cinnamon-tinged ripe red apples and kiwifruit in sultana syrup with baking spices and hot white pepper fading into mild barrel notes."
1767,3,"This gem from Forty Creek revives the tradition of adding herbs to whisky. Subdued
toffee on the nose rolls into a general earthiness followed by prune juice and gentle
spirit. The palate immediately shows white pepper with sweet soothing caramels
behind finishing in a long vaguely woody herbal essence. Added herbs subtly
enhance the whisky flavors rather than offering their own. If ever a whisky sparkled
this is it. $35 CAD"
1768,3,"This masterpiece of wine finishing yields a massive fruity nose with rich maple
toffee greyed cedar barrel wood and baseball glove. A sweet very fruity complex
palate features black pepper cinnamon hearts bristling spices slightly bitter pulling
tannins red wine figs and sandalwood. A longish finish shows grape tannins
grapefruit pith and red wine over maple notes and tingling spices. $70 CAD"
1769,3,"Lots of complexity follows the Canadian triad of caramel pepper and cleansing pith. Master blender Andres Faustinelli sourced 7 year old whisky in Okanagan red wine barrels then finished it in virgin air-dried 4 year old Hungarian oak. Rich oak and red wine on the nose lead to exotic spices tingling peppers burley tobacco and vaguely phenolic grape skins on a buttery palate. Burnt sugar and chocolate cherries then a long spicy finish."
1770,3,"Amping up the original Blue has pushed this blend of own-distilled flavoring and sourced base whiskies deep into sipping territory. Crème brûlée and a soft vanilla nose become Werther’s caramels until Still Waters’ signature rye spices and white pepper take charge. Add water and it blooms like a flower dampening the spices and leaving a round creamy chocolate-like mouthfeel."
1771,3,"With NAS 12 and 18 year old versions long-established as Canadian favorites Gibson’s master blender Brian Kinsman (of Glenfiddich) turned his hand to an 8 year old specifically intended to be mixed with Coke. Why? That’s how 40% of Canadians prefer their whisky. Rich in dark rum notes kola nuts vanilla pods and sweet rye it bursts with ripe black fruits and sizzling hot spices. Sip slowly to uncover black licorice a touch of tannin and the classic Canadian hot bitter pith finish. C$29"
1772,11,"A nose of hot cereal with a dusting of dry cocoa and oaky vanilla and hints of figs and sesame oil. The palate yields clean grains — a real crack of rye among them — and oak dried apricot unsweetened licorice and a long finish of warming rich cereal. Strikingly clean and non-cloying for Canadian sweet but not overdone. Good for mixing but equally good for sipping; a nice end-of-day dram. (Sold as both Very Old and 18 Year Old.)"
1773,3,"In 2013 the cavernous warehouses of the Canadian Mist distillery in Collingwood Ontario gave up a single fifty-barrel batch of 100% malted rye. It had been resting there since 1991. Sweet with the familiar flavors of rye bread a juicy joyful thrum burbles to a silken smooth surface before diving deep again only to rebound with warming spices white pepper and a pithy citrus pull. Indulgently creamy Collingwood 21 defines “smooth.” Rich flavorful and oh so mellow."
1774,3,"The trend to higher-proof Canadian whisky continues. This massive gem from Highwood shows us how that benefits the whisky drinker. Toffee and spicy rye on the nose become toffee and sizzling hot pepper on the palate. While toffee lurks in the shadows a lingering oaky base begins to assert itself. Sweetness and pepper subside as the wood emerges with a complexity not even hinted at on the nose. Enjoy it neat; love it with ginger ale. (Canada only)"
1775,3,"In 2009 brewers Bob Baxter and Alan Hansen added a stillhouse to their Whitehorse-based Yukon Brewing Company. This 7 year old their seventh whisky was distilled from Scottish peated malt creating a smoky malty scotch-like nose. Ripe apples apricots and other sweet fruits subdue the smoke until the first sip when it bursts to the fore with a sweet ashy presence. Smoke and pleasing hot pepper dominate a long finish. (Canada only) $100 CAD"
1776,9,"Light and easy drinking. Very clean on the palate with notes of creamy vanilla subtle fruit and delicate floral notes. Light clean finish. When I think of Canadian whisky this is the whisky that comes to mind."
1777,9,"Consisting of whiskies aged between 6 to 10 years with a similar grain component as a bourbon (but distilled differently) and finished in sherry casks for six months. Barrel Select is a soft silky somewhat feminine whiskey when compared to bourbon with gently sweet notes of creamy vanilla honeyed apricot toasted nuts and gentle background tropical fruit and spice. A whisky that really transcends category and definition."
1778,13,"There is a pronounced graininess up front with toasted coconut brioche bun and cereal box on the nose. Add water and toasted nuts brown sugar and pastry case aromas emerge. Take a sip and there’s a rich interplay of mint and chocolate Andes mints along with some herb and spice notes lemon curd and candied nuts. The finish is sweet spicy and slightly minty. There’s an in-your-face boldness to this whisky—one that reveals complexity over time."
1779,3,"Joining the core Pendleton lineup with a new edition expected each September. Past releases of Director’s Reserve have been irregular perhaps because a local rancher killed the buzz when he bought the entire first batch nearly a decade ago. A luxuriously creamy body coats your palate with mild vanilla butterscotch restrained white pepper and nutty plum pudding. Pencil shavings punctuate a medium finish. Less complexity than its age predicts."
1780,3,"This soft fruity luxury is a stablemate to Corby’s Lot No. 40 and another resurrected member of the once-lost Canadian Whisky Guild. Hiram Walker’s distillery where Pike Creek is made is one of the largest in North America. However the owner Pernod-Ricard encourages creativity and innovation as well as product reliability. Gingery dark fruits mingle with canned fruit and clean oak while a peppery nuttiness lingers below soft red wine and white grapefruit. C$40"
1781,12,"Dessert is served. Blueberries and raspberries baked into a sweet pie crust with pistachio spiced almonds and marzipan on the nose. The palate has gentle spice and a heft of deeper flavors—caramel semi-sweet chocolate candied berries and almonds and orange gummy wedges—balanced by vanilla and coconut. Though light it finishes with a satisfying richness of berry candy and polished oak. (Total Wine & More)"
1782,3,"From rye grown in a single Alberta field cultivated and harvested using horse-drawn farm machinery this whisky was aged in new American oak then finished in the distillery’s single malt barrels. The nose is dry clean and herbal: slatey with hints of cereal. Quite sweet on the palate with peaches berries kiwi and exotic fruits. Warming and spicy smoky but not hot with hints of pancake syrup. Finishes long silky and slippery. $73 CAD"
1783,3,"Dry and mildly dusty on first nosing with a touch of pine pitch and red cedar. Tingling peppery spices and barrel notes carry onto the palate bringing a slightly bitter counterpoint to luscious crème brûlée. Vanilla and hints of real maple syrup nuance apple pie sprinkled with baking spices ripe black fruits and a toffeeish but clean finish. Complex and beautifully integrated. Labeled 12 years old Onyx includes some older whisky as well. (Europe exclusive) €27"
1784,3,"John Hall’s tenth annual release blends 4 to 9 year old single grain barley corn and rye whiskies from a mix of barrels. Sweet and sour fruits prunes and grassy green grapes all inside a barrel warehouse yield a complex nose. Pears violets barley sugar vanilla fudge and hot pepper fade slowly into barrel tones and gentle bitter pith. A slightly slippery palate grows hot and spicy in the middle. Not as lush as past releases but equally as complex. $75 CAD"
1785,7,"A single barrel release selected by Julio’s Loch & K(e)y society focused very much on wood. An oak-forward nose features old split wood pencil lead and rye spice. On the palate the balance with oak improves slightly from the addition of brown sugar vanilla and cherry. Oak intensifies in the mid-palate keeping some semblance of balance with the sweet undertones but oak is clearly the star. A dry oak finish is the exclamation point at the end of this riff on wood. Sourced whiskey. (Julio’s Liquors only)"
1786,3,"Master blender Andres Faustinelli began with 7 year old Canadian whisky which he finished first in tight-grained French oak wine barrels and then in air-dried virgin Hungarian oak. This wonderfully mouth-filling fairly complex dram begins dry and closed developing caramel char exotic woods and spices berries red grapes luscious red wine glowing heat pulling tannins and sandalwood with butterscotch-like vanillas luscious dry fruits and a rich rye-like spicy texture."
1787,3,"Although grain changes every year due to the weather the flavor of Crown Royal Deluxe remains consistent. The skilled blenders who make this entry-level Crown Royal use their finely tuned noses not a recipe to ensure this. Wood orchard fruits floral tones and gallons of vanilla on the nose translate into butterscotch peppery rye spices and creamy vanilla fudge on the palate."
1788,3,"Taken slow and easy this 100% corn whisky tells a story one you have to suss out gradually. It’s big and flavorful with hints of sweet corn cow barn and spices followed by peppermint lime peel lilacs and oak. Then it turns fresh creamy and alive with invigorating pepper and just a smidgen of sweetness blending lemon drops vanilla and barley sugar until the story resolves satisfyingly on your palate. (Canada only) C$40"
1789,3,"This “amped-up” version of John K. Hall’s signature Barrel Select is not so much better as it is bigger and bolder. Cloves ginger and cinnamon burst over creamy rich butterscotch and searing red pepper restrained only by dry rye grain and bitter orange. The initial fireworks complete figgy dark fruit and nutty milk chocolate swirl capriciously over fragrant spring flowers soft vanilla and delicate herbal maple syrup. Dramatic and delightful."
1790,3,"Pike Creek is all about creating a rich blend then finishing it in barrels previously filled with other flavorful spirits. Standard versions feature Port and rum finishes. This 21 year old edition spent nearly 6 months in Speyside malt whisky casks. The fruity Speysider left no smokiness behind just spices red fruits and buttery barley malt. Extra rye makes for a spicier blend with a longish dark fruit finish."
1791,3,"A growing number of Canadian craft distillers are making Scotch-style single malt whisky and several including Still Waters do quite a good job of it. Round leafy cereal notes on the nose give rise to a granular fruitiness delicate oak caramels and glowering peppers on the palate. It’s beautifully balanced lush and mouth-filling and though delicious now with a few more years it would be stellar. Lovely hot peppers sweet grassiness yellow fruit and a long spicy finish."
1792,3,"Kiwi apricots and other tart fruits precede dry wood and malt on the nose. The sweet lush and weighty palate delivers white pepper and mild oaky tones quickly turning very hot before fading to sweet barley sugar. Butterscotch notes turn watery for a second then hot and fruity with malty herbal tones and sweet baking spices. Finishes on fruit malt bandages and grain dust. Quite complex. $98 CAD"
1793,3,"Skilled whisky makers know many different ways to achieve a particular flavor profile. So when someone mentions rye don’t ask the percentage ask how it was made. Why? Because sometimes Alberta Springs is made entirely from rye grain and sometimes it isn’t. And not even trained tasters can tell. Crisp yet silky with skillfully integrated rye spices riding waves of white pepper. Fruity sweet vanilla citrus zest flaxseed and dusty rye delivered in fresh-cut lumber. (Canada only) C$24"
1794,3,"Until it arrived in U.S. stores earlier this year Gibson’s 12 year old was highly prized by American cross-border whisky shoppers. They made it a duty free staple and no wonder. This is classic old-style Canadian whisky. Seamlessly integrated spicy white pepper refreshing bitterness and succulent butterscotch all burnished with clean oak cinnamon cloves and simmering ginger. It has the creamy body of crème brûlée brightened by a sprinkling of blackstrap molasses. C$22"
1795,3,"This jaunty rye-forward whisky from a mash of 64% corn 31.5% rye and 4.5% barley malt was distilled in an arcane Coffey still and spent seven years in new oak barrels. Flavors vary remarkably among barrels making each of these single barrel bottlings unique. This one exudes sweet floral perfume vanilla oaky tannins sweet and sour sauce spices and basket loads of tropical fruits all centered on soft banana candy. A long spicy velvet tannin finish. (U.S. only)"
1796,3,"The warehouses at Brown-Forman’s Canadian Mist Distillery in Collingwood Ontario hold some rare beauties including this one the result of an experiment using a mashbill rather than processing the individual grains separately. Malty on the nose with hard candies Jujubes and vague sour-mash bread notes. Palate is floral gently perfumed with sweet vanilla mild peppers barrel tones and mildly pulling tannins. Long pleasantly hot cereal-rich finish. (Canada only) $44 CAD"
1797,3,"Single malt whisky from British Columbia-grown and malted barley matured in bourbon barrels then finished in wine barrels from Black Sage Vineyard in B.C.’s Okanagan Valley. Malted barley leaps from the glass along with a vague earthiness and mild fruits. Malty cereal on the palate with vanilla hot spices milk chocolate and purple grapes. The port-style wine influence is tastefully subtle. Finishes on dark fruits and milk chocolate. (Canada only) $60 CAD"
1798,3,"Distillery owner Patrick Evans grows much of the distillery’s barley on his 380-acre farm on the shores of British Columbia’s Straits of Georgia. In 2011 Evans and distiller James Marinus fired up the distillery’s two Forsyths copper pot stills. The resulting single malt is creamy malty and slightly minty. Citrus fruits peach pits and stimulating white pepper slowly fade into gentle barrel notes. (Canada only) $85 CAD"
1799,3,"With Small Batch Wiser’s offers a taste of the quality of its more expensive Legacy to those with a limited whisky budget. This is big whisky at a very affordable price. Cinnamon cloves and candied ginger temper glowing hot pepper while oak caramels and vanilla bolster sweet dark fruit. The earthiness of rye intersects with the fragrance of river plants and wet slate. Red cedar and fresh sawdust round out a clean expressive palate. Lots of weight. C$33"
1800,3,"If you close your eyes the first whiff will carry you into a shoe store with its clean leather and vague sweet waxy polishes. A beautifully constructed fruity creamy full-bodied whisky that shows hints of dry cereal ripe red fruit orange liqueur and early on something vaguely like grape tannins. Clean sparkling peppers enhance the lush fruits while almost citrus-like barrel notes cleanse the palate with their slightly pulling oaky finish. Very tasty. (Canada only) $45 CAD"
1801,3,"Assorted mashes and barrels ensure each batch of Two Brewers malt whisky is unique. When mature about 7 years later these are blended into multi-layered whiskies. Sweet crisp nose then Cheerios dry grain and fresh malt. Vague herbal tones balance hints of ripe fruit. Bright palate with gingery peppers sprinkled on fall fruit—soft apples plums peaches. Lush body then a slight woody tannic pull. (Canada only) C$95"
1802,3,"After more than 60 years in cask this dignified old-time Canadian Club flaunts its age with wood and faintly bitter oak tannins. Initially the nose is closed then opens into cedar with slightly musty wet paper and just hints of fruit. The fruit is big but undefined on the palate with overtones of brisk Epsom salts sweet sandalwood and blistering spices. Teasing hints of varnish clean wood and oat flakes linger long into the finish. (Australia only) A$195"
1803,3,"Canadian whisky makers tend to mash their grains separately then blend them as mature spirits allowing the individual grains to shine. This all-wheat whiskey was matured in used barrels further accentuating these grain flavors. Sweet and light on the nose the palate overflows with toffee and vanilla. Then a vaguely earthy dryness follows glowing white pepper. Robust without the weight of corn this luscious sipping whiskey provides guiltless pleasure with oodles of butterscotch custard orange soda and tingling spices."
1804,3,"“Boiling the hops made them too bitter” says Wiser’s master blender Don Livermore. After more than 100 attempts he cracked the fruity-floral-hops code by “dry hopping” – adding Bravo hops to the finished whisky. Searing spices energize the earthy grassy aroma of a freshly-mown fall meadow. Caramels—some sweet some burnt—with early blushes of coffee or milk chocolate slowly fade into a vaguely bitter finish. (Canada only) C$29"
1805,3,"Rather than complexity this all-corn whisky showcases softness and a rich creamy mouthfeel—even if it does meet the Canadian definition of rye whisky. Peppery spices with a keen bite come from the barrel not grain. Berries and corncobs add depth to fruit cocktail with sharp spices balancing a lush waxiness. Its syrupy feel evolves into kiwi fruit flavors and tartness on the finish. ($45CAD; Canada only)"
1806,3,"Legendary Canadian whisky blender Mike Booth blends small batches within sight of Newfoundland’s Signal Hill using 95% corn and 5% barley whiskies matured in new oak bourbon and Canadian whisky barrels. Golden raisins and dried fruits with brown sugar maple cream dark rum and classic peppery rye spices on the palate. Citrus peel sandalwood vanilla soft oak and a hint of spice. Rummy throughout with blackstrap molasses tugging on the palate in the finish."
1807,11,"Burnt sugar wet raisins oakspice and a deep underlying grain character. Flavors are wonderfully integrated: corn malt mellow syrup hints of ripe plum and grape wrapped in a light confection. Finish is light warm and lingering. Forty Creek releases a limited edition whisky every fall; this one focuses on grains rather than wood according to distiller John Hall. Canadian distribution only."
1808,3,"Mild peat smoke wafts into the room as soon as you pull the cork. A big fruity nose ripe with red apples and hints of ether rides the peat. Sweetish spices glow with hints of chocolate then fade slowly into typical malty tones that in turn become dry cereal notes. A flash of soapiness on first sip never returns but lessens an otherwise beautiful young whisky. Canada’s Sesquicentennial Celebratory Release. C$70"
1809,3,"Slaty minerals fruitiness and floral hints on the nose suggest plenty of rye in this satisfying complex dram. More mineral notes emerge on the crisp sweet palate along with citrus elements burley tobacco hints of wine dark chocolate mild vanilla and subtle oak. A soft peppery spice bursts onto the mid-palate and throat. A bit austere but with toffee sweetness and mild fudge. Mouth-filling though a bit dry."
1810,3,"Seven years after distilling their first drop Still Waters can barely keep up with demand. The single malt distillery took a giant step forward when partners Barry Stein and Barry Bernstein decided to mash some rye grain. Rye is now more than half of their production. Waxy sizzling-hot spices and a lovely leafy sweetness lead to softer peppers hints of vanilla and a mildly floral palate. Linseed oil and a slippery palate suggest chocolate but only just."
1811,3,"Since Canadian Club refined its batching process this 12 year old whisky has begun to show pleasing differences among batches. And though a batch is exactly that a batch bottling codes reveal that different bottle sizes of a single batch can be filled weeks apart. Caramel dark fruits and luscious sweetness jump out of the glass to fill the room. Behind that the classic Canadian Club pruniness butterscotch and hot pepper ride on a wagonload of dried oak timber."
1812,3,"Drinkers with a refined palate will enjoy the breadth and complexity of this whisky the session drinker its velvety smoothness. Barrel notes from toasted vanilla to caramelized sugar and spicy cloves give way to pickle-sour rye and bitter citrus pith. Searing peppers and ginger keep it exciting as dark fruits and black cherries fade to lime pith and peel. A long glowing finish. (Australia only) $43 AUD"
1813,3,"Rye flour powerful rye spices—hot sweet and flavorful—bathed in flaxseed oil. Fragrant hints of breakfast tea blend with ripe dark fruit peaches and rich lilac perfume. Sweet and sour and quite peppery with a long finish. Made with nothing but rye grain yet there is a certain slippery quality more commonly found in corn whisky. This is Still Waters distillery at its best."
1814,3,"What a difference a cask can make. This first-fill bourbon barrel has more robust flavors but noticeably less color than its antecedent Cask 1. Linseed oil raw canvas and freshly dug blue clay form a rich earthy base for flourishes of clean spirit dry straw and Chinese plum sauce. Hot pepper and pulling dry wood yield to
cherry blossoms maraschino and sautéed mushrooms. A splash of water unveils milk chocolate rye crisps and creamy custard. C$100"
1815,3,"Rye grain Bavarian sour rye bread rich linseed oil and vague hints of peppermint drift out of the bottle when you first pull the cork. The sweet oily palate is alive with ginger and wasabi accented by acetone high fruity esters and teasing hints of sweet flowers. Notes of plasticine and the earthiness of river plants add complexity. The whisky sizzles with pepper throughout returning to sour rye as the finish fades ever so slowly."
1816,3,"By finishing this blend of two sourced whiskies in its own maritime rum barrels Authentic Seacoast Distillery gives this classic Canadian whisky a somehow tropical twist. Oily molasses undertones on the nose continue onto a spicy palate which is syrupy but not slippery with hints of wet slate bananas and heavy fruit. Barrel notes and suggestions of dry oak restrain an initially lush mouthfeel. (Nova Scotia only) $55 CAD"
1817,3,"Last Straw’s inaugural whisky is a humdinger of a 100% rye with oodles of oomph and a pleasing balance of grain and barrel notes. Youthfully malty it shows rye spices dry hay barrel tones hot black licorice some citrus notes and candied fruit. Hints of butterscotch and vanilla temper black pepper and sweet pine pitch. Lots of nuances for a 3 year old. The flavor sings at bottle strength. $75 CAD"
1818,3,"Distilled in western Canada then shipped to Guysborough Nova Scotia Glynnevan is re-barreled for a final seaside stint. It’s authentic Seacoast Distilling Company-brewed beer prior to distilling into whisky. Brisk spicy nose with oak caramels beeswax hints of celery and layers of green fruit. Luscious spicy palate loaded with citrus notes vanilla beans and pleasing bitter pith. Earthy alongside wet slate and sweet spices. (Canada only) C$45"
1819,3,"J.P. Wiser’s signature is on the label but the whisky itself bears the toasted-oak hallmarks of Corby master blender Dr. Don Livermore. There’s a lot to enjoy in this creamy lush whisky. An initial blast of sweet caramel lingers as sour rye and bitter citrus pith emerge. These soon grow into hot gingery fizz and burned toffee. Dark fruits turn to citrus notes and cherry licorice while sizzling ginger mellows into softly glowing white pepper."
1820,3,"In June 2013 flooding washed away most of Highwood’s finished whisky. Although barrels in the warehouse went unscathed new releases such as this one have been limited. Too bad. Initial nose tickle erupts into sweet caramel and rich black fruits. Hot pepper trickling down your throat leaves a lovely hot burn followed by waves of sweet saltwater taffy. Yes it’s slightly salty. Weighty and mouth-coating this whisky feels big and full in the mouth. (Alberta/British Columbia only.) C$28"
1821,3,"Blending two types of 100% rye with creamy corn whisky creates a complex dram that feels as good as it tastes. Sizzling peppers and nutty grains playfully torment fresh-cut cedar and dry oak all on a comforting blanket of butterscotch. Street-roasted chestnuts and coffee beans bring depth. Pepper dominates yet the mouth feels soft and sweet. Otherwise-muted fruity and floral notes blossom with a dash of water. (Canada only) C$29"
1822,3,"A straightforward 4 year old Canadian blend great for mixing but good for sipping too. It presents flavors of toffee brisk spices kiwi fruit charred wood and sweet barley sugars. A creamy body with pleasingly penetrating pepper that feels minty-warm like menthol. Not overly complex but getting there. More pepper and a refreshing slightly bitter pithiness on a medium finish. A creamy palate soothes the energetic attack of the spices."
1823,3,"This export-only Pike Creek reminds us of the year-to-year differences we can expect from whisky that spends Canada’s brutal winters (and sweltering summers) in unheated warehouses. Slightly younger than the Canada-only version this is just different enough to be its own whisky. Gingery hot pepper laces its way through sweet ripe red fruit as vague menthol with a slight herbal edge slips gently into silky oak tannins. Finishes cleanly with a citrus pithiness."
1824,3,"In the 1980s when white spirits elbowed whisky aside in the marketplace unneeded barrels of Canadian Club continued aging. Japanese whisky lovers delighted by the resulting flavor boost demanded a new Japan-only CC. Sweet and hot the classic pruney figgy fruitiness of Canadian Club interweaves with new cedar fence posts. Vaguely pulling tannins lend a bitter edge that first amplifies blistering hot pepper then muffles it into the soothing glowing warmth of bubbly ginger ale. (Japan only) ¥ 3375"
1825,3,"Distilled and matured under the midnight sun in Whitehorse Yukon Two Brewers whiskies benefit from having a brewery to keep the cash flow positive during the 7 year maturation period and a brewer to manage the fermentation flavors. Peat smoke freshly-washed hospital garments antiseptic—typical Islay with a lot more fruitiness. Sweet canned fruit cocktail and persistent smokiness all wrapped together in a neatly-balanced unit. Hot peppers hints of green licorice and caramel. C$95"
1826,3,"Raising the bar a little higher Still Waters is introducing Red Label a blend that is rich in 100% rye all-corn and single malt whiskies. The undisclosed base whisky is sourced the rest made in-house. Luscious with sweet esters lilacs white clover blossoms oak sugars vanilla and a brace of warming spices. Round mouth-filling and creamy on the palate and after a second pleasing rye spices emerge. Hints of barrel notes with glowing pepper and citrus pith. Mix or sip. C$40"
1827,11,"Still Waters blends sourced whiskey with under 9.09% of their own young spirit as top dressing (hence the name; it’s one part in eleven). Sweet cereal honey and flowers on the nose which become much more authoritative in the mouth. Still sweet but with a firm thump on the tongue hot thin honey crushed flower petals and a lively welcome heat for 40%. Clean cereal-honey finish. Could be a bit more robust but I like it fine as it is. (Ontario exclusive)C$35"
1828,11,"Nose is much more integrated than the others; caramel and light honey tones with an oaky vein. After four CCs that were sequentially innocent clumsy eager and balanced this one is confident: well-rounded sweet but not goopy oaked but not prickly. Well-named: this is a classic Canadian."
1829,3,"The warehouses at Glenora are not heated so aging virtually stops in winter. Thus the whisky doesn’t reach its peak until its mid-teens. By then it is malty fresh crisp and grassy with hints of vanilla and delicate slightly bitter fruits including apricots and citrus pith. Fragile floral notes join exotic hints of mango and a nuttiness reminiscent of almond skins and sweetened coconut. Air do dheag slàinte Glenora as they say in Cape Breton’s Gaelic Highlands. (Canada only)"
1830,3,"Aromas of halva dry hay poached pears and apple pie. The palate is sweet and full with ripe cherries and a certain earthiness along with dusty grain and aromatic wet hay. Peppery heat enhances hot ginger and cinnamon hearts. This is malt whisky held together by strong cereal notes with a fruity creamy medium finish. It’s already tasty at 3 years; one wonders what glories another 3 would bring."
1831,3,"Fruity with dried dates and figs peaches peach pits purple plum pits and hints of black licorice. Tingling cloves and ginger add zip to traces of bitter chewing tobacco. Powerful firm and drying with pulling tannins like a fine Bordeaux. While this is gorgeous whisky in its own right the French oak flavors have overwhelmed the familiar clean spicy fruity base of the original Masterson’s on which it was built. (U.S. only)"
1832,3,"Ontario government retailer LCBO bought this barrel for an exclusive bottling and it’s a doozie. The first nose is all fresh flaxseed before peppermint anise and sweet fragrant flowers waft in. A few minutes later the nose morphs into peach cobbler with lingering suggestions of dry grain. Cooked peaches sustain the palate until sweet spices arrive bringing hints of oak and creamy barley sugar with them. There’s lots of action in this whisky glass. (Ontario only) C$70"
1833,2,"Appealing notes of sweet mesquite barbecue butterscotch candied nuts warm cookies and a very pleasant Southwest smokiness. The palate is light in body offering notes of bitter chocolate herbs and spice with the mesquite note lingering. There’s more sweetness and chocolate on the finish; a tasty profile but somewhat light-bodied. The nose is the best part. The palate and finish are balanced but it’s a bit light and lacking in depth."
1834,3,"Like many older corn whiskies this one unfolds slowly. Strong Cadbury caramel bar and slightly meaty with sour fruits and cedar on the nose. Sweet and hot with floral notes and initially a discordant touch of perfume. Pulling tannins provide structure for glowing pepper sultanas sweet spring flowers some earthiness and a touch of wet slate. Not as woody as most whiskies this age; a testament to long maturation in used barrels. (Cadenhead’s exclusive Great Britain and Europe) £128"
1835,3,"Caldera Distilling of River John Nova Scotia sits across Northumberland Strait from Green Gables Prince Edward Island. Its namesake whisky is made in a tiny alembic still from grain grown right on the distillery property then blended with rye whisky from Alberta. Fruity with oak caramels burnt firewood herbal tones and glowing peppery spices. Mild vanilla citrus pith buttery fudge and a long warming glow in the chest. (Canada only) C$34"
1836,3,"Canada’s sub-arctic Yukon Territory has become fertile ground for making whisky. Blended from a mix of barrels distilled in 2009 then finished in Pedro Ximenez sherry barrels Two Brewers Release 2 shows multi-layered complexity. Lovely sherry notes meld into rich malty grain. Sweet and warming with tinges of sandalwood apples and exotic fruits. Silky mouthfeel finishing on the vaguest notions of wildflower honey and wintergreen. (Canada only) C$95"
1837,3,"Beginning with dried orange peels and steely rye that smells like a creek bed the nose slowly develops light fruit caramel and vanilla fudge. Finally pears sweet plums and raspberries emerge. On the palate Midnight erupts into glowing hot spices citrusy sweetness dark fruits candied ginger and mildly grassy prairie sage. The heat and sweetness build into plummy sweet and sour sauce with vague hints of barrel notes. The long finish is unusually spicy."
1838,3,"Starts off sweet followed by nutmeg cinnamon clean oak and a zesty bitterness. This austere yet elegant whisky slowly develops a deep complexity. Silky corn and bourbon-like vanilla toffee override distinct suggestions of apple juice as dusty rye along with hints of dry grass lead into mashy cereal notes. Finishes with tightly integrated flavors of white pepper gingery spices hints of fresh-cut wood and hot peppermint. Lovely. (Canada only) C$37"
1839,3,"This 5 year old corn whisky is blended with mature rye and single malt creating a soft and creamy dram with flickers of grain dust and smatterings of spice. Pleasantly hot with sweet spices and fruit market aromas. Very pleasant esters hints of acetone and pepper it fades into corn syrup and traces of cinnamon. More woodiness would raise the score. (Distillery-only bottling or by mail order in Ontario) Canada’s Sesquicentennial Celebratory Release. C$45"
1840,11,"Sweet rich candy — pulled taffy boiled sweets — with a little hot edge. Signature Canadian sweetness but with more depth and a gently mouth-coating feel. Touches of vanilla caramel and some of those candy notes again but the finish isn’t cloying. No overt evidence of the toasted maplewood finishing. Another exploration of what Canadian whisky is or can be that stays within bounds and makes the sweet whisky idea work."
1841,11,"Aged 10 years in icewine barrels — a Canadian specialty — and like icewine comes in a tiny bottle. Sweet malt aromas some grape character with a brandy-like edge slicing through it. The high proof comes through as evaporative rather than hot and it’s quite drinkable undiluted: some creaminess even and some of that sweet icewine intensity to it. A drop of water brings more whisky out: bold a bit hot. The icewine finishing is an experiment with promise. Price is per 250 ml."
1842,3,"A slightly closed nose opens to pleasing meatiness then green fruits with hints of evergreen. The palate is sweet and surprisingly rich although fairly simple. Strong peppery spices and something pleasantly vegetal creep in. Slowly the sweetness becomes unctuous turning an otherwise fine sipping whisky into a mixer. Brisk spices provide a counterpoint to the sweetness but the balance seems off. Some structure finally develops around suggestions of dark chocolate."
1843,3,"Just four years ago two Barrys—Stein and Bernstein—opened the doors of Still Waters distillery on
the northern edge of Toronto. Distinct notes of poached pears marzipan flaky halva and cinnamon apple pie embellish sweet ripe cherries nutmeg and a vague earthiness. Oatmeal dry grain and hot pepper combine on a sweet polished palate. C$100"
1844,3,"Ellington has the creamy sweet and ultra-smooth mouthfeel down pat. Canada likes its mixing whisky to bite a little but America prefers a silky smooth glide right down the gullet. Ellington Reserve certainly delivers with its rich almost oily aura that springs to life with spicy-hot white pepper and newly-split clean firewood. Caramel and brown sugar underscore distinct notes of perfumed candy-coated licorice amidst fragrant orange blossoms and flat lemon-lime soda. C$17"
1845,3,"A mash of 95% local rye and 5% malted barley is distilled on the grain then matured for 3-plus years in new custom toasted full-sized bourbon barrels. Expect loads of vanilla and bold barrel notes over dry grass and nutty clean grain. Despite the hot spicy intensity lovely mild sweet lemon notes come right to the front. Bottled barrel by barrel so expect some minor variability. Look for a red stripe on the label. (Canada only) $60 CAD"
1846,9,"Light on the nose with creamy vanilla honey soft oak and delicate tropical fruit. Similar follow-through on the palate. I like how creamy and clean it is -- especially for 21 years old. It’s a light whisky the kind that 21 years in the wood could have put a hurtin’ on but it didn’t. An enjoyable Canadian whisky. (Exclusive to the Canadian market.)"
1847,11,"Sweet nose with a hint of soft-boiled egg digestive biscuit and cedar (nowhere near as nasty as it might sound!) Warming orange peel notes toffee rye grassiness a trace of horehound and light oaky vanilla make a sweet but somewhat angular mouthful. Finish is a bit edgy and boozy; the weakest link in the glass. A bit of water helps the finish a lot. Nothing sticks out too much; a good whisky. (Canada only.) C$24"
1848,12,"Walk into a pastry shop and inhale the aromas of coconut cake confectioners’ sugar lemon cream almond paste and vanilla. Then take a sip: coconut custard slivered almonds vanilla and sweet bread dough. The grain whisky is at the forefront here lending simplicity and insistent sweetness. (Total Wine & More)"
1849,12,"Sweet fruity and floral with orange-blossom water Juicy Fruit gum toasted coconut and honey. The palate is simple and grain-forward with vanilla coconut and frosted cookie. Light facile and very sweet this whisky won’t satisfy those seeking complexity but works well for uncomplicated sipping. (Costco)"
1850,3,"Although much praised Potter’s was a mythical distillery. It had no still but sold whisky purchased from others. This straightforward all-corn whisky shows dusty corncobs on the nose with sweet and sour sauce caramel oak cinnamon bark and intriguing hints of pine needles. The palate is broader beginning with a very sweet and zesty spicy rush followed by sweet wood a syrupy mouthfeel tasting of prune dark ripe fruits and sour citrus notes. (126 bottles; UK only) £75"
1851,3,"Luscious sweet maltiness underlies a breadth of flavor that belies this whisky’s youth. Hints of acetone green fruit and hard pears joust playfully with earthy tones and elements of blue clay. Vague references to mulled red wine center around fleeting cinnamon sticks ripe red fruit and the grainy bitterness of buckwheat honey. Rich in grain and grasses the palate is sweet oily and very spicy. Bottling at 46% and not chill filtering should please the anoraks. (Distillery only.) C$70"
1852,3,"A surprisingly tasty “buyers own brand” of unknown origin. Its lush fruity caramel-rich nose foreshadows a sweet mouth-coating luxury. Baskets of orchard fruits and bowls of stewed fruit are accented by cinnamon mild ginger root and spicy white pepper. The round syrupy mouth feel carries right into a creamy but gently bitter glowing hot finish. Meticulously well-balanced and the very definition of smooth."
1853,3,"The second whisky from this Canadian craft distillery is a blend of three barrels of 100 percent rye whisky. Maturation for 3½ years in once-used red wine barrels has integrated distinct ripe fruits into the spiciness of rye grain. Youth is obvious in the earthy malty elements and the peppery heat and there are distinct suggestions of clean blue clay. Its full body rich flavors and the fruit-spice balance speak well for the future of whisky from 66Gilead. (Canada only)"
1854,3,"This is pipeline whisky made to be used in a Highball. That said Lord Calvert is a solid blend to begin with and this beefed-up version makes all the right noises for cocktails or mixing with ginger ale. Sweet caramels hot peppers and hints of dry grain are bolstered by ripe dark fruits and spicy rye. This is simple well-made whisky that shines best when mixed."
1855,11,"Darker gold in the glass than regular VO but sporting that same VO nose of caramel and dry corn. Fuller grain sweetness in the mouth with some nice light fruitiness—white peach seckel pear—coming out and there’s a sweet cinnamon smear along the roof of the mouth. Dries significantly toward the end and finishes quickly but with everything in good order."
1856,3,"Distiller Colin Schmidt is earning his blending chops honestly using sourced whiskies to keep the cash flow positive while his own distillate matures. Sweet burned wood underpins rich dried fruit hints of crisp oak butterscotch pudding and sour gooseberries. Hot pepper and cinnamon enliven a syrupy mouthfeel as the palate broadens into warm clean earth and dry weathered barn board. A long lingering burn finishes in tingling ginger ale and candied citrus peel. (Distillery only) C$50"
1857,3,"After Crown Royal is bottled the barrels are refilled with new whisky spirit to spend three more years in silent slumber. “Crown washes out the woodiness and leaves the velvet behind” one distillery worker enthuses. “We probably drink more of this in Gimli than the rest of the country combined.” The steely dusty rye charcoal tinges blistering white pepper creamy butterscotch pudding and candied ginger of Canadian 83 are the restrained confident declaration of hard-bit whisky makers. C$24"
1858,3,"From a bourbon-style mashbill matured in new Missouri oak this first whisky from 66 Gilead salutes Wild Oak farm where contented cattle dine on the distillery’s spent grains. Dry grain gray weathered wood sea breezes caramel and soft earthy woody notes become vanilla saltwater taffy cherries and fruit punch with herbal hints of celery. It’s hot and spicy with sizzling pepper and searing ginger over a barrelhouse woodiness. Young but not rough with a long peppery finish."
1859,3,"It is unfortunate that Glenora does not mark lot numbers as each succeeding batch improves over previous ones. Gone are the soapy notes that oozed out of the bottle keeping early releases from showing their strength. While the nose is big on the palate the whisky becomes light with brisk spiciness some malt and subtle oak. Glen Breton is known for its red apple notes and gentle flowers. To these now add pepper honey caramel and light oak."
1860,3,"Hard to find Harvey’s Bristol Cream sherry casks are the secret of this big fruity whisky and also the reason it varies among batches. Rumors that Sherry Cask will be discontinued in the U.S. are true so stock up now. Otherwise be prepared for some cross-border shopping in Canada where it will continue to be available. The sweet sherry influence is obvious in ripe dark currants golden raisins and dates. A Brio-like nuttiness gives way to hot pepper."
1861,3,"Sweet candy nose and a sour rye palate. Tropical fruit and orange zest with sweet golden sultanas sour apricot strudel and Jujubes on the nose follow through to the palate where they are joined by oak caramel vanilla and dusty grain. Peppery spices linger throughout. Wraps up with clean grain pepper and sweetish fruits. (Canada only) $23 CAD"
1862,3,"This mingling of Still Waters’ own mature corn rye and malt whiskies with undisclosed sourced base whisky is sweeter and punchier than the Stalk & Barrel White Label blend it replaces. Clear malt notes soft caramels apple juice and mild sweet flowers on the nose. The palate shows oak caramels vanilla and some mild white pepper. Becomes very zesty in the mouth with a long peppery pulling finish. A pleasing but fairly simple whisky more for mixing than sipping. C$33"
1863,3,"They call it cowboy whisky: Smallish bottlers mostly in the western U.S. buy custom-blended bulk whisky from Canada to release under their own label. This one has enough cachet to find its way back north and into the Canadian market. Sweet and smooth with rich buttery caramels searing pepper sizzling ginger and slatey dusty rye. Rich dark fruits on the palate turn to zesty citrus notes then cleansing pith as one sip slowly dissolves into the next. C$25"
1864,3,"Heavy caramel hints of pansies dustiness warming spices gentle pepper and bushels of fruit. The amontillado sherry finish gives a tannic red wine feel without much wineyness. About that finish: rather than “rejuvenating” barrels by pouring in sherry and swishing it around before adding the whisky sherry was blended directly with mature 8 year old Canadian rye which then spent two months in American oak barrels. Whisky purists may recoil but the result is very tasty dram. (U.S. only)"
1865,9,"Fruity on the nose and palate (orange peel lime lemon pineapple). Very smooth and creamy too with notes of vanilla and a touch of honey. Underlying brittle mint delicate floral notes and even a hint of sandalwood gives the whisky some dimension. Very clean and nicely rounded. The problem with many Canadian whiskies is that they are too harsh when young but get too woody when aged for ten or more years because they are too thin in body to stand up to the oak. This one has matured nicely while still maintaining good balance and drinkability."
1866,3,"Distilled from a mash of malted two-row Canadian barley and matured indoors for exactly 1221 days in a first-fill bourbon barrel Cask 8 is glowingly warm with soaring notes of acetone and sweet esters on a base redolent of linseed oil gunnysacks and grassy cereals. The palate is sweetish like gummy bears and very spicy. Pepper ginger and hot cinnamon bathe in a weighty creamy body. A longish finish shows soft oaky barrel notes. (Distillery only) C$70"
1867,3,"Sweeter on the nose than the palate with crème caramel autumn fruits and sweet rye spices. Initial caramel notes become peppery with raging heat that glows in the throat. A creamy mouthfeel works hard to resist this incursion of hot rye spices and searing cayenne pepper. Feels hotter than 40% with sizzling spices but no alcohol burn. Fruity notes come and go centered on cooked apples. Eventually fades to a long sourish bitter-orange finish."
1868,3,"Reminiscent of old-style sherry malts with round mellow oaky notes and a dusty waxy farmy feel that evolves into dark fruit and striking gunpowder on the nose. Odd and enticing. The oily palate shows taffy blistering white pepper fresh pine sawdust and ripe fruits with chocolatey suggestions of Tootsie Rolls. Starts big then moves to a quick spicy-hot resolution. People who think all-wheat whisky is mild or weak really need to try this luscious beauty. $35 CAD"
1869,3,"This odd bird illustrates the yin-yang plight of the craft distiller. Pablum sweet mash grain dust dry green hay and linseed oil imbued with melon bespeak a telltale immature nose while the palate rich in grapes peaches and exotic tropical fruits laced with hot cinnamon allspice and pepper denotes maturity. Blue clay creamy barley sugar and a soft waxiness temper gently-pulling oak tannins while inklings of green apple peels round out a sizzling palate. (Victoria Spirits distillery only) C$100"
1870,3,"Micro-distiller Tyler Schramm studied distilling at Scotland’s Heriot-Watt University. Clearly he learned not to release whisky until it is mature. A waxy grassy nose delights with dry grain fresh-cut hay red fruits and cinnamon hearts. The palate though less complex shows wheelbarrow loads of sweet fruits soft spices earthy notes and bracing heat. Green grasses pink clover and hints of black licorice precede a long peppery grassy floral finish. (Canada only) C$90"
1871,3,"Oh! The glory of new wood. Even dialed back from 6 years old to 5 this version pushes Canadian Club’s entry level mixing whisky into sippin’ territory. The century-old formula is unchanged but brand new oak emphasizes the rye grain while injecting soft oak caramels and crispy bright barrel notes into the familiar peppery overripe dark fruit of one of the world’s longest continuously produced whiskies. A long gingery finish touches on sweet grapefruit and chili peppers."
1872,11,"A bit of heat faint nose of putty light brown sugar and fully ripe grapes. Stand-up whisky: sweet grain a bit of rye spice oak notes and a good release on the finish. Just a touch of hollow sweetness in the middle a kind of flat spot."
1873,11,"8 years old and sherry finished and it shows in the darker color. Sweet dark fruit aromas; a bit sugary. Waxy fruit and caramel wood spice and some oaky prickliness on center tongue as the whisky fades. More interesting than the standard but a bit thick."
1874,11,"A U.S.-only Canadian blend bottled in Oregon. Rich toffee and caramel aroma with cashews and some dry cocoa. An easy entry with sweet light but coating caramel a keening note of young blending whisky some cedar shavings and a sweet finish that manages not to cling. Simple and sweet practically pining for a bubbly mixer but not bad for dessert either. Quite typical of the category."
1875,3,"The freshly opened bottle smells promising with spirit toffee suggestions of cloves a blast of steely rye and grapefruit juice on the nose. On the palate it is sweet somewhat hot slightly perfumed and overall quite simple. A lovely glow in the back of the mouth and on the tongue doesn’t last but is replaced by hints of caramel and citrus fruit. Good solid session whisky."
1876,3,"The nose shows great promise with real maple syrup gummy bears hints of peppermint and cinnamon and clean lumber. Tangerine juice dark fruits white pepper and ginger seem somehow less than the nose predicted. It feels good with its creamy smooth palate and glowing gingery heat. Finishes with mild grapefruit pith and searing pepper that goes on forever."
1877,3,"Still Waters distillery’s owners invited customers to select their next single cask release. Noting the soft cereal notes stewed apples and raisins and hot spices in an oily body they recommended this one. A fruity nose with barrel tones and icing sugar blossoms in the glass while the hot spicy palate shows hints of licorice cloves and vanilla. A good dash of water mollifies a drying tendency without dampening the flavor or creaminess. (Distillery only) C$100"
1878,3,"Highwood Distillers has returned from their devastating 2013 flood with better whisky than ever. A soft sweet fruity nose understates the power of an intensely spicy palate chock-full of sour bitter kumquats. Subtle honey flavors abound with delicate threads of golden burley tobacco entwined. It’s a simple dram for mixing but with plenty of interest to satisfy those who would rather sip. Add ginger ale and ice or drink straight up. (Canada only) C$30"
1929,3,"One of the Barton whiskies acquired by Sazerac in 2009 Canadian Supreme is a dry dusty mixer that blossoms in ginger ale. Neat the nose opens slowly to dried fruit while the palate is grassy almost mashy with butterscotch pudding and a peppery glow. Though not at all tannic still it becomes a bit pulling in the middle before giving way to prunes raspberries and maraschino cherries. The finish is surprisingly long and hot."
1879,3,"Alberta’s Liquor Depot has chosen a tiny Ontario distillery for an exclusive single malt bottling. Still Waters in Toronto is Canada’s first craft distillery to bottle single malt whisky. This one is peppery hot and bathed in sweet barley sugar clover honey and rich oaky caramels. Brisk nutty and oaky it remains sweet with green pears. A weighty body with grassiness dry grain and hot white pepper typifies Still Waters’ emerging house style. (Alberta only.) C$70"
1880,3,"This sweet peppery dram secures Still Waters’ reputation for single malt prodigies: young whiskies mature beyond their years. Cinnamon enhanced by mild herbal bitterness rides waves of barley sugar. Sweetness and heat grow stronger as the whisky sits in your mouth. Water brings grassiness to the nose and cooked cream of wheat to the palate. Mid-palate hints of celery add breadth while linseed oil earthy blue clay and hints of eucalyptus linger in a long peppery finish. (U.S. only.)"
1881,3,"Balance makes this simple session whisky a well-loved hot Sunday sipper while searing pepper and vanilla-rich butterscotch lend it well to mixing. Order rye and ginger in a bar in Canada and you may well find yourself savoring Special Old. Toffee with hints of ginger on the nose broaden into blazing chilies with notes of cloves and cinnamon. Soft barrel notes damp earth and sweet toffee segue neatly into a very long hot bitter cleansing finale. (Canada only)"
1882,11,"Sweet Canadian whisky nose taffy some vanilla. Taste is fairly rich with notes of port and light cocoa leading to a clean finish with a good grip. Not a tremendously deep whisky but approachable and free of flaws."
1883,3,"12 year old 100% Canadian rye-grain whisky is transported from Canada to Hood River Distillers’ plant in Oregon where after adding glacier water from Mt. Hood it is bottled. Tart lime juice ginger and seething pepper brighten a rich combination of vanilla butterscotch and maple fudge. Crisp charred oak meets wet slate as raisins meld into floral notes with tinges of Canada balsam and fresh-cut pine. This rich weighty well-balanced whisky is decidedly fresh and exuberant."
1884,11,"Standard bottling benchmark. Smells sweet caramel and toffee with some alcohol heat and a slight medicinal twang. Strong caramel flavor (is that where that rich amber color came from?) not particularly deep or complex but not hot or flawed either leading to a gentle sweet finish. Not bad at all for a mixing whisky."
1885,3,"Bonded Stock was a Gooderham and Worts brand until Harry Hatch moved production to Windsor during Prohibition. Dry grain with hints of bicycle tires on the nose become barley sugar and fiery pepper on the palate. Simple with a delicate balance of hot ginger licorice root spearmint savory herbs watery caramel and mild ripe fruit ending with a refreshing bitter tinge. Old-time hard-rye mixing whisky but go ahead sneak a wee sip."
1886,3,"Whisky maker John Hall says value whiskies save used barrels from being wasted. Study the label and you’ll find this lush mixer hails from Hall’s Forty Creek distillery. Sweet voluptuous butterscotch and corn syrup slather peppery heat and the mildest tannins. The pepper turns ticklish on the roof of your mouth until charred wood burned toffee and vanilla custard flow over it. Simple but very sippable it’s a bit luxurious for a mixing whisky. (Canada only) C$24"
1887,3,"For years about half a dozen large oak barrels of malt spirit sat ignored against the wall of the shop at Okanagan distillery in Vernon BC. Fruit spirit is their main product. Finally those barrels have been disgorged and blended into a fruit-forward single malt that tilts and dips like a butterfly in flight. Ripe cherries and dried apricots flit through Kraft caramels and green apple Twizzlers into a long glowing sunset of hot spices and floral breezes. C$70"
1888,3,"Willie Blazer imports 100% rye whisky from Alberta then brings it to bottling strength at his Ennis Montana distillery with water from the nearby Madison River. Canadian whisky figured large in the history of the West and Willie’s is a local bestseller. Caramel and rye spices on the nose toast and plum jam sweet yet bracing spices a long lovely glow deep in your chest. A simple sipper or a monster mixer with cloves fruitcake white pepper and gentle pithiness."
1889,3,"Fairly simple with strong butterscotch hints of humbugs burnt sugar and red fruits. Lovely intro though with petrichor: the vaguely vegetal scent of new rain and old punky logs. Maturation in once-used bourbon barrels leaves a soft smooth mouthfeel that says “session whisky” This soon becomes chewy then juicy as increasingly hot pepper moves to the fore. Finishes with pleasing fading bitter citrus pith."
1890,3,"Creamy butterscotch soothes the blazing hot spices of this archetypal Canadian mixing whisky. Fresh kiwi fruit and lime fragrances add dimension to a sweet glowing middle then fade on a long toffeeish finish that finally slips into slight hints of bitter grapefruit pith. A sweet simple and fruity session whisky that you could sip neat all evening or over ice at a sunny poolside. A mixer yes and a sipper too. (Canada only) C$26"
1891,9,"The newest offering from Crown Royal. Drier and more spice with less of the creaminess of its siblings. I enjoy the subtle dry complexity on the nose and the promise on the first part of the palate. But the whisky quickly turns quite dry on the latter part with the oak playing the dominant role. XR contains older whiskies (including some from the old Waterloo distillery) so this is a rare whisky indeed but it is difficult to improve on the profound effort of Crown Royal Special Reserve."
1892,9,"Light in body and on the nose but clean and elegant. Notes of delicate fruit vanilla and honey with a touch of caramel and coconut cream. Soft clean finish. A pleasant conservative whisky."
1893,9,"Very clean elegant and well-rounded with honey-kissed fruit vanilla and subtle spice. Very versatile. I would normally drink a whisky like this on the rocks or use it as a mixer. But in a pinch I could drink it neat."
1894,3,"A mild nose with hints of caramel and dry grasses just vaguely suggests the flavors that wait in the glass. The sweetness of navel oranges and slow-developing peppery notes lead into the classic Canadian combination of caramel cloves ginger and white pepper. Earthy vegetal tones almost like riverweeds and a strong but pleasant bitterness are glazed with creamy Mackintosh caramel. Dusty grain and pepper fade quickly in a shortish finish."
1895,3,"Typical rye spices bathe in rich smooth caramels and burnt sugar with a gingery cayenne burn. Real black pepper engulfs cloves and cinnamon in a fiery and vibrant display while vague tones of milk chocolate gently cool things down. Then an oiliness and mouth-filling richness sweep over a tinge of bitter herbal elixir and yes sawdust. This classic high-rye whisky from Alberta Distillers brings suggestions of dark fruit to an underlying nuttiness."
1896,11,"A nose like light caramel corn with a hint of biscuit dryness and a smidgen of cinnamon sugar. Light in the mouth sweet and a bit spicy with some cinnamon heat toward the end. There is a bit of a roar right in the middle where the grainy sweetness catches fire briefly but mostly this is fairly meek stuff. Made for mixing no real flaws."
1897,3,"An all-rye grain mash yields this almost tequila-like whisky that was blended to tempt the agave-blessed Mexican palate. Hot earthy and somewhat muddy with the black pepper signature of tequila it gradually becomes sweet and creamy with vague hints of black licorice. Strong herbal undertones suggest dill pickles. Hard slatey rye grain softens into blue clay. The sintering heat lingers right to the end as do earthiness and agave-like black pepper ¡Hola! (Mexico only) 99 Mexican pesos"
1898,3,"Sweet creamy toffee with hot and spicy undertones builds gradually to a peak then fades into classic bitter pith. Caramels mute the hardness of rye grain as it too fades in advancing waves of gingery pepper. Definitely a mixing whisky now Lord Calvert tells one and all that their cocktail was made with wood-aged whisky. Hints of grassiness and dry white wine add breadth to a whisky that in days long past was intended to be sipped neat."
1899,11,"Pale almost peach color. Light aromas of caramel sweet citrus. Tastes of sweet caramel faint bite of oak on the end. Simple but clean and pleasant. You’d have to be careful mixing this — it would get lost easily — but it should be nice on the rocks or with seltzer."
1900,3,"My goodness this woman is an innovator. Distillery owner Sophia Pantazi stored her maple syrup in whisky barrels. Then once the syrup was bottled she refilled those barrels with whisky spirit giving maple-aged whisky. Grain chocolate and winter-welcome glowing spices quickly overtake a malty grainy perfumey note characteristic of young whisky. Though creamy sweet the whisky has more toffee notes than maple syrup. Hot beyond its ABV and wanting a couple more years’ maturation. (Distillery only) Price is per 375 ml."
1901,9,"Unusually sweet and perfumed. Layers of malty sweetness (honey butterscotch caramel vanilla wafers) is the dominant feature of this whisky with background notes of almonds toasted oak and citrus fruit. Herbal hay notes also emerge from time to time. This is not an overly complex whisky. It is also a tad fiery at times (alluding to its youthful age) but this whisky is an improvement over a previous sample I tasted from this distillery a year or two ago."
1902,3,"This is the latest in an ongoing series of organic single-field white whiskies from Toronto distillery. In 2013 summer rains imbued Ontario spring wheat with softer nuttier and more complex flavors than 2012. These show here on the nose as lemon oil fragrant spring violets and newly harvested grain. A sweet spicy palate is alive with real lemons yellow plums fresh straw and sweet lingering white pepper. Mouth coating and big. (Ontario only) C$40/375 ml."
1903,3,"When high-rye whisky seemed doomed some hard-bit fans longed to taste a simple mixer called Alberta Premium. With few ryes to compare reviewers assessed this all-rye grain whisky generously. Today with rye whisky booming and rye’s flavor diversity understood opinions are more informed. Enjoy the caramels mild wood light peppery rye spices and ginger of this old-style 100% rye by a campfire or in a Highball. (Canada only) $27 CAD"
1904,3,"The nose is slow to open up and when it does it reveals simple rye spices and butterscotch. These become primary flavor notes on tasting. Biting spices burst onto a buttery palate before a pleasing bitterness seeps in. The second sip seems almost nutty and sweet with pralines and thick cream. This 10 year old blend of all-wheat and rye-grain whiskies is simple but displays its age with such subtleties as fading orange water and woodsy herbal notes. (Canada only) C$25"
1905,3,"Dry grain fills the air on first pour. This clear unaged whisky just gushes feed mill aromas. The all-wheat spirit is distilled from grain grown in a single Ontario field then coarse-milled for making whisky. Sweet creamy and oh so peppery hot it fades from citrus fruit and bitter black licorice to absolute nothingness. Our forefathers drank new make whisky. Let’s hope it was as tasty as this one. (Ontario & Washington DC only.) C$40/375 ml"
1906,3,"This entry-level Gibson’s is cut from the same fine cloth as the exquisite Gibson’s 18 and their lavishly flavorful 12 year old. Immediately rum and butter laced with spirit and hot pepper seep into sweet and sizzling rye spices. Then light berry-ish notes turn to Concord grapes pear juice and soft yellow apples as bitter walnut skins counter rich maple ice cream. A slight waxiness lends a satisfying weight. (Canada only)C$26"
1907,3,"The lush weighty mouthfeel of this affordable mixing whisky surprises as does the gently complex parade of ripe red cherries and plums Weetabix cereal dry green hay pencil shavings and blistering ginger root. There’s a lot of whisky here though it’s light and subtle. What burns in the mouth is slippery smooth in the throat ending in classic Canadian bitter grapefruit pith. Tasting suggestion: add ginger ale. A pleasing citron residue lingers in the empty glass."
1908,3,"Dusty on the nose with increasing caramel notes. A bit spirity. A semi-sweet palate with initially mild peppers flickers into a pleasing gingery glow. Suggestions of bitterness in the middle are subdued by increasing sweetness. Simple but very nice. Caramel notes quickly become hot and peppery then a smooth oiliness soothes the palate until it ends on a peppery and barely bitter finish. A great mixer with ginger ale."
1909,3,"It’s not whisky in Canada nor does it pretend to be. Canada’s three-year aging law keeps un-aged whisky off the market. So with no moonshine or firewater tradition Canada’s craft distillers must make their white spirits as palatable as the matured whiskies they could eventually become. The result is simple gingery and sweet with latent peppermint licorice and beer. The palate dissolves in a longish finish where sizzling pepper grows refreshingly bitter before fading to… nothingness. (Ontario only) C$37"
1910,11,"Slightly medicinal/mineral edge to a nose full of caramel. Hot in the mouth slick and sweet but with some currant and quince floating around; there’s more than a bit of youthful whiteness here. The finish stays hot and prickles the tongue a bit. A bold Canadian with some flaws but interesting nonetheless."
1911,9,"Richer sweeter (with more caramelized sugars) fruitier and spicier than the standard Canadian Mist (reviewed below). Still I wish it were a bit smoother (especially on the finish) for something I would consider drinking neat on a regular basis. There’s no age statement but a couple more years of aging would be nice. Like the flagship Canadian Mist this whisky still plays it fairly conservatively — not a lot of risk-taking here. But I think it’s slightly better than Crown Royal Black (its logical competitor) which is not as smooth on the finish and you can get Black Diamond for half the price."
1912,3,"Family-owned Domaine Pinnacle uses rye malted barley and corn spirits to create a lovely if typical Canadian blended whisky. Their 430-acre farm just a stone’s throw from the Vermont border in Quebec’s Eastern Townships produces award-winning apple cider too. Prune juice raspberries toffee hints of coffee; lush mild vegetal notes on the nose. Peppery sweet creamy and somewhat simple. Lovely burn. Traditional Canadian whisky with a bite. (Canada only) C$35"
1913,3,"A robust pleasing yet simple session whisky 1878 is made for mixing and shooting but not for contemplation. Wet stones with some sweetness on the nose predict the almost liqueur-like sweetness of the palate. It quickly becomes hot and zippy with a white pepper payload. Before long some slight bitter pithiness creeps in then subsides leaving crème brulée and Caramac candy bar with a rich almost eggy mouthfeel. The finish is short with cleansing grapefruit pith. (Canada only) C$19"
1914,3,"Very sweet butterscotch sultanas and smatterings of oak play off lime juice sweet and sour sauce and pulling citrus pith in a spirity but quintessentially smooth whisky. Creamy caramel shows hints of fudge that softens the crispness of freshly split red cedar shakes. Simple and tightly integrated. A sintering peppery heat quickly dominates the palate even as overripe fruits emerge in a finish that moves single-mindedly into a classic citric zest. A frisky mixer that is well worth sipping."
1915,3,"A simple straightforward session whisky. True North is rich in the classic caramel notes and searing pepper so coveted by shooters and tailgaters. Ginger and white pepper last seemingly forever. Given its undeniable drinkability packaging in a plastic bottle is probably a good idea. You can sip this if you wish but with ginger ale and a dash of bitters it becomes a Canadian Saturday night in a glass. A classic Canadian bottom-shelfer. (Canada only)"
1916,3,"The heritage grains movement influenced distiller Jesse Razaqpur at Toronto distillery to make whisky from an old-time Ontario variety called Red Fife. This hard red wheat contains less starch than the traditional soft wheat used for whisky making yielding less spirit. Red Fife wheat also contains flavor-inducing anthocyanins similar to red-grape flavenoids. Distinctive grain dust and slate-like mineral notes dominate the nose translating into searing hot pepper ripe red fruit and a slight sourness on the palate. (Distillery only) C$40/375 ml."
1917,9,"Not exactly black. (More like russet but Crown Royal Russet isn’t as catchy.) It’s nice to see the higher strength and there’s definitely more flavor here than the standard Crown Royal or Crown Royal Reserve. But it’s missing the smoothness and elegance I cherish in other Crown Royal whiskies. Notes of molasses and maple syrup accentuated by burnt fig hints of pedro ximenez sherry and raisin. There are suggestions of dark rum and bourbon in here. (Perhaps an alternative to both?) A whisky to drink on the rocks or as a mixer."
1918,3,"While their home-distilled whisky matures some dedicated craft whisky makers hone their blending skills using sourced whiskies to create blends such as this one. Caramel heated to the point of burning and oily freshly-roasted coffee with hints of real maple syrup gloriously overtake a spirity nose that betrays the youth of this simple no age statement work in progress. Scrumptious elements of clean oak burned lumber sawdust and earthy pineyness are beguiling but would benefit from tighter balance. (Saskatchewan only.) C$33"
1919,3,"A version of the classic Canadian Hunter from Sazerac this is a very enjoyable whisky for sipping on ice or with a simple mixer. A dry nose is a bit closed showing soft spirit caramel and hints of maple. The sweet hot and slightly pulling palate has a grapefruit juice sharpness that keeps it fresh. Maple syrup sweetens a hot longish finish that has the feel of black licorice. Simple fun whisky."
1920,3,"Prior to Prohibition Golden Wedding was a fine American whiskey. Decades later entrepreneur Louis Rosenstiel successfully revived the brand in Canada. The result shows hints of burnt toffee dusty rye dry grain and pickle juice. Earthy elements underscore river plants and citrus pith. Hot peppery spices bolster lively spirits while jammy fruit and floral overtones round out a straight-on mixer. A whisky that transforms ginger ale into ginger ale. (Canada only)C$24"
1921,11,"Hot solvents on the nose reminiscent of Hinkle’s Easter egg dyes. Heavy-handed sweet wash of caramel very hot cloying finish. Not easy to see this as related to the clean innocence of the standard expression."
1922,3,"Porridge butterscotch and a little dust on the nose. Rosewater and some spice on the palate but the floral notes are out of balance. Hot peppers slightly pulling and a bit mealy on the tongue then a pleasing earthiness. The label says “ultra premium” the taste says “not so much.” The best feature is the pepper which will bolster ginger ale and cut through cola because this is not really for sipping."
1923,3,"Rum—“screech” as it is called where it is made—is Newfoundland’s spirit of choice. With three shots of screech and a ceremony involving fish visitors are transformed into honorary Newfies. This 3 year old Amherst whisky custom blended for the Newfoundland Liquor Commission is ancient by comparison. It’s a basic mixer that arrives peppery hot with strong overtones of half-tamed spirit. Dusty wood lime peels and burnt toffee foretell a leisurely slide into refreshing bitterness. Definitely not screech. (Newfoundland only)  C$25"
1924,3,"The discontinued 10 year old CC Reserve was typical of the hard-rye genre with vanilla caramel ripe fruit and hot pepper stitched onto a flinty-firm base. This new 9 year old version though similar has obvious differences. Pleasing heat rides an initial surge of toffee dry grain and dried dark fruit. A soon-to-arrive pithiness on the shortish finish refreshes but without the familiar steeliness of its antecedent."
1925,3,"Minnesota is a favored destination for Canadian vacationers from the prairies and a hotbed for Canadian whisky. The Ellington Whisky Company calls Princeton (Minneapolis) home. Here it bottles whiskies imported from Canada. Where from exactly? A trade secret. Caramel prune juice ripe yellow fruits and hints of cooked buttery corn mute a dry spirity nose. Peppery and spicy it blends caramel bitter lemon soda sweet ginger and orange Fanta. Canadian whisky unlike any found in Canada. But do add cola. C$11"
1926,9,"There are three different Hirsch Canadian Whisky expressions: 8 10 and 12 years old. The 8 year old is my pick of the three with some creamy vanilla biscuit subtle caramel and a hint of honey. The alcohol is quite dominant and the finish unrefined with solvent-like notes. The 10 and 12 year olds express less flavor complexity and are somewhat harsh on the finish. They’re not good enough to drink neat or on the rocks and too expensive to drink as a mixer ($38 for the 10 year old; $44 for the 12 year old.). Rating for the 10 year old: 72; rating for the 12 year old: 70."
1927,9,"Very light in aroma and flavor. There are no off flavors. It’s just uninspiring. Delicate notes of vanilla custard honey caramel corn sweet corn and subtle fruit. Fleeting finish."
1928,3,"The loyalty to Canadian Leaf shown by some rye-and-coke drinkers in the Northeastern border states speaks to the broad appeal of whisky in general. With creamy caramel toffee sweet burnt sugar and a pleasant spice-fired warmth it makes a great mixing whisky. A certain sharpness and spirity overtones render it less interesting as a sipper. Simple flawless and well-executed but not particularly exciting this is the light Canadian whisky of yesteryear."
1930,3,"A tad thin for sipping Five Star is a quintessential mixing whisky laden with dusty rye and citrus pith; it begs for ginger ale. First though sip it neat and feel it blossom in your mouth; it brims with spirit caramel and blistering pepper. Behind these linger orange zest herbaceous tones creamy corn and refreshing bitterness. Tingling rye spices that play off the pepper perk up its sweet fruitiness. Now mix it and delight in its straightforward simplicity. (Canada only) C$22"
1931,3,"Maple syrup and gelatin capsules in a veterinarian’s office. Texas Spirit is WB Liquors’ (Costco) house brand and so available in one size only: extra-large. A simple mixing whisky it is sweet floral watery and loaded with vanilla and caramel. Extra hot pepper throws it a bit out of balance though it would likely go well with Coke. A young unassuming whisky not to savor but to session. Price is per 1.75 liter."
1932,3,"Traces of burnt caramel add interest to an otherwise simple overly sweet palate. A triumvirate of alcohol chocolate toffee and pepper. A slight bitterness is more distracting than pleasing or refreshing. Reminiscent of Aunt Jemima pancake syrup Sailboat is just too sweet to sip solo but adding ginger ale increases the complexity as spirit and sweetness mingle with ginger and carbonation. It would benefit from a bit more wood. A very inexpensive whisky though not a bargain. $20 CAD"
1933,11,"It does say “whisky” on the label...followed by “with natural cinnamon flavor.” It's clear from the first sniff that this is a one-trick pony: hot fiery cinnamon. But is there whisky flavor in there? Fireball's as sweet as the liqueur proof would indicate and as hot as advertised and there's only a hint of whisky character under the fire. A novelty for tailgating; probably great in hot chocolate."
1934,3,"With its overt floral perfume notes and the scent of children’s powdered candy this whisky is difficult to enjoy. Its unctuous artificial flavors are equally unsuitable for cocktails mixing or sipping. Fruity winey lavender notes duke it out with baby cereal and artificial coconut. The saving graces? A late lovely bitterness long gingery burn and creamy body. But then jujubes grape gum and artificial bananas kick in and it’s over."
1935,12,"Earthy smoky and sweet with aromas of chili-dusted dried mango barbecue potato chips brown sugar mesquite smoke and fruit-flavored pipe tobacco as well as pinesap and leather. Hefty in weight with powerful oak and earthy flavors including tobacco leaf espresso bean mesquite-grilled meat and orange. There are roasted nuts minerality dark chocolate and cigar wrapper on the finish. Add water generously without any fear of diluting this benevolent bruiser."
1936,10,"Master distiller Douglas French unveils the single-barrel results of his latest heritage corn experiments: a dry and spicy nose with graham cracker cornbread red licorice buttered corncobs and a cloud of spices. It’s a big mouthful with flavors of fruit concentrate red bell pepper baked orange clove star anise peppercorn and toffee with the spices congregating around the tip of the tongue then a slightly vegetal finish."
1937,10,"This single-barrel release made from an attractive heritage corn has herbal notes of dill cilantro stalks and hints of tarragon with green melon boiled corn and dried apple. Sipping it begins with a fruity palate of citrus raspberry and green fruits which are joined by dill ginger root pepper and a touch of bitterness. A hot and spicy finish with remnants of unsweetened fruit."
1938,12,"A polarizing nose of tropical fruit (papaya mango melon) drenched in butterscotch vies with the distinct aroma of tennis shoes on asphalt. The palate is hot dry and somewhat ashy with billowing smoke tobacco leaf and nuttiness undercut by lime and orange oil. Drying and oak-driven on the finish it’s sweetened by the addition of water."
1939,5,"Used cooperage and higher corn content make corn whiskey its own category and Mellow Corn is its leader. As expected corn dominates throughout as salty chip tortilla and my favorite a thick corn pudding. Burnt brown sugar vanilla and black pepper spice tingle the senses too. This is a sipper if you really like corn but you can’t drink this and think bourbon."
1940,11,"An authoritative nose: deep oak structure cracked corn warehouse reek. Minty and lively but deep and almost ponderous at the same time and not anywhere near as hot as expected. A bare hint of mustiness (which a bit of water helps wash out) keeps it from being truly exceptional but this verges on greatness. A show-stopper."
1941,7,"Although the Prichard distillery is located in Lincoln County it has a special exemption from using the Lincoln County Process and isn’t charcoal filtered.  The nose reflects that with bright aromas including caramel cinnamon and oak. The entry is sweet caramel corn followed by soft cinnamon and black pepper with a boost from some oak. A medium slightly dry finish completes a very flavorful but still extremely easy-drinking Tennessee whiskey. This is the crown jewel of the Prichard distillery line."
1942,2,"This blend of Scotch whisky and Virginia Distilling’s own-make whisky is finished in cider casks for 8 to 20 months and has layers of flavor. There’s light peat campfire and fragrant meadow on the nose along with sweeter notes of vanilla coulis applesauce marzipan pears and cinnamon-spiced almonds. The palate offers polished oak clementine grilled apple and almond pudding. A lengthy finish adds brown sugar grilled fruit dark chocolate espresso and white pepper."
1943,12,"Autumn in a glass: dried apples earthy leaves marzipan grilled pears and white pepper mingle with lemon-herb tea saline and a whiff of incense. Malty with a pleasant oiliness the palate showcases lemon peel juicy clementine poached pears grilled apples chamomile salt water taffy and a delicate perfumed savoriness—almonds in rice pilaf. Complex and balanced with a lengthy oak finish. Virginia Distillery Co. combines its own single malt with blended malt from the Highlands of Scotland. Batch 2 of Cider Cask Finished scored 90 points indicating strong consistency. Number 13 in the 2018 Top 20"
1944,0,"Subtle and rounded smoke on the nose balanced by lemon grilled pineapple and chocolate-chip cookie dough. A big tannic and chewy palate chocolaty and extremely fruity—hints of Meyer lemon grilled plums walnut paste and five-alarm chili wrapped in a thick spicy smoke. A fiery finish benefits from water. Their first peated release and it’s a showstopper. (531 bottles; distillery only)"
1945,2,"Orange banana and nutmeg lead on the nose along with a subtle note of cigar box. A smooth chocolaty palate melds with maple syrup caramel allspice and more tobacco. Water brings out heat and more spiciness with orange and chocolate notes reprising on a long finish. The ABV here is lower than most barrel-proof whiskeys but make no mistake: this one can stand up to the best of them."
1962,12,"Malty and biscuity aromas mingle seamlessly with vanilla plums raisins and chocolate-covered bananas. The Highland scotch in the blend asserts itself with dry graininess and a floral character bordering on potpourri but is well-balanced with cooked plum and pear chocolate ginger and Fig Newton. Nuttiness and a bit of ash round out a pleasantly bitter-sweet finish that shows impressive length."
1946,7,"Many distilleries have released bourbon finished in a second barrel but it’s Prichard’s who was savvy enough to copyright the term “double barreled.”  As you’d expect the nose is big oak blending darker more seasoned oak with lighter new oak. The palate is unexpectedly balanced with lush sweet caramel in perfect sync with spicy oak black pepper clove and cinnamon. That wonderful balance follows through to a medium finish that doesn’t leave you feeling like you’ve been chewing on a barrel."
1947,8,"A sourced whiskey of 95% corn finished in wine barrels from winemaker Dave Phinney. This makes a super first impression with Bit-O-Honey candy eucalyptus black cherry cinnamon hearts violet candies and sandalwood. The flavors pour layered and complex with clove-studded orange flickers of rye spice and pure crystalline sweetness balanced with lemony lift. Laser-like spice sweet caramel corn and more floral notes dance across the long finish."
1948,2,"This blend of bourbons includes 11 year old and 18 year old liquid finished in armagnac sherry and cognac casks. Toasted oak cinnamon apples clove blueberries and vanilla cake on the nose followed by a palate of chocolate cream pie brown sugar and more apple cinnamon and blueberry. Long and rich on a silky finish with a final note of tobacco leaf atop chocolate cinnamon and cherry. A whiskey that combines power and finesse."
1949,2,"Sweet scents of maple syrup creamy vanilla caramel and rich chocolate start things off enlivened by notes of pepper orange peel and bread spice. A chewy palate tastes of dark chocolate cherries and plums cinnamon and layered spices of ginger white pepper cinnamon and cloves. A similarly spicy finish is balanced by plums and berries dark chocolate and oak. A balanced dessert-like whiskey with beautiful sweet notes and much more."
1950,8,"Peerless Distilling’s first whiskey in nearly a century; at 2 years old it’s precocious. Captivating on the nose; fruit-driven with orange peach nectar melded with vanilla custard and nice details of clove and nutmeg. The palate pours big and bold bursting with fruit alcohol and a face slap of spicy peppery rye. While it’s a touch hot the reveal of 53.7% makes this forgivable. A generous splash of water unleashes more flavor baking spice and aniseed on the finish."
1951,11,"Cask-strength rye made from Arkansas-grown grain aged 26 months. Must be a small barrel; it’s quite dark. Nose of crushed rye grain well-polished oak furniture and moist rye bread. Swift and certain in the mouth: dense chewy flavors of rye bread sweet and full and bitter crackling with oak spice and drawing to a sizzling finish. I do like a small distiller whiskey that knows where it’s going. Very impressive."
1952,8,"A beautiful rye nose of clove spice sandalwood incense warm cinnamon toast and vanilla sugar leads to a palate that is both creamy and juicy with abundant apricot orchard and citrus fruit; the citrus smacks of ruby-red grapefruit with its hint of bitterness. Shows a good bit of heat and power as the seamless flavors and well-integrated spice coast through a long finish. The first bottling to include High West’s own-make spirit. Tasted blind against previous batches."
1953,12,"Harmonious and symphonious throughout starting with the nose of cooked cherries sarsaparilla spearmint clove cinnamon dill maple syrup tobacco leaf and loads of oak. The chewy broad palate yields bowls full of cherries and blueberry jam along with roasted peanuts dark chocolate white pepper spearmint oil cinnamon and dried chili. There’s more chili bittersweet chocolate dried blueberries and lengthy oak to finish."
1954,7,"An American single malt whiskey that brings together the sensibilities of American craft with traditional Scottish and Irish styles with great result. Hogshead’s nose is bright and acidic with pear apple maple cinnamon and malted grain. The palate is much spicier than expected but enjoyably so with black pepper oak cinnamon and clove mixing well with honeyed malt and pear. The finish is long and slightly dry with a dash of heat. An impressive entry in the craft category."
1955,7,"A malted rye whiskey aged in new bourbon and Germain-Robin cognac barrels. Cereal grains are the star of this nose which supports the rye grain with oak and cinnamon spice. The palate follows the grain-focused nose and is a carefully crafted love note to rye grain featuring multi-grain cereal cinnamon ginger sawdust and a touch of oak. The finish is all dark chocolate rye grain and cinnamon spice; a delicious close to expertly-crafted whiskey."
1956,2,"This wheat whiskey from Bainbridge Island in Washington State is finished 8 to12 months in barrels that previously held Islay Scotch whisky for 10 to 12 years. The nose offers cedar beach bonfire smoke and kelp along with roasted pineapple apples and pepper. There’s more smoke sea and salinity on the palate as well as meatier flavors of grilled sausage and leather and the finish shows sweeter notes of caramel walnut and chocolate."
1957,2,"This Jos. A. Magnus & Co. release marries 18 year old and 11 year old bourbon with 9 year old light whiskey. Rich oak on a nose that offers butterscotch vanilla ice cream and sugared pecans along with red fruit baking spice and black pepper. The palate reveals more vanilla as well as almonds honey toffee and gingerbread. Chocolate baking spice pepper leathery oak and tobacco leaf complete a long sinewy finish that shows its maturity well."
1958,7,"Aged for 4 years and bottled in bond this bourbon has a mash of Arkansas grown grains including 73% corn 9% wheat and 18% barley. Dark amber in color a robust nose spotlights cinnamon oak and black pepper. The palate is an enjoyable journey from sweet caramel corn to spicy cinnamon and oak. Cinnamon is the star in the mid-palate where it’s well supported by the underlying alcohol. A long and slightly dry finish caps off a craft whiskey done right."
1959,11,"Distilled from Bear Republic Big Bear Black Stout alambic pot distilled aged 29 months in used French oak. Gooey nose with lots of dark chocolate toffee fruit (ripe honeydew Asian pear red plum); no hint of the 49.5% ABV heat. Deliciously layered palate: dry malt juicy fruit and savory wood spice sweet malt and chocolate and a finish that’s sweet light and quite refreshing and inviting. Lives up to the Charbay hype!"
1960,8,"Generously oaked with toasty oak drive delivering brown spices and earthy dried apple on the nose. The palate pours sweet and rich with warm corn porridge underscored with dark molasses and maple flavors. There is a lot to like here from the boiled peanuts to a spiced palate as the young house-made whiskey imparts its verve to the 9 year old Indiana bourbon."
1961,12,"Sweet smoke mingles with lemon curd milk chocolate roasted marshmallow and vanilla-frosted yellow cupcake on the nose. The palate has a rubbery peatiness yet the flavor remains fresh with cherries and grapes roasted nuts salted caramel and milk chocolate. It all wraps up with the ashiness of pipe tobacco and lengthy saline minerality. Beguiling and moreish—a whiskey worth lingering over. (3000 bottles)"
1963,11,"Dad’s Hat rye has evolved like many craft whiskeys but they’re still bottling at 6 to 9 months (another label is planned for a straight version). That’s working well. The nose is rip-roaring rye: crushed grain grass sweet spice bitter herbal notes with all the complexity of the grain. Delivers honestly on the tongue too plus a light barrel character proceeding to an integrated finish. Excellent young rye there’s no mistaking the mother grain."
1964,11,"WHACK! The spicy smack of the nose sends me to check the mashbill; sure enough this is 38% rye. The nose fumes with youthful zest: cinnamon bright mint sun-warmed green grass. Pour some on the palate for more explosive entertainment; sweet cinnamon red-hots burst corn pops and the oak burns on into the rye-high finish. This is one excitable boy of a bourbon and it’s got me humming along. Impressive."
1965,2,"Vanilla frosting on the nose contrasts with notes of dried flowers as well as lime orange and a floral back note. The palate offers more citrus along with brown sugar. The finish is smooth and balanced with dark chocolate and bitter espresso notes hitting home in counterbalance. The flavor opens up with water revealing a hint of coconut before a long finish of chocolate and baked apple."
1966,8,"This high-end whiskey exhibits restrained oak elegance and delicateness with wonderful poached pear cereal crème caramel floral and lemon chiffon cake aromas that yield to a bright beam of tart mouthwatering citrus—clementine lemon and yuzu—tingling with allspice. Bright light and lively but not lacking in complexity finishing with marshmallow toasted almond and marzipan. Very pretty! American single grain whiskey aged in Japanese Mizunara oak casks."
1967,8,"A lovely balance of oak clove and sweetness come together on the nose while the flavor shows both big impact and refinement. Oak-driven in style with plenty of tannins and tobacco leaf but the sweetness and structure stand up pouring flavors of pecan caramelized nuts and toasted spices with hints of pine before the persistent finish. A very solid and nicely polished bourbon."
1968,2,"The nose has a bright note of lime as well as dried herbs including coriander parsley and dill. Bonfire smoke and charred oak are in the mix along with rich caramel. The palate blends sweet vanilla and toffee with smoked wood apples peanut shells and a peppery spice embellishing the background. The finish is dark chocolate espresso peanut brittle and more charred oak along with a lingering pleasant cigar aftertaste."
1969,2,"Quite herbal on the nose with aromas of dried tarragon parsley and dill along with cherry milk chocolate orange blossom vanilla bean and sweet tea. The palate is slightly grain-forward but is full and well balanced with orange dried flowers chamomile tea lemon rind and ginger. The finish offers cinnamon and milk chocolate against a note of candied lemon. Youthful and barrel-influenced but admirably executed."
1970,12,"Fresh and delicate on the nose with stone fruit—especially peaches—white pepper orange Creamsicle and spice. A generous oak backbone provides the foundation for plums nectarines black pepper clove chamomile tea and piney cedar that sweeps into a dry oak cocoa iced-tea finish. Although a bit hot at times the balance and array of flavors is an outstanding coup for this young distillery."
1971,12,"This blend of bourbons (both sourced and house-made) is partly finished in PX sherry casks and that influence makes itself known through aromas of candied pecans honey raisins figs oranges and white pepper along with cigar wrapper rose petal and some minerality. The palate is replete with roasted corn dried dates candied almonds oranges raspberry-jam cookies cinnamon bark and plenty of oak—a flavorful and elegant combination with silky mouthfeel and good balance."
1972,11,"Solid chunky bottle with idiosyncratic whiskey inside. Straightforward rye crisps out of the glass in no-nonsense style; dry grain sweet grass and light but insistent anise almost wholly drown out the
barrel character. The mouth is as dry and spicy-medicinal as the nose hints at laying down character like a winning hand: rye SNAP! heat SNAP! light tarragon SNAP! oak SNAP! and a warm wrap-up finish SNAP! Full house flavors over sensations. Clean and interesting. Nicely played."
1973,11,"One of the debut whiskeys at WhiskyFest New York 2012 this was finished in a barrel that held Virginia-made port…after it was used to age Bowman whiskey a boomerang finish. The nose gives baking chocolate tropical flowers and yes some of that port. Peppery and port-edged on the tongue solid fire from the 100 proof fat corn and fruit in the middle of the palate. Busy but purposeful. There’s a lot here and it’s all working together."
1974,11,"Triple-distilled whiskey from Samuel Adams Cinder Bock beer aged 3.5 years in Samuel Adams Utopias casks. Definite character of strong beer to the nose very light smoke some mixed fruit notes. Mellow smoke on the tongue broad malt and fruit (prune plum dried cherry baked apple) a luxurious feel. Finish is slow and even. Flavorful but not heavy or shouting. The casks have had a great effect here but the distilling is skillfully done."
1975,5,"One of the first non-Kentucky bonded bourbons since the 1950s. There’s trepidation in this glass. Floral pear peach and chocolate tickle the nose leading to relief that its aroma isn’t over-oaked like some smaller distillers’ bourbons. Apricot meets dark chocolate mint and smoked corn with hints of caramel walnut shell and a long chicory-coffee finish. The taste is definitely not Kentucky but is convincingly delicious especially the bitter notes toward the end. Taste this lineage; something special is starting."
1976,7,"It’s hard to stand out in a sea of fairly bland moonshine but Manhattan Moonshine manages to by moving beyond corn in their mashbill with oat rye spelt and malt. The result is an unaged whiskey that’s light slightly sweet and a symphony of cereal grains. The addition of the honey note from the oats is spot on and helps unite the grain flavors. A dash of spice creates balance and drives a dry finish. This is a wonderfully crafted and unique whiskey."
1977,12,"Delicate floral and sweet aromas—peach blossom honeysuckle fresh apricot milk chocolate and nougat—commingle with earthy herbaceous notes: espresso bean log pile clay. The palate is light-bodied but doesn’t shortchange on flavor with vanilla cookie apricots hazelnuts in milk chocolate apple blossom and salted light caramels. Take your time with this whiskey—it’s mature in flavor if not in barrel age and it needs room to unfold its many intriguing layers."
1978,11,"Made from roasted Hopi blue corn. The nose says bourbon—sweet corn faint maple—but with big notes of stone fruits. It's lush. Mouth veers off in another direction with floury corn oaked complexity an herbal component like crushed stems of wildflowers and cinnamon/allspice notes. The finish is suddenly mellow with a seductive creaminess high in the back palate. Even at a young 50% never really fiery. Wonderfully complex and not over-oaked; beautiful stuff."
1979,12,"Heady tropical aromas swirl out of the glass: orange peel guava hibiscus sandalwood cedar and cinnamon. Fruit—papaya nectarine blueberry citrus and grape—shows up in force on the palate as well tempered by oak and milk chocolate pistachios and dried flowers. The finish is long and gently spiced with soft oak cedar and cocoa flavors. Distillery 291 bottles all its rye as single-barrel batches of about 55-60 bottles each."
1980,12,"The name should give some indication: this is a big brawny whiskey. Aromas of orange peel iced tea toasted coconut peanut honey and molasses spar with grain and dry firewood. The palate delivers oak more grain orange oil menthol roasted nuts iced tea cherries and cola. Tobacco leathery oak and bitter chocolate tie everything together on the finish which is especially enjoyable with a few drops of water added."
1981,11,"Rye spice is the first thing on the nose: cinnamon-spiked hard candy hot and juicy. Beautifully oily and bitter rye character slides across the tongue on a wave of sweet caramel and vanilla. Young but in the eager intensity of rye not the clumsy heat of bourbon. Rye shines here from the first whiff to the last bitter curl on the tongue and the wood deftly sweetens and soothes. Nicely done."
1982,11,"Bitter oily medicinally minty rye in the nose and a pleasant undercurrent of oaky vanilla. Brisk hot rye mixes furiously with wood notes pear and berry esters and a light grainy sweetness; a madly busy whiskey that’s quite fun on the palate. The finish is minty and grassy wrapped in oak but somewhat quick. Interesting and delicious."
1983,8,"Nuts plum dried red fruits plump berries and oak on the nose while the palate pours lush and fruity with a sherry-like quality with pot still richness. Cigar wrapper wet walnuts and pine emerge to ride the wave of vanilla soft malt and spice-laced baked fruits. Offers the fruity allure of a Speyside malt coupled with American bravado for a long resinous and fruity finish."
1984,7,"This bourbon is a blend of whiskeys aged a minimum of 5 years with part of that time spent in California's Central Coastal hills. Breaker leads with a strong oak nose supported by cinnamon and caramel. On the palate the maritime impact is there: it’s softer and less oaky with a good balance of cinnamon caramel and a touch of clove. Breaker is a very restrained and understated bourbon but that’s also what makes it so damn likable. Sourced whiskey."
1985,11,"This is 8 year old 100% rye Canadian whisky that Fremont Mischief distillery imports and bottles. Congratulations are due: the rye spice-vanilla aromas are strongly similar to their younger own-make whiskey reviewed below. The extra age shows: this is Canadian-mellow not a fiery American rye even at 45%. All the spice is there and the floral/grassy complexity but there are more rich oak notes and a high arching finish that sustains the whiskey on the palate."
1986,11,"This Dry Fly Distilling project is made from grains grown in Washington by farmer Tim O'Danaher [note that different spellings are correct]. Off to a good start: a luxuriously sweet cereal aroma puffs out of the glass as I pour and adds softened dried fruits and hard candy when actively nosed. The new American oak (53-gallon barrel) is evident immediately tempering the sweetness with spice walnuts and a hard woodiness. Finish is long balanced enticing. Definitely enjoyable as a sipper; an interesting new direction."
1987,11,"New York Distilling's 3 year old rye is made with a 72/16/12% mashbill (rye/corn/malt) and aged in 53-gallon barrels. The rye is organic and non-GMO. Nose is clean rich with grassy bitter rye aroma and a nice dash of mint. Mouth is smooth but assertive: bitter-minty a bit oily and the wood arrives near the end. Quite nicely balanced delivers what a rye should and would make an excellent cocktail as well."
1988,8,"An aroma you can really chew on this comes at you big and bold its dried cherry fig and caramel flavors woven with pipe tobacco licorice and saddle leather. The jolt of sweetness and spice on the palate pour on and on. Water helps to temper the heat and release even more flavors with currant chocolate and drying oak on the finish. Sourced Indiana bourbon finished in oloroso sherry Pedro Ximenez and Cognac casks."
1989,8,"Delicate floral sweet and reminiscent of a Lowland malt with its Creamsicle nose. Flavors of papaya bright citrus and green tea are nicely balanced with the perfect touch of smoke on the pleasingly oily palate while the long finish smacks of baked apples cocoa and minerality. Wonderfully balanced and moreish this is a happy marriage of Scotch whisky and Virginia single malt whiskey finished in a cask that previously held Wee Heavy style beer. (1500 bottles)"
1990,2,"Peach blueberry candied raspberry and lime lead the way with marzipan and a background of peppery spice aromas set artfully against soft subtle wood. A mouth-filling palate offers lemon and raspberry along with ginger cinnamon chocolate and honey. Water coaxes tropical notes of melon and pineapple. The finish is peppery with caramel and chocolate flowing over pleasant oak overtones. A rye that strikes an excellent balance between fruit sweetness and spice."
1991,2,"Black pepper and toasted oak on the nose mingle with deeper aromas of blackcurrant and strawberry preserves. The palate is smooth showing flavors of vanilla bean coconut peppermint and cinnamon. Dark chocolate emerges on the back palate along with pepper and tobacco leaf. The finish is long revealing maple syrup caramel and brown sugar. Five years of aging have created a solid well-constructed bourbon that has impressive depth and complexity."
1992,8,"There is a freshness to the wood on the nose laced with caramel and delicate minty notes. The palate pours pleasantly chewy with molten butterscotch and offers a pleasant jolt of cinnamon and clove that suggests rye at work before settling on bitter orange peel salted caramel and cocoa leading to a drying leathery and warm spice finish. Nicely done."
1993,11,"Three batches of malt smoked separately with peat cherry wood and beech. The nose is Islay-reminiscent peat with some beech bacon under it but the top is all cherry; very rewarding. For all the nose the mouth is relatively mild; mostly juicy malt up front then opening to the peat fire in the middle the beech crowding around the sides and the cherry floating overtop like a good pipe tobacco. Smooth smoky finish. Compelling."
1994,11,"The .36 Small Caliber was one of the best young small-barrel bourbons I’ve ever had so I was very much looking forward to this 3 year 8 month old bottling from “traditional large barrels.” Aroma: like a 12 year old bourbon: oak spice corn sweet. Not hot spice and vanilla smooth but oaky with a light flowing feel. A unique combination of youth and maturity that opens the “Texas whiskey” niche a bit wider. (Spec’s exclusive)"
1995,11,"3 year old peated malt whisky aged in Oregon oak. Rich nose of peat—burning leaves a touch of sweet diesel—and fresh oak. There's no stinting on the peat; it's young it's in your face. Whiskey to stand toe-to-toe with Portland's hopped-to-blazes beers. Not just peat: creamy malt makes a solid floor and an exit that may be the most complex part of the experience. Refined for a 3 year old. Limited annual release."
1996,0,"Distilled from roasted blue corn. The spirit itself not the grain is smoked over Texas scrub oak. Spicy Red Vines herbal notes and blackened corn aromas. An initial burst of fire on the palate transforms into juicy red fruit sweet cinnamon apple and hints of bramble and forest floor. An unusual and polarizing whiskey Brimstone is aggressive at first but in the end it’s a gentle giant."
1997,2,"The nose begins with notes of cinnamon soft oak cardamom white pepper and a hint of new wood. The palate shifts to a subtle blend of orange and vanilla. Water reveals fresh raspberry along with notes of fresh herbs roasted almonds tobacco leaf and more new wood. The finish is powerful and complex leading with vanilla and more nuttiness as well as red fruit and roasted pineapple."
1998,0,"Mesquite-smoked single malt from Arizona. Very rich and aromatic dripping with barbecue sauce paprika juicy red apple and smoked bacon on the nose. A full panoply of barbecue flavors on the palate—brisket roast chicken ribs. Cayenne walnuts and spiced ginger balanced with oranges apples and pears. Some tar and creosote notes. Juicy meaty and smoky all at the same time. The herbal vegetative notes are intriguing but can be divisive."
1999,8,"It would be easy to hate on this as bourbon but taken merely as a whiskey it’s compelling original and surprisingly well-knit. The nose betrays the smoke and sea of its Islay cask finish while the palate offers more sweet vanilla candied nuts and citrus before circling back with distinct vegetal notes of seaweed and jalapeño. Perhaps bourbon is in the eye of the beholder."
2000,8,"While the aroma is tightly wound at first it gradually reveals layers of brown sugar and warming spice apple and pear fruits woven through with opulent toasted oak. The palate entry is soft and rounded but quickly picks up steam with layers of biscuity malt peppercorns blackberry fruit and a lovely salted butter note that brings nice balance to the finish. Fully mature pleasingly complex and it keeps getting better!"
2001,9,"Malt whisky from the Scottish Highlands finished in Virginia in Virginia wine casks. A potpourri of red fruit (raspberry currant cherry) tangerine caramel honey and marzipan. Polished leather tobacco and oak on the finish. The port influence smooths out the rough edges nicely and adds depth to this youthful lively whisky. (Loch & K(e)y exclusive)"
2002,8,"The quality is instantly discernable even as the rye grain takes a back seat to layered aromas of cherry and dark currant coupled with sweet notes of brown sugar and treacle underscored by fresh oak toasted spices and dark chocolate. Beyond its richness and depth this beams bright and lively on the palate as grapefruit zest meets rye bread followed by a finish of harmonized sweetness and spice. Aged 3 years in American oak; finished in French oak. (Distillery only)"
2003,11,"This 100% rye whiskey was distilled at Fremont Mischief and aged in oak. The flinty-minty rye spice blows right out at you with a ripple of oaky vanilla. Beautiful youthful rye spirit with crackling rye spiciness sweet floral notes and hints of horehound candy. The finish is a bit disappointing — fading somewhat quickly — but mainly because the rest of it's so good. Great price for mellowness in this category too."
2004,11,"Clear and unaged in a tall thin grappa-like 375 ml bottle; “Afterburner” is a bit intimidating as a name. “Distilled from grain and fermented with hops.” Nose of new make and hops with aromas of rhubarb and fresh blood. Herbal and refreshing on the palate bitter with the hops a certain resiny stickiness to it. Much more than just new make; almost tonic-like. Nicely done!"
2005,8,"An intriguing nose of campfire smoke drapes the distinctive aroma of mesquite charcoal dark toast with honey and pretty floral notes. On the palate the blast of initial sweetness gets swept up in burnt matchsticks peppery heat and wood tannins. A bit hot on the finish. This is a big in-your-face meaty whiskey that any barbecue brisket fan will relish."
2006,2,"Part of Breuckelen Distilling’s Bonded Series this rye starts with fresh wood and some candied fruit on the nose as well as vanilla frosting lemon and cigar wrapper. The palate is somewhat oak-driven with emerging fruit flavors of peach apricot and juicy orange. A strong finish has notably good length and reveals more flavors of dark chocolate raspberries blueberries black cherries licorice and gentle wood spices."
2007,2,"This porter-style 100% malted barley single malt has a nose of dark chocolate and coffee beans that’s also slightly herbal with a note of wood and a subtle pleasant sweetness. Toasted oak leads on the palate with sugared espresso cinnamon dried flowers and an ashy back note. More coffee chocolate and coconut punctuate the finish. Aged at least 2 years this whiskey is surprisingly complex considering its relative youth and is quite unique."
2008,2,"Fresh wood pine forest and grassy meadow greet you on the nose—followed by lemon coriander and some warmer notes of ginger and shortbread. The palate is sweet with chocolate caramel hints of almond licorice cinnamon and clove balanced against notes of anise pine nuts dill and black pepper. The finish is punctuated by polished oak and spiced chocolate. This craft expression is youthful but is also dynamic and complex."
2009,2,"This whiskey is made from four separate mashbills of malt wheat oats and rye and aged in oak for 12 to 36 months. There’s a subtle spiciness on the nose as well as lemon orange peel and a hint of sandalwood. The palate has notes of rice pudding maple syrup malt chocolate and honey. A lengthy finish is completed with cinnamon chocolate coffee baking spice and a touch of pepper."
2010,2,"This bourbon from South Carolina’s Charleston Distilling Co. has a nose that starts with a chalky minerality but fruit leather strawberry and blueberry quickly emerge along with notes of candy corn caramel and chocolate fondue. The palate offers bitter chocolate grape and cherry with caramel roasted nuts and coconut lingering on the back palate. The finish is nutty and bittersweet with lingering fruitiness on a warm and chocolaty finish."
2011,2,"This high-rye expression (75% rye) has a nose of citrus dried tea leaves and a fennel note rounded out by a pleasant sweetness that’s laced with Christmas cake cocoa clove and cinnamon. The palate is rich chocolate balanced by citrus oil nutmeg walnut and white pepper. The finish is warm silky and full. Well integrated balanced and sophisticated this whiskey is elegant beyond its age."
2012,11,"This one’s calling to me; I can smell the rich nose from a foot away. Freshly-sieved cornmeal sharp oak aromas and spice cake in the nose. Good body a bit warm (expected from the proof) and a mouthful of
cracked corn piecrust sun-warmed meadow-mint and vanilla. Finish is firm and leaner than the mouth drawn out nicely. Belle Meade is currently sourced from MGP; Green Brier hopes to have their distillery up this year."
2013,11,"“Local heirloom rye grains” are distilled (less than half a mile from the Monongahela River) in a copper alembic aged 14 months bottled at cask strength. Has a beautiful ruddy glow. Clean focused nose of fresh rye grain spicy-sweet with a nip of bitter oil in the back. Not a barn-burner even at 56% but brimful with rye spice rye oiliness and rye mint and not over-oaked either as the finish closes evenly. A bit direct but very nicely done!"
2014,11,"Sweet warm grassy like a sunny day on the prairie. The alcohol heat quickly yields to a grass/mint sweetness—this is high-rye stuff—that picks up some oily rye notes as it slides into a finish that is both bitter and sweet without being bittersweet; the components remain discrete not blending. Quite nice and reasonably priced. Sourced whiskey (with the 95% rye mashbill that’s an LDI/MGP signature)."
2015,8,"Lovely aromas of charred toast nut bread biscuits fresh grain rye spice and some grassiness give way to a palate-coating sweetness including malted milk balls cocoa and dark baking chocolate. The finish offers fine balance with cherry fruit nicely matched with drying oak tannins and laced with sandalwood and spices. Vatted from 23 barrels primarily bourbon and rye though the malt component offers great backbone."
2016,11,"Made with green malt: not kilned taken just as it’s ready from malting to be fermented and distilled timing that accounts for some of the price and limited availability of this unique spirit. Smells like a shed full of drying herbs and flowers; vegetal souls transmigrated to the bottle. Herbal European restrained barrel character headily vaporous in the mouth. An invigorating elixir I’d like to keep handy in a small flask; a little goes a long way. Fascinatingly different. Price is per 375 ml."
2017,11,"Coppersea uses New York grain (75% rye 25% malt) mashed in wooden tanks and distilled in direct-fire copper pot stills. This unaged spirit is highly aromatic: hay sunny meadow hints of lavender and tansy honeydew melon. Brilliantly herbal flavors sweet grass gobs of white pepper lemon balm and a long-lingering sweet heat. Almost more like an eau de vie than a whiskey with layer upon layer to discover. Heretical thought: this might be wasted on a barrel."
2018,11,"Now here’s an interesting mashbill: 73% malted rye 13.5% chocolate malt and 13.5% cherry-smoked malt. Nose is an arresting mix of bitter grassy rye and smoky dark chocolate; abrupt but it grows on you. It’s all there on the palate too: rye oil sweet malt cherry smoke pipe tobacco raw oak. This is rambunctious stuff with an intense but not hot finish a very craft-beer whiskey. Unlike similarly shouty bottlings this one has something to say as it shouts."
2019,8,"The concentration here is impressive as dates and raisins meet leathery oak that smells of a dusty tack shop joined by some lovely cinnamon clove and spearmint. The intensity on the rich palate is face-melting hot and muscular. Sweet flan caramel corn and vivid spice succumb to a finish built for oak lovers drying and a bit tannic bringing the molten sweet flavors to an end too soon."
2020,8,"Pretty violet and floral notes lead the way with herb garden and chocolaty oak draped over caramel chews. The creamy palate offers marshmallow and a candy store mélange of Jolly Ranchers and Swedish Fish before the finely balanced oak comes in meeting the sweetness with sandalwood and rye spice. A lovely effort that places balance above sheer power."
2021,8,"With 4 years 3 months of age this is a fine selection with poached pear stone fruit brown sugar and floral aromas nicely integrated. At cask strength it serves up a bold and spicy punch to the palate with peppery notes that quickly overpower the dried corn treacle and caramel sweetness. A little water allows that sweetness to shine through before the slightly tannic finish of drying oak and black walnut. (Lincoln Road Package Store exclusive)"
2022,9,"A blend of bourbon rye and peated single malt Scotch whiskies. This is an adaptation of the original release that spent additional time in Hungarian and French oak barrels. The finishing produces a creamier smoother more rounded more mature and improved version of Campfire showing notes of honey vanilla dark berries soft mint and smoke. Distinctive and unique."
2023,11,"NJOY Spirits makes this 100% rye from locally-grown rye some of which they grow themselves…in Florida! It is approximately 1 year old and quite dark. There’s a medicinal dark pit fruit nose overripe plum with some lighter red plum notes a soft sweetness around the edges and a hint of small barrel oak. Wow. Surprisingly smooth up-front rye flavors cushioned with a pleasantly odd sweetness with notes of cocoa and a soft rye finish. Intriguing."
2024,0,"Distilled from hickory-smoked malted barley. The nose leads with dark barbecue smoke mulberry orange peel cedar chest and winter campfire. Earl Grey tea tobacco leaf orange oil and black pepper dominate the palate along with a great deal of thick heavy smoke. A lot of new wood character and slightly rough around the edges but compelling. The sort of whiskey you’d find in a crumbling tower deep in the woods."
2025,0,"A Wisconsin rye aged in used American oak and new French oak then finished in a Limousin oak solera. Heavily perfumed; incense and sandalwood on top of leather gentle wood and pleasingly soft rye spice. Golden raisins white flowers and violets on the palate with a sweet and balanced finish. Softer and less assertive than traditional rye whiskeys but that’s not necessarily a bad thing."
2026,12,"Laden with herbs and spices—mint caraway earthy ginger—on the nose along with furniture polish and lemon. The palate is oak-driven and rich full of dark chocolate zippy caraway roasted lemon and ginger. There’s a pleasant fruitiness as well but the finish is dry all gentle spice and chocolate. Takes water well—in fact a few drops helps to tame some of the punchy heat. A blend of bourbon rye and malt whiskeys."
2027,2,"A bowl of sweet fresh cherries greets you on the nose the result of the Napa cabernet cask-finishing and it melds well with notes of lemon zest chocolate and a hint of smoky charcoal. The palate delivers more cherry as well as strawberries which combine with marshmallow and whipped cream and the finish has plenty of length. It’s a bouquet of chocolate and berries with impressive subtlety and complexity."
2028,11,"Not burning my nose; mild bread and vanilla aromas. Peppy stuff but not explosive on the palate; easily held five seconds on the tongue but fiery once it gets aerated. Sweet grain with a big saw-toothed edge of cinnamon and hot vanilla and a circling brim of zingy mint that tightens toward the finish. Pretty interesting stuff for wheat whiskey; a more expressive nose would seal the deal. Price is per 375ml."
2029,0,"Seattle bourbon made using Northwest grains. Aromas of goldenrod golden raisins and spicy stewed prunes; a panoply of alluring spices chocolate and oak. The palate carries through with similar notes along with apricot and dark red fruits but a dusty edge and an excess of tight tannic green oak hold it back. Chili-chocolate spice minerality and lingering fruit on the finish. Impressive complexity but somewhat woody and off-balance."
2030,11,"After 6 years aging in charred new oak and 8 years in “non-oak vessels” (stainless tanks) there’s a nose of oak cedar tart red plums gooseberries and fresh putty but none of the heat you’d expect. Explosive in the mouth: sweet fruit and dry oak slam-dance and set off a surprising burst of hops (wash was craft-brewed pilsner). Exciting stuff but a bit hot even with water. (2713 bottles released)"
2031,8,"Once you get over any initial disappointment (there is no peat smoke) this is one engaging and mouthwatering whiskey; clean with malty cereal notes golden raisins bread dough and freshly-sawn oak. The real clincher however is the captivating wisp of saline sea breeze echoing across a warming finish of cherry hard candies rye spice and salt brine. Medium-bodied fresh and delicious. (Distillery only) 375ml"
2032,8,"Crafted from estate-farmed organic grain and aged for 2 years. The flavors are impressively seamless with nice complexity and everything neatly in its place. Fresh oak is well integrated with notes of orange rind rosewater sweet corn and red fruits. The slick buttery palate sizzles with peppery spice—cinnamon hearts candies and ginger. Robust in flavor while showing impressive craftsmanship and polish. 375ml"
2033,8,"Lavish red fruit and sherry blanket this whiskey initially aged in American oak barrels followed by 12-18 months in oloroso sherry casks to approach 5 years age in total. It may be the light toast of the initial barrels that allows this wheat whiskey to stand up exceptionally well developing seamless flavors of figgy pudding walnuts chocolate-covered raisins cacao nibs and maple candy culminating in a finish that nicely balances fruit and leathery oak. Carries its proof nicely."
2034,8,"This whiskey portrays its coastal origin with a lovely sea-air quality that vies for attention with brown sugar beeswax and delicate smoke notes. Gentle peatiness weaves through the cocoa-tinged honeyed malt on the palate culminating in a smoldering finish where the mouthwatering saltiness seals the deal. Nicely integrated and well balanced with fine pot still character. A single malt of pale and peated malts aged 7 years in bourbon barrels."
2035,7,"Single barrel releases aren’t uncommon at craft bars but a whiskey distilled by the bar’s proprietor is rare. Dark amber color suggests high barrel impact but the wood is actually well balanced by caramel milk chocolate and honey-nut cereal. The opening is much softer lusher than you’d expect at this proof and balances in the mid-palate with oak salt cinnamon and a little heat. A dry finish rounds out a unique and flavorful whiskey. (less than 50 bottles; Grandten Distilling’s South Boston store only)"
2036,7,"Made from malted Bavarian hard wheat and aged over 2 years in new and used American oak barrels the nose is chocolate-covered pretzels and a dash of pepper spice with a slight edge. The entry is much softer than expected at this proof driven by toasted wheat and dark chocolate with vanilla and black pepper. A strong pepper kick at the end of the mid-palate drives a long spicy finish. A surprisingly well-balanced and actualized young craft whiskey."
2037,11,"A 70/20/10% mashbill (corn/wheat/malt) aged 32 months. A sweet corn citrus-tipped nose not as hot as expected. Hot on the tongue though and spreads like fire. Dynamic balance of sweet corn and spicy candy with crimping oak spice and alcohol heat. Finish is like fireworks: a rush to an explosion of sweet oaky heat in the back of the mouth with a slow spark rain that sparkles on the tongue. Exciting."
2038,11,"Spicy buttery nose (“aged six months with oak staves”) with some oak plank notes. Hey that's pretty tasty! Rye character is spicy forward and flows surely right into the nicely warm finish. Michigan-grown rye done in a pot still in downtown Detroit about a mile and a half from the Hiram Walker plant. Good young rye; one to watch."
2039,11,"Certified organic “aged under four years.” Oak is forward on the nose—young and fresh-sawn—with sweet spicy hard candies: cinnamon and teaberry. Juicy in the mouth: sweet springing with that spice-fruit bounce off an oak board. Rye oil hides in the back then slides forward with the oak to take over the finish. Dynamic. I haven't been a big Koval fan but we're definitely on the right path here."
2040,7,"An unabashedly spicy rye nose backed by cinnamon marzipan Bartlett pear and oak. The rye spice is right there on the palate and immediately joined by cinnamon clove black pepper solid oak and a lingering pear note on the fringe. The finish is long dry and spicy with a hint of black licorice candy. Pritchard’s rye is a perfect example of how you can have strong spice without a lot of fire and create balance without adding a lot of sweetness."
2041,11,"Mild and mellow nose of corn and oak with a bit of warehouse reek and a light cleanly earthy note. Smooth and sweet in the mouth with sweet cornmeal and sunny meadowgrass a touch of candied cinnamon. A very friendly and easy-going bourbon not too young not too old. Sourced whiskey."
2042,8,"Initially restrained; as the nose opens up it reveals plum red berry fruit pine resin and root-beer spices. The palate picks up a bit slightly vinous in its red-fruit drive herbal-cherry cough drop and sweet vanilla leading to a modest finish laced with licorice cinnamon and pine forest."
2043,7,"A rare barrel strength 100% rye release from a craft distiller. (Dark Horse Lenexa Kan.) No age statement on this other than “less than four years.” Young wood leads things off with pencil graphite and sawdust. Once you get past the sharp wood there’s lush maple brown sugar cinnamon and rye spice. At 113 proof it’s still soft supple and lush but slightly tannic. The finish is spicy but not overly hot or dry. Great distilling hampered by small barrels but still something special."
2044,8,"This amber-hued whiskey seems part bourbon part single malt offering a nose of sweet dried fruits —raisin and apples—heaped with earthy leathery oak. The palate is enjoyable for its crème caramel sweetness and drinkability but the drying oak is a bit heavy-handed overwhelming the medium body. A serviceable and versatile whiskey for the price. Corn malted barley wheat and rye."
2045,11,"High West has a second version of Valley Tan. The “Utah oat whiskey” was distilled to 87.5% (about the same proof as single pot still Irish and technically a “light whiskey”) aged 2 to 4 years in new and used cooperage. A light golden color; nose is somewhat spicy with a licorice/peppermint tinge and some alcohol heat. It's quite smooth almost Irish in its drinkability with grainy notes graced with that light peppermint and biscuit sweetness. Pleasant sipper indeed."
2046,11,"Bear Republic’s Racer 5 IPA has long been a beloved California craft beer. Charbay distiller Marko Karakasevic liked it so much he made whiskey from it. The Clear (aged 22 months in stainless tanks) sings with hoppy citrus zest and pine notes set in a sweet background. It’s nicely nuanced in the mouth though with a creamy body that sparkles with bitter orange and grapefruit floating over understated malt. Preferred over his Doubled & Twisted; this is more sophisticated."
2047,11,"A hot and spicy nose: dry rye sweet mint and alcohol heat. Hot on the tongue too with the mint flashing across an oily graininess. The finish is where it finally cools down laying down thin layers of sweet mint and light chocolate on the palate. Water tames the heat and brings out more chocolate but steals that nice finish. Not overly approachable but…it’s rye."
2048,11,"That’s “.36” as in ’36 caliber’ the first of this Texas distiller’s Small Caliber Series of Texas bourbon whiskeys. Sharpish on the nose with some hot alcohol cinnamon and oak warmed by burnt sugar and vanilla. A kick of hot oak spice on the tongue a flush of hot dry corn and flashes of mint and vanilla then a long spicy finish with more dry mint. One of the better young bourbons — only 8 months — I’ve had. Price is per 375 ml."
2049,11,"While it’s not technically a grain buckwheat makes great pancakes so buckwheat whiskey? Otay! This has an earthy aroma of hickory nuts and autumn leaves with some cinnamon peeking through; reminds me of Corsair’s quinoa whiskey. There’s a cushioned creamy mouthfeel more raw nuts a keen of oak a sweet lift through the mouth and at the end the leaves and more oak. Unique intriguing compelling; I keep going back for one more taste. Price is per 375 ml."
2050,11,"Same mashbill as the Laws Four Grain aged 4 years. Hard dry corn aromas; no sulfur. Hot straightforward corn and oak with active spices. One of the leanest most austere young bourbons I’ve ever tasted; no compromises no lush sweetness: savory bourbon. The finish is great: tingling and tasty for a long time after the swallow. Not a bonded for cocktails; sip this."
2051,11,"Mashbill of 95% rye 5% malt; both Colorado-sourced. Aged 3 years in full-size barrels. Same grass and spice in the nose as the Straight Rye but a sweet almost sherry-like note as well. Flavors are similar—rye grain bitter oil alcohol heat—but there’s an added hit of dry cocoa more heat and a better non-sticky finish with a grudging hint of sweetness at the end. Dialed up overall."
2052,11,"Catoctin Creek’s first malt whiskey made from wash brewed by Heritage Brewing of Manassas Va. aged in used Catoctin Creek whiskey barrels. Light floral notes fresh-cut pencil lead oak sawdust on the nose. Sweet and floral but with a firm backbone of oak and dry malt leading to a finish of candied oak: juicy-sweet but hard-cored. The profile is definitely Catoctin Creek whiskey which is great to see in a young distillery trying something new. Well done. (344 bottles distillery only)"
2053,11,"Scottish Highland malt whisky (from an undisclosed source; no age given) finished in Virginia in Virginia port barrels. Rich port fumes hit the nose malt’s in the background. Well-behaved in the mouth not overly hot or obviously youthful and the malt’s oily and luscious with a nice port wrapper. Finish is cleanly integrated without any heavy wood. Nice whiskey interesting idea. Sourced whiskey."
2054,8,"Baking spices pipe tobacco vanilla citrus peel cardamom dried apricots and dates unwind on the nose carried by plenty of fresh oak. The potent palate explodes with up-front sweetness laced with cocoa and maduro tobacco notes but the chest-thumping herbal oak brings it to a quick and slightly bitter finish. A splash of water brings the elements into better balance as peach syrup sweetness starts to shine."
2055,8,"The appealing nose features pretty biscuit notes great purity of malt and golden honeyed sweetness before adding some flavors of citrus blossom clover and cardamom with hints of licorice. On the palate the initial sweet malt quickly turns herbal with marjoram and a distinct sage note that lingers through a long finish of salt-tinged sweetness. Aged 2 years 6 months in full-size charred oak."
2056,8,"This is a bold style of bourbon finished in American brandy barrels and brandishing fiery spirit and sweet corn. Yet the beautiful sweetness layered with butter and spearmint underscored by cedary oak offers a lot to like especially on the nutty-sweet finish with its peanut and charred wood flavors."
2057,11,"A blend: 89% 2 year 6 month old MGP bourbon 11% 3 year old McKenzie rye. Other batches are different whiskeys. Sweet nose: some cinnamon and allspice dried hay and “clear toy” candies. Hot on the tongue with the spicy peppery intensity of youth (and rye) and roars right on through to the end where oak appears to add gravity to the finish. This would rock in a cocktail."
2058,11,"Razor-sharp aromas of clove seasoned wood and dried grass push firmly out of the glass. Hard-edged grain and spice continue on the palate but without the harshness you might expect from young whiskey with such a bold nose. It softens toward the finish and becomes sweeter with a hint of buttery fudge then develops an oaky dryness at the end. Impressive young whiskey."
2059,12,"There’s no missing the peat here; the nose is rife with ash rubber tires wood-burning fireplace and cedar bark. But it also reveals lovely aromas of roasted apples charred corn black pepper and roasted walnuts. Sweet corn apples honey and nuts step forward on the palate which is a bit hot along with black pepper cinnamon dark chocolate and oak. The finish is enjoyable ashiness—the end of a cigar."
2060,8,"Oak-driven and tightly wound with herbal licorice beeswax and dried peaches. There is a real outdoorsy quality here of forest floor autumn leaves and cut grass. But it feels somewhat tired and weary on the palate then falls apart with the addition of water. Grab the older bottling (50% ABV). This release has dropped in both proof and quality."
2061,12,"It’s all about the grain on the nose: corncob cooked mash along with hay and grass brown sugar and earthy dried herbs. Chewy tannins overtake more subtle fruit and spice notes in the mouth; add a little water to reveal grape jelly milk chocolate and cinnamon candy. An impressive start from this young Kentucky distillery though the short finish shows it has some developing yet to do. (236 bottles)"
2062,8,"Craft skeptics will find this very aligned to mainstream bourbon with its enticing nose of Peanut Chews candy gooey caramel and cocoa powder. The palate pours on sweet cornbread and marzipan just a touch hot and slightly antiseptic before the long finish of cherry and sweet vanilla. Lots of good stuff going on here."
2063,12,"Though it takes some easing into this whiskey shows pretty clove and vanilla notes on the nose along with some Elmer’s glue and grape Kool-Aid. The palate is where the rye grain starts to shine with spice peaches plums and milk and white chocolate and cooked cherries on the finish. Water is a must to cut through the youthful heat."
2064,12,"This is one for the oak fanatics. Wood and grain assert themselves right from the start but the nose retains balance with aromas of butterscotch fresh ginger and herbs. The oak-forward palate shows pleasant flavors of cherry cough drop dark chocolate blackberries red licorice star anise and ginger. Oak continues on the finish which has nice length. Don’t be shy about adding water."
2065,11,"Here’s something interesting: all-malt but not all barley malt there’s some rye and wheat malt as well. The rye pokes through as fresh grassy notes struggling with the young barrel character. Detonates on the palate: spice fudge vanilla grain and oak. This is brash loud stuff broad-shouldered insistent and cocky. Could find favor with the hophead clan of craft beer drinkers. You’d think it could use some taming but given a chance its boldness is appealing."
2066,8,"Fresh oak sweet malt caramel and spiced cherries flirt with cracked pepper on the nose while the smooth and sweet palate offers up clean flavors of citrus zest butterscotch drying oak and saddle leather. Pleasantly herbal and licoricey on the palate with a perky cinnamon-spice finish. Nicely executed. 70% rye with certified organic grain. 375ml"
2067,8,"An intense nose offers complexity with minty herbal notes licorice fresh-sawn oak and peppery spice at the forefront giving way to pithy orange peel on the palate. With a bit of water to subdue the punch this becomes impressively smooth and fruity revealing sandalwood aromas and offering a lovely long finish of candied orange and sweet chocolate-covered cherries. 60% corn 20% wheat 10% rye 10% barley."
2068,8,"An intriguing whiskey this smells like a flat warm beer that was so good you still want to drink it the next day. Triple distilled from Samuel Adams Boston Lager the hop notes are quite identifiable and really work well imparting citrus pine and floral aromas. The palate is medium-bodied with marshmallow sweetness stone fruits guava and passion fruit sprinkled with sea salt. Unusual yet delicate lively and almost refreshing."
2069,11,"Made from an Irish whiskey recipe from 1865 (“dug up” by David Wondrich) with malt raw barley rye malt and rolled oats distilled in an alembic pot still. Amber with a distinct red/pink cast to it. Very fruity nose—greengage plum mulberry sweet orange—with creamy vanilla. Tastes of sweet cereal with a firm bitter keel; the fruit returns as an echo in the finish. A very craft beer-like whiskey; challenging interesting unexpected. A bit brash but worth investigating."
2070,11,"The first bourbon made in Pennsylvania in over 25 years using locally-grown organic Wapsie Valley dent corn which comes in yellow and maroon; a 1 year old bottling. The aroma is distinctive: deep mint clove and red plum. Warming and sweet then broadening on the palate the corn becomes prominent. Finish is hot but tasty. This is a young one with promise."
2071,11,"Aged 2 years 1 month in 53-gallon charred oak barrels it's straight. So's the nose: green herbal and oily with rye and backed by oak. Mouth is honest: youthfully zesty rye flavors grassy freshness oak and alcohol warmth and a savory rye finish. Nothing gets in the way of a pure experience. Good young rye."
2072,11,"Good bourbon nose—oak corn allspice a little sweet citrus—but some solvent notes flitting around too. Feisty in the mouth; warming punchy oak softer pillow-thumps of corn and some bitter rye notes. More rye comes out as it sits. Finish is long and warm. Good young bourbon; priced like a good older bourbon. Craft still presents some hard choices."
2073,11,"There’s that 95% rye mashbill that tags this as an LDI-sourced rye…but it’s been finished in French oak white wine barrels. Pepper warm ripe red plum sweet vanilla and a slice of nougat make for a sweet and urgent nose. The rye blows up in the mouth lots more peppery spice some flashy mint and a thin honeyed sweetness that hints at the nougat. Finish is a bit clingy but a nice young rye with an interesting difference. (sourced whiskey)"
2074,8,"This whiskey shows some green-spirit youth but it’s headed in a good direction with sassafras toasted nuts leather forest aromas and a touch of furniture polish. It’s much bigger on the palate as burnt peanut candies meet baking spices and treacle. The wood jumps out a bit and the fiery youth is undeniable but plenty to like. (2580 bottles)"
2075,8,"The nose offers a nice mélange of herbal and fruit notes as pine sap earthy forest floor and menthol balance with sweet Bananas Foster and baked apple. More banana on the palate plus juicy stone fruits sprinkled with cinnamon before a drying finish that nicely weaves cocoa spices oak and saddle leather."
2076,7,"Big Bottom has made their name finishing sourced whiskeys. Now they’re experimenting with a blend of undisclosed whiskeys in a bourbon base. The result is a riff on Canadian-style whisky. Dark gold in color the nose is light oak caramel cinnamon and cherry. On the palate it’s a pleasant mix of creamy vanilla oak and cinnamon. A medium finish features light charred oak and black pepper spice. A unique approach to the style one that manages to really work."
2077,8,"Makes a pleasant first impression as sweet apple and corn notes meet summer flowers Cracker Jack and fresh oak. The palate shows a pleasingly oily texture as butterscotch candy and roasted peanuts come with hints of spice and orange peel. The nutty finish shows toasted almonds and caramel."
2078,11,"Big mint/grass nose with sweet grain and a touch of vanilla behind it. Fiery slippery with rye oiliness popping with that mint and rye-bitter on the finish; a bit of a bully. That's not all bad though; too many ryes strive to be smooth these days but this lets it rock and does it well. A chunk of ice doesn't hurt this at all. Potent bold. Sourced whiskey."
2079,8,"Aromas of menthol licorice and herbs have a slightly antiseptic quality yet the caramelized oak and grilled pineapple flavors keep it grounded in bourbon. Bold and intriguing on the palate it pours a bit hot with lots of cedar shingle and sandalwood balanced by banana and toasted marshmallow. Cinnamon and candied orange on the finish. A blend of Indiana bourbons and Tennessee whiskeys finished in red wine casks."
2080,11,"Wyoming Whiskey (Kirby Wyo.) is making bourbon from Wyoming grain on a column still aged in full-sized barrels...in the Wyoming climate. Minty grassy meadow-varied plants; a bit of cedar and old clothes. Mouth is fuller with more corn sweetness and balance than the small batch (see below). Notes of sweet citrus rye punchiness and that cedar flit by quickly in the mouth and the finish is long and smooth. Much preferred over the small batch."
2081,2,"Soft oak brown sugar and a back note of iron start things off followed by hints of corn muffin red candy and a subtle note of dried red fruit. The palate leads with vanilla rice pudding a light note of orange peel milk chocolate and green apple. It’s creamy light and sweet with baking spice enlivening the chocolate. The finish is lengthy ending with vanilla icing and a buttery note."
2082,11,"Sourced whiskey selected then finished by Big Bottom in Zin casks at their Oregon warehouse. Ruby glint to the whiskey and a big sweet hot nose with a wine-side fruity slant to it. Wine’s more apparent
on the palate; there’s a bit of oak bite and red wine tang heating up the bourbon which is broad without obvious corn. The corn appears in the finish which is firm and gripping. The Zinfandel finish is well-played here."
2083,11,"More pale than other crafts I usually see; the whiskey is 12 to 21 months old and spends time serially in wine casks medium toast American oak barrels and finally “very experienced” French oak. Smell is
quite young but clean with notes of orange and rye grain and a whiff of nutty toffee. Quite a lively mouth with much more toffee less orange a hint of odd spice (cardamom?) and a twist of milk chocolate at the finish. Interesting stuff."
2084,8,"An enjoyable 2 year old from Colorado the sweet stone fruit nose laced with mint and herb garden betrays this spirit as a bit young and primary. Still a touch hot and lacking some intensity but pleasing clover honey sweetness on the palate and long warming spice with a cocoa finish bode very well for the future."
2085,11,"Wigle’s also doing a series of finishing experiments with the addition of honeycombed wood chunks to their organic wheat whiskey; this one uses white ash. Sweeter nose than the straight-up wheat whiskey (see below); mouth is cleaner and the astringency I noted on the end is ameliorated. All a matter of degrees though; quite similar to the regular wheat whiskey. Price is per 375 ml."
2086,8,"Very aromatic and pretty with floral lilac violet and rosewater notes that follow through on the palate like a grandmother’s kiss. The perfumed soap and sachet qualities are underscored by oaky contributions of vanilla and crème brûlée. Perhaps not for everyone but this shows another thoroughly enjoyable side of rye whiskey."
2087,8,"Bright and lively with violets plenty of fresh oak and traces of mint and pine leading to a palate of butterscotch bright citrus warming spice and sweet vanilla with drying and dusty cocoa. There is a glimmer of youth expected given that 20% of this blend is their own distillery-made rye aged less than 2 years. It’s an exciting glimpse of what’s to come but the younger rye does little to enhance the great stuff they’ve been sourcing."
2088,11,"Another MGP/LDI-sourced whiskey: but New Holland finishes it in oak barrels that they’ve used to age their Dragon’s Milk imperial stout an interesting reversal of the bourbon barrel-aged beers brewers are making. It gives a dark wood nose with cinnamon and hot fruit. The whiskey’s a bit light in the mouth but enticingly smooth a flow of corn wood and anise that flares up at the finish in a nice rush of heat. Quite good…but not great."
2089,11,"Oddly smoky nose that grows on you — this is blue corn smoked with Texas scrub oak — you can smell burnt oak and light wreathings of corn. The first jolt is jalapeño without the heat followed by a cornbread rush with a very light riff of smoke. The smoke builds to the finish and curls nicely around the corn. A very different whiskey experience; one I could get to like (could I try some with a plate of brisket?)."
2090,11,"Well-named: hops aroma comes flying right out of the glass — green pine and light peppermint — along with hot sweet booze but it’s a very clean scent not feinty or heavy. The whiskey itself is quite light not overbearing and sweet with more pine and mint along with a very pure malt character and a light touch of oaky vanilla. This is IPA booze a rain-pure version and more barrel could ruin it. Great gateway whiskey for a beer geek."
2091,11,"A new Small Caliber Series bottling distilled from 100% rye. Nose gives rye dough mint candies and a push of rye oil and crushed grass. Punchy and perky on the tongue hot and spicy young rye character with black pepper and bitter rye slicing through a sweet body; quite dynamic. Ranger Creek makes exciting whiskeys for sure and this one shows an increasing talent for balance. Price is per 375 ml."
2092,11,"Same specs as the Secale Rye Single Barrel. Grassy nose spicy hard candy hot mint and split-rock dryness. Dry rye grain a tweak of bitterness and alcohol heat. Finish is a bit oily/sticky. Good example of the modern MGP-inspired rye interpretation: grain-forward and no-nonsense."
2093,11,"Is it whiskey? Sorghum’s a grain but sorghum syrup is pressed from the stalk of the plant. But HighWire Distilling uses Muddy Pond sorghum syrup which mashes the grain in with the stalk. So…we’ll say yes whiskey. Spritely on the tongue: lively and quick sweet but spicy with oak and not an off note. Crying for a cube and a shot of seltzer. Whiskey? Probably. Good? Yes!"
2094,8,"Super floral with bright lemon and yuzu this beams with originality as violet candies rose petal and pine forest join the fray. The mouthfeel has a satisfying oily texture and a slightly tart bright citrus lift before the creamy sweetness settles in nicely balanced with drying oak tannins."
2095,8,"Driven by earthy oak and dark cocoa on the nose this whiskey is alluring in its rustic richness with saddle leather and a pocketful of dried fruit pulled from an old backpack. On the palate the cherry and red berry fruit meet some pleasant peppery and clove spice with the impression of lemon oil. Pleasingly drinkable with caramel and more oak on the modest finish."
2096,7,"Traditionally this release has been a showcase for the raw power and spice of both young and old rye. In this single barrel release the spice and fire have been considerably tamed by deep caramel vanilla and sweet corn. The spice is still there with oak rye and cinnamon but is no longer the star. The proof shows up in the finish which is long and quite dry. An understated expression of one of High West’s flagship releases. Sourced whiskey. (Drink Up New York only)"
2097,11,"A wheater 70/20/10 corn/wheat/malt barrel proof and 32 months old. A rich corn nose with some wood notes and a slightly antiseptic sting of alcohol heat. Young in the mouth—cinnamon candy a bit meaty—but all the right pieces are in place: warmth corn oak spice and a smooth progression to the warm finish. Good already and showing even more promise."
2098,11,"Wheats have a fruitier nose than bourbons it seems and this is no exception. Gentle almost delicate fruits on the nose: white grapes honeydew melon baked apple. So smooth on the palate: sweet pastry light baked apple a nice oak grip keeping it all together. Sip it straight or build a big highball with just a splash of soda on the ice. Such a friendly whiskey."
2099,11,"Organic Pennsylvania-grown rye 3 years old pot-distilled a 20-minute walk from the Monongahela River. Nose: sharp rye and hard oak floral wreathing but not hair-crispingly hot. Oh nice rye mouth flavorful not overly bitter the oak’s held in check and there’s a minty sweetness to it. Finish is well-tempered until a note of perfume sneaks in at the end."
2100,11,"Maryland Monongahela and I guess Modern are the American rye styles. Maryland was a gentler rye less spicy and not as hot/sweet as modern rye. This has the dry-grass spice of rye a hint of cocoa powder and a bit of funk that blows away to hints of fruit. Light and clean on the palate some sweetness that rapidly dries out in a grassy herbal wave. Intriguing without being overwhelming."
2101,11,"Warm delicate vapors curl from the glass: dry grain sweet orange peel honey candy but all of it ethereally light. Quick in the mouth makes other whiskeys seem heavy with wood. Sweet grain is the base of the structure with a skin of soft citrus candy and custard notes. Wood is mostly present as a lightweight frame almost like a zeppelin framework containing delicate volumes of flavor. This is craft charting a new course."
2102,12,"On the nose the peat presents itself as an autumn bonfire with dried logs and dried leaves mingling with gentle spices of white pepper dried ginger and a bit of salinity. The wood keeps burning through the palate which is fairly hot and replete with classic bourbon flavors of vanilla caramel roasted nuts and apples. Pleasant enough but ultimately a simple whiskey."
2103,2,"Whistle Pig raised the share of its own 2 year old rye from 20 percent to 32 percent in this second Farmstock release balancing it against 6 and 10 year old sourced ryes like in the 001 release. Fresh oak mixes with vanilla orange peel and pepper on the nose leading to a palate of vanilla and butterscotch. Citrus emerges with water. Pepper notes return on the finish along with chocolate and caramel. There’s youthfulness here but also potential."
2104,11,"A “mesquite smoked Texas single malt whiskey” this is a distillation of Ranger Creek’s Mesquite Smoked Porter. If you’re expecting to get shot out of the saddle surprise: the aroma is quite delicate with light mesquite malt melon and butterscotch. The mesquite strikes first in the mouth—ashy drying a bit medicinal—followed by the cooler sweeter malt and melon and a hint of the chocolate malts in the porter. Another good young (6 months) whiskey from Ranger Creek. Price is per 375ml."
2105,11,"Sweet corn and dried cherries on the nose; pleasantly quirkily intense. The palate is clean sweet with corn and a hint of those cherries framed by oak and leads to a finish with no surprises: corn oak and a slight clench of heat. It’s almost predictable: there are no real flaws but there’s no greatness either. Still solid delivery is a good thing. (sourced whiskey) —LB"
2106,0,"Bourbon made with Arkansas corn soft red winter wheat and malted barley. White flowers citrus fresh dill and wet cardboard on the nose. The palate is woody and somewhat harsh with some chocolate raspberry and ground pepper flavors. Quite dry with tannic oak and sticky pine. Bitter oak on the finish. Primarily wood-driven; the oak overpowers the other flavors."
2107,11,"A young (“minimum of 6 months”) rye finished in California vermouth barrels. The results are polarizing; I’m in the “intriguingly tasty” camp. The nose: rye spice with herbal depth and fruit wreathing. The whiskey hits first but herbal vermouth is right behind putting more body on the spirit and cranking the finish in an unexpectedly dry almost bitter direction. An aperitif whiskey begging to play with cocktails or even ice but good neat. Craft whiskey continues to experiment."
2108,11,"Another American single malt from Colorado. A meaty savory aroma with molasses cookie and herbal cough drop underneath. Roughly sweet in the mouth with hints of smoke and bitter chocolate sweet orange and stewed apples with a strong back note of anise. For all the strange name and really strange logo (antlers on a barrel?) this is not bad at all."
2109,11,"Local Montana grains in an impressively brown all-Montana bourbon. Has a small-barrel smell to it—a dry wood and hard candy note I’m starting to recognize—and a snap of rye. Interesting: light but not weak in the mouth. I found their moonshine not that clean but the wood’s done a good job on it. Rye grass and sweet corn mingle with pepper and anise. Clean finish. (Montana only)"
2110,8,"Soft and sweet; ripe apricot honeyed porridge and sweet vanilla take the lead with a palate that elicits warm peach cobbler sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon. There is lots of freshly-sawn oak apparent throughout but ample fruit keeps this whiskey juicy right through a pleasantly spicy finish. Fruit forward smooth and lovely; a real eye-opener for a whiskey of 100% soft white winter wheat. 375ml"
2111,8,"Cereal grains flour-dusted breadboard fresh cut hay horehound lozenge and apple pie. The appearance of Fig Newtons cookie and toasted rye bread flavors nicely complements green peppercorn spice and an herb garden edge with good length to the salted-caramel and sweet maple finish. Pot distilled from 100% Michigan rye and aged in full-sized barrels. It’s just a touch green but drinking nicely and totally on track. More patience will pay dividends."
2112,8,"A nice jolt of violets pepper and sawn oak on the nose is underscored by some green stick and leafy sassafras notes turning a bit more dark and chewy on the palate with caramel figgy fruit green peppercorns and a long and bold finish dominated by dark chocolate. Softens up nicely with water and reveals more fruitiness."
2113,11,"One of a series of Berkshire bottlings done in barrels used to age craft beers; this one aged the massive (29%!) and complex Samuel Adams Utopias. The beer barrel adds a depth to Berkshire’s usually brighter character a rounded and full sweetness with rum and fruit notes. There’s heat and youthful sweetness and a pleasing fullness that grows toward the warming finish. A nice twist on the usual bottling. (Massachusetts only)"
2114,7,"You wouldn’t believe from the nose on this white whiskey that it’s nearly 50% alcohol. Sweet fresh-milled cornmeal combines with slightly acidic and floral pear with just a dash of yeast to form an inviting and approachable nose. On the palate it’s equally affable and well-balanced with sweet corn crisp pear and white pepper spice. A nice long finish with a touch of cooling rounds off an expertly-crafted and enjoyable moonshine."
2115,11,"Oat malt rye and wheat are the four organic grains (like you I was instantly curious); nice amber color. Hot and sweet (with a hint of dill) on the nose rafting in on a thick oak plank. Sweet grain cut wood and lingering heat make this good but I'm looking for more complexity. There's no clear handle to this one no “I'm bourbon” or “I'm malt” which is intriguing but it's just...good not inspiring. Odd complaint but there you are."
2116,11,"100% pilsner malt fermented with Belgian ale yeast. Not unaged whiskey; a grain spirit meant to be drunk without aging. Sweet-tart intense aroma of unripe cherries plums white pepper and a bit of caramel. Smooth on the tongue with a roll of heat grain comes forward and dominates the fruit though it balances at the finish. Clean even interesting. More poitin should be like this. (Pennsylvania and New Jersey only)"
2117,11,"Made from 100% organic red winter wheat aged 2 years 1 month. Much lighter on the nose than its rye stablemate (see above); notes of butterscotch and green tea with a bit of oaky strength. Flavors of cracked grain and light stone fruits shimmer across the tongue; the oak stays high in the mouth. Finish is light and long moving from grain to wood at the end. Interesting and delicate for a 2 year old."
2118,11,"Nose is mild pleasant sweet with rock candy cinnamon and baked apple. Follow-through on the palate is almost exact: mild pleasant sweet with rock candy etc. plus a nice bit of extra alcohol heat and quiet oak shaping the finish. A mild-mannered bourbon which I feel is like a mild-mannered rodeo bull; out of place. There's nothing wrong but it's a bit too easy-drinking too mild. Bulk up."
2119,8,"Seems to show good maturity on the nose with nutty herbal woody and husky grain aromas. The notes of warm porridge with brown sugar portend the sweet palate almost cloying with ripe red fruits. Warm chocolaty and spicy but the somewhat hot finish and dusty oak floorboard quality don’t leave the best lasting impression."
2120,11,"Now that’s something you don’t see every day. Kings County (Brooklyn N.Y.) used peat-smoked malt in this bourbon. The nose is bonfire and sweet juicy corn; the undiscovered Hebridean Isle of Kentucky? The smoke is less forward on the tongue; you don’t get so much a peaty bourbon as you get an unusually rich broad young bourbon. More warming corn digestive biscuits and a pleasantly hot finish. Compelling and…what kind of Manhattan would this make? (400 bottles; at the distillery only) Price is per 375 ml."
2121,2,"A nose of white pepper and spice as well as salty brine light sea smoke and toasted wood followed by white chocolate confectionery sweetness and wild berries. Rich and full on a front palate that’s somewhat youthful led by notes of vanilla milk chocolate marzipan and treacle with lemon and almond adding some zest. The finish lingers with a hint of salinity and toasted wood as well as light smoke."
2122,12,"Light and delicate characteristics abound. The nose has raspberries and orange peel along with fresh-cut wood iced tea and rose petals. Wood dominates the palate lifted by gentle spice rock candy walnut shell stewed plums and grain. The finish is short with cola wood and bread."
2123,11,"Sourced whiskey moved to used bourbon barrels then finished in barrels that held their Pine Barrens whiskey (also reviewed this issue). Pine sap sweet juicy berries and oak aromas; had to re-nose to be sure on that pine. Mouth is relatively smooth much more so than the Rough Rider bourbon. Picking up some of that Pine Barren fudge and a touch of rye grassiness. Finish is warm and spicy. A nice young rye."
2124,11,"There's big oak caramel cinnamon and clove spice and fresh grain in the nose; not a shy soft wheat whiskey at all. Good body supporting spiciness mint and young oak; the small barrel punches tempered by sweet grain and spice. Finish gets a bit dusty and astringent crimping things. Wood-balanced not dominated by it. Bold dynamic."
2125,11,"Distilled from a 10% 70 IBU barleywine from Blue Point Brewing on Long Island. I’m smelling light pine hop notes dried spruce plank and heavy fudge; a muddled heavy nose. Much better in the mouth: the fudge is restrained the spruce and hops bring a lightness and verve to things. Not the “single malt” you might be expecting but very much American craft distilling; like nothing else intriguing bold a bit young and with a lot of promise. Price is per 375 ml."
2126,8,"Limited by its obvious youth on the nose but the fresh herb chiffonade character offers intrigue with distinct sage coupled with some chamomile notes. The palate is a step in the right direction with dark berries spices vanilla and charred marshmallows although somewhat light bodied and supple in texture. Young but sweet and honest."
2127,8,"There is a rich and robust distillate lurking under all that oak with chewy maple candies chocolate-covered cherries and rhum agricole intensity. The astringent oak does no favors for the heat of this 100-proof whiskey but with its lingering dark chocolate and char it’s still a bold and tasty rye."
2128,11,"Another MGP/LDI-sourced rye which KGB Spirits then ages additionally at their Alcalde New Mexico site; it’s tagged as a 15 year old whiskey. An oaky sweet nose with hot cereal notes. The tongue impact is breathtaking: a hot thick slam of spice mint and wood that cools to a long sweet mint finish. A bit of water tames it a bit and brings out more oaky notes and more sweetness. Powerful stuff."
2129,11,"A 2 year old bourbon made from Texas-grown white corn. It sports a dusty nose full of dry corn and oaky spice. The whiskey is big-boned juicy and sweet but with a bitter streak of wood running through it. The finish confirms the youth of the whiskey as it flames in a long hot wind-up. Some very interesting components here waiting for better integration."
2130,11,"Is buckwheat a grain seed or nut? Doesn’t matter: you can malt it so Corsair put it in their rye bourbon as a fourth…whatever. Aromas of corn vanilla and teaberry with a pleasant broadness and light herbal notes. There’s a nutty note to the sweet corn and vanilla and a move in the direction of astringency but it’s intriguing a definite plus. The layered finish has a woody nip to it that dry earthiness and sweet corn."
2131,11,"All four of these Catskill whiskeys are in exceptionally beautiful bottles. Pleasant homey smell of furniture polish dried mint and grass golden syrup and sweet dough wrapped in a thin layer of oak. Brightly sweet more mint and grass some cashew richness and an insistent singing thread of oak that broadens to the finish where the sweet and the oak balance with a new note of melon. A bit of astringency at the end but this is right decent whiskey. Price is per 375 ml."
2132,11,"Distilled from imperial stout and “vapor infused” with hops this is a bold example of Darek Bell’s “Alt Whiskeys.” Piney hops hot toffee and chocolate notes fill the nose. It’s a long ride on the palate: brisk spice first then hops and hot malt a mealy undercurrent that pulls you from a cocoa start to a hot and sweet finish with a burnt note on the very end. Busy but consistent."
2133,11,"From Finger Lakes distilling; one of two craft ryes I’m revisiting this issue. An interesting aroma of dry hay dried fruit and burlap that’s appealing to anyone who’s spent time on a farm. Smooth but not laid-back on the tongue there’s plenty of good stuff going on here. Peppery rye some soft fruit that fresh burlap and an urgent but not unwelcome heat. Maybe a little overdone on the fruit but well-done overall."
2134,11,"A mashbill of 60/20/10/10 corn/wheat/rye/malt aged 3 years in full-size barrels. Nose is sweet hot corn but with an initial puff of sulfur; where’s that from? Interesting splash in the mouth with smooth wheat character knocking back the rye spice. Fairly hot with some clove/cinnamon spice amping up as it winds down to the warm finish. Very active whiskey."
2135,11,"100% malt whiskey aged “to taste” in white oak vats (1000-2000 gallons!) on toasted cubes of hickory maple mulberry red oak and grape wood. Pleasantly fruity nose with a firm oak backboard. Malt is dominant on the tongue a bit shallow but the woods contribute a bubbling complexity. Unfortunately things don’t really come together in the finish but the experiment’s not a loss given the interesting effects of the multiple woods. Worth a taste."
2136,11,"Peat-smoked American malt whiskey. Nose isn’t so much peaty-smoky as it is sweet and husky; like cocoa bean mulch that’s been rained on a few times. The smoke’s there on the tongue though beautifully restrained light and sweet. For small-barrel whiskey this is surprisingly subtle and the dance of the smoke is enticing. The oak’s a bit sharp though and clamps on the finish; points off there. Promising."
2137,8,"There is lovely freshness here with sawn oak bread dough and baking spice aromas. Despite the generous 80% rye content the malt component really comes through offering good backbone creamy caramel sweetness and approachability. A streak of pleasingly peppery rye is balanced with sweet vanilla leading to a lively finish with mint and chocolate malt balls."
2138,11,"“Aged less than 4 years.” Sharp new oak (this is 30-gallon barrel aged) with hot cinnamon and sugar in the nose. Dry and a bit hot up front but its wheat comes through in a smoother sweeter middle and a gentle warm finish where corn finally appears. No real flaws here; it could be better integrated but it has a rough appeal."
2139,11,"Rye grain fresh-sawn wood and a hint of brittle sugar. No corn here: the mashbill is rye wheat and malt. Bitter rye edge drives this into the palate blowing open space for the smoother body to follow and briefly sweeten things up before the rye warp collapses in an oily spicy savory finish. Quite discreet and small-scale; this doesn't roar it urges. Good but it needs more breadth and wood depth to be great. (Massachusetts only.)"
2140,11,"A 1 year old whiskey made from rye wheat and cherrywood-smoked malt. An interesting sweet/sour nose with Montmorency cherry sweet grain bitter rye and a slap of fresh leather jacket. Follows through in the mouth but more integrated a sweet cocktail of neat whiskey with only the slightest hint of “smoke.” The leather slips in at the finish and wraps things up neatly. A bit overly sweet a bit simple but good."
2141,11,"100% rye unmalted and malted direct-fire pot stilled “old wood finished”: a detailed label but no age statement or “straight.” Peppery minty nose with a fleeting hint of coal smoke lots of heat. Fierce rye flavor hot and sweet and then a fantastic finish that curls and flexes: sweet oily hot pepper and small barrel oak. The rest of it’s okay but that finish is a marvelous ride."
2142,11,"Wigle’s proud to have a full 2 years of age on this organic wheat whiskey. It’s small-barrel dark but the nose isn’t a ripper: it’s 100 proof hot but sweet with grain and even light fruity notes (pear and ripe melon). There’s no denying it’s aggressive especially for a wheat whiskey but the small-barrel oak blends well with the grain giving a robust set of flavors: oak hard candies grilled fruit. A bit loud a bit pushy but endearing."
2143,11,"Another from a series of beer barrel-finished bourbons from this Massachusetts distiller; this one’s from a Terrapin Brewing’s Monk’s Revenge Belgian IPA barrel. Nose is fruity and sweet with an undertone of linen and old iron. There is the bitter and faintly piney edge of hops in the whiskey which adds a cutting grip to the finish. Before that there is spoonbread oak and a hint of anise. Interesting components needs a bit more integration."
2144,11,"Nose of sweet dried grass and cinnamon echoed on the palate with supports of sweet oaky vanilla. The finish develops some doughiness then finally an oaky spice heat that lingers pleasantly the most interesting part of the dram. Well-made (at Cedar Ridge in Iowa) and clean if not exceptionally complex. A good flask whiskey for a hike. Sourced whiskey."
2145,12,"Heat and peat dominate the nose—this is young and fiery with rubber bonfire cedar chest charred corn and apple aromas. The palate continues to burn though with a nice amount of grilled meat red fruit and flavored tobacco notes especially when water is added. Unfortunately the smoke is not so well-integrated and it shows on the finish which has a cloying sweet ashiness."
2146,11,"Triticale is a wheat/rye hybrid which I guess appealed to the wheat-mad Dry Fly distillers. Aromas of grass bubble gum and oak. Taste is young brashly sweet but smooth enough to spread easily over the tongue. There’s spice—light cinnamon a zip of allspice heat—and grassy brightness but they’re dressing on the juicy sweet center. Not flawed and well-made but I wish it had more to say. Price is per 375ml."
2147,11,"Crystal clear and colorless. Somewhat rich for unaged corn spirit: corn baked apple grass and a very light honeysuckle syrup. Quite mellow on the tongue; sweet but with a drying finish of baked grain sweet dried grass and finally just a hint of heat high in the mouth. A pleasant little glass."
2148,9,"A blend of bourbon rye and smoky Scotch whisky. The foundation here is bourbon sweetness (caramel toffee vanilla) with a tug-of-war between rye spice (cinnamon evergreen nutmeg) and peat smoke. Tobacco and honey-soaked berries round out the palate with additional leather notes on the finish. Not something I would drink every day but this whisky packs plenty of intrigue. (sourced whiskey)"
2149,11,"High West now has aged whiskey of their own make. This oat whiskey was aged “less than two years” in used cooperage and that’s just what it looks like about chardonnay color in the glass. The aroma is mellow and sweet with a hint of flowers and grapes. Clean and surprisingly mellow sweet grain flavors even a bit creamy but the 46% delivers a high bite. Very nice finish. (Limited annual release in December.)"
2150,11,"Rich full and clean cornbread nose with just a hint of herbal zip; not what I expected at all from a white whiskey with a jokey name and label. Light vaporous corn glides over the tongue with a hint of fresh grass easing off the palate to an airy corn finish; a lingering thought of corn. Corn eau de vie with an accomplished touch on the still; very impressive."
2151,8,"Herbal licorice and cinnamon notes are initially quite alluring but stifled by a slightly sour note peering through. Still this is identifiably bourbon with sweet corn drive leathery oak and cocoa coming together nicely before a warming finish of spice candies."
2152,8,"Mashbill of 47% corn followed by rye wheat and barley. Aromas of golden fruit with grassy freshness (hay and floral notes) turn a bit more plump and juicy on the palate with apricot raspberry and some tropical fruit—pineapple and mango—emerging. Orange-peel citrus character is lifted by white pepper spice before the oak-laden leathery drying finish."
2153,8,"The nose of this mahogany-hued ‘single-malt’ portends dense and chewy flavors of brown sugar dates and toasted walnuts. It’s a bit fiery on the palate where it unleashes a rush of dried fruits smoke and spice. While some raw spirit character peeks through this unconventional whiskey holds appeal for its originality with a stout-like crescendo of coffee and mocha on the very long finish."
2154,8,"Aged up to 5 years this whiskey serves up lots of fresh oaky sawdust with its caramel and toffee along with some varnish notes. Aromas of spice and smoke lead to a palate of butterscotch smooth and oily in texture with robust warming spice and a dry leathery and tannic finish. Nice maturity and polish for the price."
2155,11,"It seemed a good idea to revisit OMG after High West had four years’ experience under their belt. The wet grain and green apple are still there with the bitter fringe of rye crisping things nicely. Pure rye High West spirit no oak and you see where this may go. A smooth almost creamy entry—smooth for the proof—and the rye takes over though grainy sweetness refuses to quit. More polished now. Hope there’s plenty in wood."
2156,11,"Certified organic distilled from 100% rye. First whiff: like that smell when you tear apart anti-theft plastic packaging. Swirl and warm to get unseeded rye bread old books bitter grass. Palate is quite right: sweet grain and a bit of mint balanced by bitter rye oils and wood slipping into a sweet but wood-framed finish. Pleasantly youthful whiskey in the mouth; nose is sharp still."
2157,11,"A 2:1 blend of rye and “hand-malted barley” lightly smoked with fruitwood aged with apple and oak wood chips in used bourbon barrels finished in another used bourbon barrel aged 12 months total. Was it worth it? A good rye smell with fruit notes; quite appealing. Relatively smooth and the smoke comes through quickly with sweet pepper spice and vanilla. Not overly complex but well-made and pleasant."
2158,7,"The nose features strong rye spice accompanied by sharp young oak along with black pepper graphite and a touch of green apple. The entry is much heavier and sweeter than you’d expect from such a young whiskey. Things quickly change in the mid-palate with a spice blast of cinnamon black pepper rye and oak. A solid dash of heat gives the mid-palate some kick and drives a short dry finish. Some nice ideas hampered by the reality of youth."
2159,11,"Organic rye all grown on the Myer farm in the Finger Lakes by John Myer himself. 100% rye converted with enzymes; the Myers do everything in-house. Nose is bent with rye oiliness and a faint peppermint brightness. In the mouth it’s rye bitterness all the way through a crisp fresh-chewed mint in a mouthful of sweet grassiness and then a very quick finish: wham bam and gone. Simple and clean; could add depth and polish."
2160,11,"New distillery in Lancaster Penn. “Locally sourced” grain copper pot still unaged. Rich new-make smell warm full grain rye oil and anise. Light spirit: sweet more grain and a character like pizzelles; sweet crisp anise cookies. Easily enjoyed with a finish of more sweet grain and anise. Interestingly schnapps-like given the area’s German roots."
2161,8,"Pale gold in color. Generous oak imparts honeycomb white chocolate vanilla custard and some mint notes that hint of a delicate pretty bourbon. The palate is a bit deeper displaying chocolate berry fruit and Bit-O-Honey candy; quite confectionary with sweet marshmallow fluff. A pleasing and interesting whiskey worth trying but feels just a bit disjointed."
2162,11,"Fresh grains and sawn oak on the nose with some green grass and stalks. Spicy fresh flavors of corn and oak along with a doughy softness that contrasts with the 48% ABV heat. There’s a somewhat bosky note of leaves and duff a salty cracker component and a medicinal hint; the almost herbal complexity I’ve come to expect from Coppersea. Interesting tasty well off the beaten bourbon path."
2163,11,"“Spirits distilled from grain and sugar” on the label and the word “whiskey” is nowhere to be seen but we’ve stretched the definition before; and this stuff tasted okay unaged. Smells like oak candy wrapped in fresh leaves. A bit hot but like warm cereal on the tongue and the oak fills in the back. Sippable and likely to make a good Old-Fashioned as well."
2164,8,"Wheat has been swapped for oats in this release but the agenda remains the same a very primary whiskey with grain at the forefront and just a hint of oak roundness to the surprisingly creamy palate. Fresh flour violet candies hints of clove spice and persistent sweetness the palate gives the impression of warm breakfast cereal laced with banana and lemon a testament to the quality of the distillate."
2165,11,"Sweet corn and oak with some green apple and grass notes; a light pleasant nose that goes hot closer to the surface. Quite light and young in the mouth clean with understated oak notes; not taxing or tiring and a long finish of teaberry and mint. Nothing amazing or overly complex but a clean pleasant sip of whiskey. Sourced whiskey."
2166,11,"A 100% rye whiskey made from rye grown about 30 miles from Mississippi River Distilling. Strongly spicy and oily rye character reaching out of the glass and grabbing my nose; some surprising pastry and molasses notes hiding in there. The 40% mildness is disappointing at first but develops into a spicy minty mouth-filler with a cleanly sweet finish. On the sweet side would prefer it drier."
2167,11,"Strong bold aromas of rye grain fruit (raspberries black grapes) and dry cinnamon. Punchy rye on the tongue starts 42% tame but quickly catches fire roaring toward a barnburner of a finish. As the fire dies down you find cocoa and rye oil in the embers. This young (12 month) rye is small-barrel shouty but the roots are good. Solid effort."
2168,11,"Smells sweet and minty with gobs of oak and corn…and that’s about how it tastes too. The corn sweetness and the mint are dominant but warming oak spice wraps it loosely. It’s called “Young Bourbon” (labeled as “age under 4 years”) and that’s just what it tastes like as some green youthful notes muscle their way in toward the finish. A bit of a rough-rider but tasty."
2169,11,"Aggressive nose of bitter orange dark chocolate and pine comes boiling out of the glass. More gentle on the palate: the same notes but wrapped in sweet malt. A bit hot and crinkly on the tongue an assertive whisky but it fades quickly at the end. Good flavor but a lack of depth; everything Defiant has is right there on top there’s nothing to discover. The pine is off-putting too; not sure where that’s coming from."
2170,11,"Aged in new charred oak then finished in “white wine-seasoned French oak.” Tight sawdusty bitter nose. A lot of wood here going in different directions. First hit is the American oak (vanilla rich spice) followed quickly by creamy French oak then comes a wave of fruity wine wood character. Full in the mouth and a thick finish. Interesting but not particularly well integrated; maybe a case of “just because you can doesn’t mean you should.” Sourced whiskey."
2171,11,"Clean nose hard grain some grassy sweetness a bit perfumey. Interesting on the tongue: grain sweet orange and meadow grass; has a pleasantly creamy texture. Gets just a bit solvent-touched at the finish but overall an interesting sip…which brings up the question again: what are these ‘white whiskeys’ for? Cocktails highballs neat sipping? This one I think could pull off all three the kind of white whiskey that compares to white rum. Sourced whiskey."
2172,8,"Sweet and simple candied nose. Palate is thin bright and lemony like a fluffy mouthful of sweet marshmallows with hints of banana circus peanuts candy and gingery spice. Not especially complex but pleasant enough."
2173,8,"The oak is nicely subdued and integrated here allowing buttered fruits to show through—baked spiced apple and poached pear—laced with spearmint and bay leaf. The creamy palate is nicely balanced with baking spices of cinnamon and clove and hints of pepper giving way to a pleasantly drying chalky finish. Price is per 375 ml."
2174,8,"A coppery auburn color betrays small barrels in this case just ten gallons. The distinctive aroma of sassafras recalls rolling in a pile of autumn leaves then quickly gives way to the apparent spice of a high-rye mashbill. The earthy and spicy qualities meld nicely developing cedar box and sandalwood wrapped in the sweetness of maple syrup while the palate feels slick and buttery before a finish lingering with cinnamon and warm oatmeal cookie."
2175,8,"Deep golden in color with a pinkish cast this shows good purity of fruit with red berry black cherry toasty oak and some oxidative nutty notes layered across a creamy malty palate. A nice grilled-fruit palate echoes with sweetness and charcoal smoke on the long finish. The sherry contributes a lot of nice character but without more overall maturity feels a bit like window dressing."
2176,8,"Made with 100% rye aged up to 5 years this starts off surprisingly fruit-forward with poached pear and zesty clove-pierced citrus though the wood is beginning to dominate. The palate fires up the rye spice underscored by cocoa turning hot with some adhesive notes and finishing with fresh cereal grain and bitter oak tannins. A wood lover’s whiskey."
2177,8,"Pretty fruit gets swept up in distinct anise and fennel-bulb aromas with hints of mint and quinine backed by vanilla. Very soft creamy and rounded on the palate the peachy stone fruit comes nicely balanced with oak sweet vanilla and glimmers of nutmeg and clove spices before the cocoa powder finish. Well-constructed smooth and easy-drinking with a pleasant persistence of fruit."
2178,11,"Unaged. Richly sweet with corn and a bit of new make funk. Replicated very closely on the tongue: alcohol heat corn sweetness wild flowers/stems and faint notes of overripe fruit with some drying minerality on the finish. Interesting where it’s not clean; a balance of craft and cunning."
2179,11,"There’s a hot brittle nose of sweet spice like a cinnamon Red Hot floating in alcohol with a softer backing of cornmeal underneath. This is a well-behaved bourbon in the mouth; no off-flavors easy to hold on the tongue with more corn than spice now and a lack of wood until the finish when it wraps in on the corn to dry things up a bit. Simple sweet a little spicy and really easy to drink; a good start."
2180,11,"Made by ex-Dickel distiller John Lunn at the brand's new distillery a new bottling new name. “Distilled from grain and sugar.” Smells like clean white dog: warm ripe melon alcohol heat grain. Smoothly drinkable not hot or astringent. Simple sweet: melon cooked grain. Sweeter than vodka and a bit more flavorful but otherwise pretty similar. I still don't get the attraction."
2181,11,"Onyx (East Hartford Conn.) ages their 'moonshine' in new charred oak barrels to make this expression.  Nose is fresh-sawn oak and sugar cookies with a bit of cinnamon spice. Tons of fresh oak in the mouth (I'd guess this is small-barrel whiskey) with a spicy sweetness a hallmark of young craft whiskey as is the quick finish. Still no real flaws and pleasant enough."
2182,11,"I reviewed a couple of these one-off Wigle Whims earlier. This one’s quite roasty indeed almost coffee-like made with roasted barley and wheat and caramel and chocolate malts. It smells of burnt grain with sweet toffee underneath. Lots of chocolate and cocoa struggle with ash and burnt grain leading to a hot finish where they end up finally in agreement a smoky mocha mouthful espresso whiskey. Invigorating. Price is per 375 ml."
2183,11,"Like the other Taos Lightning Rye there’s an MGP provenance that’s topped with local aging; it is stated to be a 5 year old whiskey. There’s the signature brittle-dry mint of this mashbill some hot oak and shortbread. The mouth is quick spicy and hot but not over-balanced in any direction. Good but not setting off the shock and awe."
2184,11,"An estate white whiskey: the corn in this spirit was all grown and harvested on the Myer farm a Finger Lakes farm dating back to the 1860s. The nose is clean and green a focused blast of unmodified corn. The spirit is zesty and fresh sweet and grassy/minty; easy to hold on the tongue until a final heat that fires the finish. If the finish were a bit smoother…still quite good for unaged whiskey."
2185,11,"Unaged corn whiskey from Philadelphia. The distinctive white corn spirit smell: crushed corn leaves wet cornmeal hint of fruit and split stone. A singular flavor though: the usual flabby green sweetness isn’t here. Instead there’s a dry solid corn flavor something that tastes complete arrived. I could ask for more complexity but the focused dry intensity of it has a singular appeal asking only ice — or a lager chaser — to make a great afternoon."
2186,11,"Quite dark brown in the glass and lots of vanilla and fruit — white grapes pear — in the nose with a sweet clean floral character as well; a rich nose. Vibrant with malt and vanilla in the mouth rather hot without water and shot through with oakspice which dominates the finish though the vanilla struggles through. Water helps the heat in the middle but not the finish. Texas is pretty darned hot!"
2187,11,"Mashbill of corn smoked barley rye and wheat and a ruddy almost garnet color to it. Smells like barrel drool in a rickhouse; kinda raunchy and sweet with broad notes of vanilla and hot corn. Quite a mouthful at 100 proof and after a short initial wave of sweet the smoke shouts through squeezing and wringing the other flavors dry right through the finish. Water makes it paradoxically hotter."
2188,11,"A restrained nose of fresh-cut oak grassy rye and a fleeting trace of solvents. Quite sweet in the mouth spicy and minty and the alcohol is fiery: this is young rye. Still it's much less forward and rudely insistent than I'd expected; not at all the ripsnorter some young ryes are. This could be pleasant but the finish is a letdown: sweet mealy uninspiring."
2189,11,"Sharp nose of fresh wet grain hot honey a little butterscotch crushed boxwood leaves and a touch of linseed; an herbal smell. Mouth is roundly sweet with honey and pie crust notes that meet the oak and pretty it up. There’s mint here which surprised me; maybe from the wood? This one’s dainty delicate and maybe a bit too sweet but it maintains an edge of oak that keeps it serious. Price is per 375 ml."
2190,11,"The second craft rye I’m revisiting. Mosby’s is still 100% organic rye and unaged but the nose is more fun: some green pear and melon esters in there with the grassy rye spice. It’s nicely smooth on the tongue delivers exactly what the nose promised plus a shot of fresh-cracked black pepper…and a much longer finish these days. Greatly improved; a good white whiskey."
2191,11,"Malt whiskey with a mashbill similar to a craft-brewed stout—think dark roasted malts—and then aged in new charred oak with an addition of toasted French oak. The nose is sweet young malt touched with chocolate. There’s an additional hit of cocoa at first taste then heat oak vanilla and more sweet malt followed by a finish that’s increasingly chocolatey and dry. Young and could use more complexity and maturing but full of good flavors. Price is per 375 ml."
2192,8,"Very oaky with a nose of fresh sawdust but beneath lurk deep maple sweetness pralines and cherry cough drop. The palate is chewy sweet and nutty with pleasing caramel and butterscotch but is hurt by some peculiar varnish and furniture polish notes. Finishes with cherry leather and more oak."
2193,8,"The rye spice on the nose is big broad and aromatic with allspice and clove in the mix but there are some distillation issues with a slight rubber-tire note of feints. Rich and viscous on the palate it’s slightly hot but shows really lovely spice and toasted nuts turning oak-dominated on the finish."
2194,11,"Label says “Dunkel” release says “Dunkelweizen” two very different beers. Mostly strong sawn oak on the nose with some clove (so maybe Dunkelweizen is closer). Springy spicy and a bit oily on the tongue; German gingerbread on the finish. (375 ml.)"
2195,11,"MGP-sourced bourbon is finished in Madeira barriques and shows a nicely reddish color. Nose is corn and wine gums; not hot not sweet. Flash-hot in the mouth light body and some candy and minerality with the corn; a prickly heat and acidity at the end but overall more pleasant than that sounds."
2196,11,"Corn and oak on the nose with a slice of fruit from sherry cask aging. Nose is strikingly different from the other two Hillrocks reviewed; sweeter and softer. It’s clearly bourbon at the front but as the flavors move back in the mouth and into the finish the sherry takes over and dominates becoming quite fruity at the close though with a firm grip of charred oak. The sherry’s too much for a bourbon especially at this price. Partially sourced whiskey."
2197,11,"Part of this Pittsburgh distillery’s series of “Whims” one-offs. Truly interesting nose: a combination of new-barrel bourbon reek and Irish raw barley grassiness yielding mint vanilla juicy wet grain and faint cinnamon. Hot entry of vanilla and small-barrel oak which suddenly collapses to a dry cocoa sweetness spiked with hot pepper like Mexican chocolate. This typifies a lot of craft efforts: not a great whiskey now but one with terrifically interesting potential. I hope Wigle pursues this Whim. Price is per 375 ml."
2198,11,"Wheat whiskey finished in huckleberry port barrels showing a deep reddish blush purple-pink around the edges. The fruity richness of the portwood is subdued but present and lays across everything else in the nose. Things become less one-dimensional on the palate and the sweet broad grassiness of the wheat lightens the portwood influence somewhat but it comes back in the finish. It’s a decent combo but a bit of a one-note song. Price is per 375ml."
2199,11,"Made in Washington State with Washington barley in a copper pot still and aged “over a year” in new charred 10 gallon oak barrels. Good color; nose is frisky and young with fresh oak and big pear aromas and a hot feel. Hot and direct in the mouth: grainy some of that pear and a somewhat bland but appealing cereal sweetness. Finish is more of the same with a flick of heat at the end."
2200,8,"Pleasantly aromatic of oranges and dusty oak turning more oily chewy and nutty on the palate with honeycomb intensity. However the tannins are quite aggressive suggesting green walnut hulls and wooden popsicle stick."
2201,8,"Fresh and distinctly grain driven like slurping warm breakfast cereal but that malt purity also comes at the expense of complexity and development with lots of grassy meadow cut hay notes that lead to a palate of husky grain and honeyed malt before a finish sweet young grass notes."
2202,8,"Soft creamy and corn-driven with sweet stone fruit and char aromas up front. The palate delivers on the nose; simple direct and enjoyable pleasantly soft and creamy then turning slightly nutty with sweet praline sweetness and a touch of cocoa. While lacking in complexity and verve it shows smoothness for a whiskey aged less than 2 years."
2203,8,"Starts off quite confectionary with sweet top notes of vanilla crème caramel and violets. The palate flaunts its brash youth showing lots of primary new make whiskey character while carrying its 100 proof surprisingly well for such a young whiskey (aged less than 1 year) as the cereal grain cinnamon spice generous sweetness and charcoal power through the palate. Young potent and unapologetic."
2204,8,"Despite the orange-amber color green stalky corn husk and bramble notes dominate this youngster with secondary flavors of fruitwood smoke and warm cereal. The flavors are beginning to evolve nicely on the palate as the fresh malt meets lots of dark chocolate before a savory snap of green stick returns on the finish. Malted barley malted rye and malted wheat."
2205,11,"A Seven Stills and Pacific Brewing Laboratory collaboration: a distilled double IPA. Broiled grapefruit and caramel with a razory lightness but a bit muddled. Flavors of sweet malt and maple pierced in a needle-row with bitter hop resins pine pith; malt/hop/malt/hop comes in quick waves. Like some double IPAs this is a blunt instrument that simply walks up and wallops you with hops and malt; neither subtle nor particularly complex. Hop fans may well love it; others will not. Price is per 375 ml."
2206,11,"The “(SB)2RW” stands for “small batch small barrel rye whiskey.” Smells like it: small barrel fresh-cut oak smell clove cigarettes and a fair amount of heat. A bit thin on the tongue with a medicinal bite of rye grass warming heat and some sweetness and the medicinal part expands into the finish."
2207,11,"Aged 6 to 7 months in quarter barrels. Sharpish oaky nose with a sweet grain/golden syrup backing. Spirity in the mouth with a big slap of young oak up front that quickly subsides yielding sweet corn muffin white pepper and dry cocoa that linger into the finish. Hot but worth the burn. Some nice components here; age and a bigger barrel could do a better job on integration."
2208,11,"Beautiful little bottle and label. 100% rye aged 2 years in 53-gallon heavy char oak barrels. Smells right: rye spice orange candies and oaky vanilla. Light body quite hot and the sweetness comes through but the rye really turns it up as the liquid spreads on the tongue and warms. Some plastic hints high in the mouth. Promising but not there yet; part of the problem with big barrels."
2209,11,"Nose is a bit perfumed like doilies at grandma's house with grain grass and meadow notes. Flavor is minty rye-bitter and penetrating; finish is sweet and hot with more grassiness. Powerful rye influence; not much corn and that perfume note is odd but the rye is gripping."
2210,8,"Grassy notes and damp hay define the aroma of this young bourbon while the palate offers good citrus and orchard fruits. However there is a varnish note and stalky green character that hold it back. Needs time."
2211,11,"Take the Charbay R5 Clear and add some vanilla and toast notes: interesting. The flavors…on first sip the mellowing richness of the oak makes for a nice entry. But the wood blunts the zip of the hoppy beer wash without adding enough to compensate for the loss and makes for a hotter finish. It’s still interesting but the wood gets in the way of what this can be."
2212,11,"Wow that's a small barrel whiskey! Only 2 years old and more like 12 years dark with a nose stuffed full of oak char steamy mint and hot vanilla. You know it's wheat in the mouth; despite the aggressive nose and the heat you do get this is still pretty friendly stuff for 50%: sweet dough mint and more oak. But the finish roars in real hot and a bit astringent ruining the moment and water doesn't help."
2213,11,"Simple nose of corn oak cinnamon candy and ash. Candy sweet grainy still simple and a bit thin; increasingly hot at the end. Needs more breadth and depth but there’s nothing seriously flawed. I’d characterize this as a good flyweight boxer caught in a cruiserweight bout; nice footwork solid performance and dealing some good hits but the bigger older bourbons give it a palate-pounding. Price is per 375 ml."
2214,11,"Fresh oak nose with hard candies and bitter grass notes. Much less oaky on the tongue but the hard candies—spicy-sweet a bit hot—burst in the mouth leading down to a warm pastry-sweet finish with a wreathing of ashes. Boozy and warm and a bit simple but quite drinkable for a young bourbon."
2215,8,"The first legal rye from Delaware since Prohibition includes 65% rye and also 5% rye malt. Although showing some spirituous aromas of youth this is one of the more precocious small barrel projects (10 gallon) with its sweet cinnamon candy and rye bread notes turning still spicier on the palate. Not terribly complex but enjoyable."
2216,11,"Nose is tight closed what’s there is like a raisin bun; softly sweet pastry and dried fruit. Gentle in the mouth warming but not hot; still like the pastry but with oak framing and some nuts and a hint of anise. (375 ml.)"
2217,11,"A 100% rye unaged “white whiskey.” Nose is fruity—pear apple black raspberry—and peppery with a mineral edge to it like fresh-cracked stone. Creamy sweet mouth repeating the fruits in half-voice with a sharp alcoholic heat. Sweetness makes me curious about the fermentation attenuation…but this would be good with seltzer."
2218,11,"All local Colorado malt with a little peat-smoked malt. Unaged. No smoke on the nose; fresh a bit feinty wet and juicy melon a hint of cardamom. Smoke is there as it hits the tongue immediate but gentle. Spirit tastes much cleaner than it smells. Hot on the tongue prickly. More melon and spice on the finish a bit creamy. Not a bad white but quite pricey. Price is per 375 ml."
2219,11,"Very sweet and simple aroma like plain jelly beans with only a whisper of the heat you’d expect at 45%. Better on the tongue; proper heat some cornpone a bed of oak. Smooth good balance good finish. Nothing stands out but nicely made. Loses points on the nose and typifies the Small Producer Dilemma: why bottle a good bourbon? Beam and Heaven Hill do that already cheaper than you ever will. Sourced whiskey."
2220,11,"Sweet and a bit funky; maybe a wisp of smoke maybe some green cornstalk and some mint/vanilla. Rippling and vibrant in the mouth hot and bold and not candy-sweet at all more like fuel-injected cornbread with a splash of burning mint eau de vie across the top. Or maybe that’s just the AC/DC talking; maybe I should review to Mozart. Not bad but I think I like the simpler unaged version."
2221,11,"A blend of aged (sourced) bourbon and Great Lakes’ own (young) malt whiskey. Quite sweet on the nose; a rich herbal sweetness with a strong youthful quality to it. Interestingly medicinal on the tongue as the herbal character swells. A full mouthfeel with clear references to new make about it: a bit oily grassy and bright. The finish is the best part: minty and a bit drying a pleasant farewell. Interesting concept."
2222,11,"A hot wash of vanilla and sweet cloves and cinnamon with shouty alcohol heat and a log of oak; whatever else this is ‘subtle’ is not on the menu. Wow is that hot in the mouth! Still it’s flavorful with it; cinnamon candy and corn on the cob gush onto the palate. There are some cobby notes though and a bit of mustiness. The finish is—surprise!—hot and fades reluctantly. Doc Bryson prescribes more time in a large barrel."
2223,11,"Quite mild on the nose for 99 proof: dry oak light honey crisp corn. It all fires up in the mouth a thick wash of hot oak and corn—attic whiskey—white pepper and a tongue-crinkling woodiness leading to a drying finish that leaves you thirsty and swallowing as it fades. This may only be 6 years old (according to the label) but they were hot years. Better with a bit of water. (sourced whiskey)"
2224,11,"Unaged triple distilled spirit produced and bottled at Piedmont Distillers in North Carolina. Clean nose with hints of unripe honeydew bond paper and wet crushed chalk. Very soft on the palate clean with no burn at all. Slippery-smooth a tiny bit sweet. Tastes like good vodka really; not much grain here at all. Easy to drink but…where’s the excitement?"
2225,11,"Mason jar packaging makes for an awkward pour; had to be said. Nose is hot with a fruity sweetness and fainter notes of grassy green corn flowers and rock. Clean and sweet with more corn character here along with other fresh grains. Not nasty not bad but seems to be mostly aimed as a base for Palmetto’s apple pie and peach flavors. Otherwise…it’s sweet corn-tinged vodka."
2226,8,"This whiskey pours light sweet and pure with fresh bread and honeyed malt up front while displaying some evident youth to the spirit. The palate offers warm cereals floral notes Bit-O-Honey candy and malty sweetness on the palate. Not especially complex but delicate clean and pretty."
2227,8,"Rich copper in color following just 55 weeks in a 17-gallon barrel at low proof (106.2) this whiskey is caught between youth and ambition as flavors of leathery oak earth dried apple and dates emerge to meet green twigs and briar and some musty basement. Generous and broad-shouldered this rye aims high with solid structure and robust spice but is overwhelmed by dusty bitterly tannic oak on the finish."
2228,11,"A locally-grown mashbill of 75% barley 20% malt 5% oats. Very aromatic for unaged spirit: fresh grainy a bit feinty/vegetal split rock and a note like well-rinsed crisp sauerkraut. It’s a quick and lively one in the mouth sweet and slippery grain and hints of fresh herbs (fennel mace white peppercorn). The finish is a bit sticky—the oats maybe—and sweet. Interesting stuff."
2229,11,"Bottle 170 of this Delaware distillery’s first batch. Full oily aroma of sweet wet crushed corn; almost too rich. Very clean on the palate; light and sweet a bit of dry leafiness. Impressive first effort. (Delaware only)"
2230,7,"A blend of 94% rye-mash whiskey and Virgil Kane's High-Rye Bourbon (60% corn 36% rye and 4% barley). Floral rye grain spice bursts from the nose along with cedar plank and graphite. The entry is thick and sweet with maple syrup young oak and rye spice. Things don't heat up until the end of the mid-palate where a dash of heat drives a long spicy finish. An interesting mix of flavors that could benefit from a little more complexity."
2231,11,"Unaged spirit and smells like it: rich grain a bit of loose-cut funkiness. Quite sweet in the mouth more body than usual. Some oiliness hints of cocoa and pastry and a hint of something like bamboo shoots. Not as clean as some unaged spirit...but not as dull as some either."
2232,11,"Wood-smoked malt a spirit aged in oak with fruitwood chips added makes for a distinctive idiosyncratic whisky. Nose is warehouse reek mellow fruitwood smoke and sweet light pipe tobacco with a slight hint of cinnamon. Mouth is hot but soft with lots of malt and that unfamiliar flow of fruitwood smoke. Thin and edgy up front but as the smoke spreads and the malt sweetens it evolves. Finish is a bit abrupt."
2233,11,"The name is a reference to the “whisk(e)y” convention; this is a malt spirit aged in a used American rye whiskey barrel. Light amber. Light nose of baker's chocolate barrel fruit candy and boiled frosting. Spicy and prickly on the tongue (the rye?) with calming influence from the barrel. A lively swallow sweet spicy a whack of cut lumber and the sweetness of young malt. But there's a roughness that's not all fun; good spirit needs more taming."
2234,11,"Well they got the proof right! From JEM Beverage (Carrollton Texas). Sweet cedar and citrus in the nose dominant and one-noted. Sweet on the tongue with that fresh green cedar character and more sweet citrus; a touch of oak in the finish. Not a lot else."
2235,11,"Furniture polish red raspberries popovers a vigorous nose going in several directions. Hot grainy mouth not overwhelmed by wood; a simple grain finish like twice-baked biscuits with a light wreathing of meadow mint. The character of the grain comes through quite clearly and it’s distinctly different from the Myer Rye. But what’s here is not particularly interesting or well-integrated."
2236,8,"An unusual style made from 100% wheat. Hints of stone fruit brown apples and molasses come cloaked in earthy aromas of saddle leather woodpile and husky grain. Shows well for its age and quite smooth but the oak dominates and aromas seem dulled with vanilla oak bitterness and dark chocolate on the finish."
2237,11,"As mentioned in my column this issue Stillhouse is packaged in a stainless steel can much like the ones used for paint thinner. Labeled “100% corn whiskey.” Clean scent of corn green corn stalks and apples. Very similar on the tongue with just a hint of burn. For what it is this is not bad; clean tasty definitely a good mixer. They have several flavored versions as well. Sourced whiskey."
2238,11,"Riffing on the German smoked beer type. Light smoke and caramel on the nose. Very grassy front the smoke slips in toward the middle and it all ends up a bit confused like dessert served in an ashtray. (375 ml.)"
2239,11,"A “whiskey distilled from rye malt mash” which indicates aging in used barrels. Still has a deep coloring from port barrel finishing. Nose is quite peppery youthfully vegetal and sweet with fruit again presumably from the port barrel. Rye grassiness and spice in the mouth wrapped with layers of port fruit and pepperiness that roll into the finish. Smooth for the strength though the port is pushy and the flavors could be better balanced. An interesting direction."
2240,11,"Another experimental “Whims” bottlings; this one is 95% malted rye and 5% malted barley. Nose is sharp with notes of cinnamon candies and a bit of solvents. Better on the palate: a cooling breeze of minty rye some citrus and growing bitter rye oil as it finishes. Fairly simple pleasant stuff but the nose is not inviting. Price is per 375 ml."
2241,11,"Dry dusty corn with some fruit flashing around and an odd aroma of cracked limestone. Simple corn spirit lightly sweet and clean not hot (especially for 50%) and a smooth finish. As the company notes this is a spirit for mixing but it’s a surprisingly easy sipper if not overly rewarding."
2242,11,"Interesting: “Bottled by The Tennessee Spirits Company Pewaukee WI.” Woody nose spiked with dry rye spiciness: black pepper dried mint. My that’s hot. It’s a rye rocket and the wood’s drying up every bit of sweet here leaving my tongue wrinkly. A bit of water though and this is a much happier whiskey; softer sweeter notes come out and the mint cheers up. (sourced whiskey)"
2243,11,"Distilled from an almost extinct strain of heirloom corn (Crooked Creek) this is a fully aromatic white whiskey: fresh white corn crisp apple and pear float high over the liquid. A soft mouth—not overly hot—brings the fruit but the corn is a solid underpinning. There’s a dry almost mineral component to the finish. No flaws interesting flavors and nicely integrated for an unaged spirit."
2244,11,"Not a lot of details offered past the “Cane • Corn Spirit” and “aged in oak for 2 years” on the label and talk of a “honey mixture.” Color is medium-amber; smell is thin sweet and lightly fruity. Not unpleasant in the mouth; candy-sweet maybe a bit bland and an ashy hint. The finish does have a little ‘bit-o-honey’ flavor that hangs high for a long time. Overall not bad but not real exciting either."
2245,8,"Fruit driven with banana and circus peanuts candies florals and violet candies this turns more peppery and minty on the palate where warm cereal meets some varnish notes with a bit of heat and slight bitterness that makes it feel a bit rough around the edges. 100% Montana and Canada rye aged 2 years in full-sized barrels."
2246,8,"Generously oaky with sawdust horse saddle vanilla honey and a chalky mineral quality on the nose. The palate is mouth-coating with a full-bodied punch of sweet fruit caramel treacle and heat but even with dilution the astringent wood tannins chalk dust and dry leathery finish come on too quickly. The rare craft bourbon that might have been better a bit younger. (Loch & K(e)y exclusive)"
2247,8,"Initial aromas of boiled corncob sugarcane stalks and burnt sugar give a suggestion of youth and slight bitterness. Dig a little deeper and the secondary flavors of honeyed fruit green apple lavender vanilla and fresh oak reveal potential. While clearly young there is still a lot to admire in this soft and delicate wheated bourbon with its hints of smoke and a mouthwatering saltwater taffy finish possibly derived from aging in floating boathouses on Puget Sound. 375ml"
2248,8,"Distilled from corn malted barley rye and flaked rye and aged in small barrels with toasted orangewood chips. While this whiskey smacks of its youth with green flavors of burnt cane stalks wrapped in orange blossom honey and charred marshmallow there is something compelling about its primary spirit quality freshness and sincerity. A fine example of what it aims to be—young small-barrel whiskey."
2249,7,"The American craft whiskey movement has produced some unique riffs on classic spirits. Here we get a classic Irish-type whiskey made in Tennessee and aged in small 15-gallon barrels. It’s all lush Irish on the nose with caramel green apple dark chocolate oak. On the palate the oak from the small barrel overtakes caramel apple with its smoky barrel char sawdust and clove spice. An interesting idea but perhaps better realized in larger or used barrels."
2250,11,"The malt was “lightly smoked” with a 60/40 mix of apple and cherry woods. It is very light in the nose which gives a fruitbowl—apple white grape pear—topped with wet malt and just a hint of that smoke. Very hot as expected but the smoke is more pronounced with a creamy texture. Water brings out more malt and notes of cocoa ripe Red Delicious apple and nuts…and a somewhat rough finish. Interesting and mixable."
2251,11,"Another “green malt” whiskey from Coppersea a method they found in an old Scottish text for making whiskey from unkilned malt. This is much more vegetal than the rye (reviewed in Summer 2014); rank grass aroma with a sweetness behind it without the lovely complexity of the rye. Bitter and stemmy; hot and sweet as it closes. I much prefer the rye."
2252,11,"Woodsy wet leaves and fallen trees dry grain bin and fresh-cut cherrywood aromas. Cherry and dark plum up front passing through to cocoa and wood and chocolate-cherry candy on the end...none of which tastes like anything I'd call “bourbon” until the very last whisper of the finish. How do you make bourbon without a hint of corn or oak to it? Some strange ideas here."
2253,7,"The bottle states “Aged less than four years” but the nose says probably less than two. Unseasoned oak and sawdust dominate the nose. If you can get through the oak you’ll find honey corn cinnamon and beef jerky. On the palate it’s dry cornmeal caramel and a hefty portion of abrasive oak. The mid-palate is big spice with cinnamon black pepper clove and oak. A short dry finish puts a bow on a whiskey that’s overly tannic dry and oaky."
2254,11,"Light brown sugar orange candy and cinnamon on the nose along with just a hint of funk. Electric in the mouth zapping out to every corner and tooth with bitter oils and hot alcohol with a backing wall of corn sweetness. The finish is almost a relief. Take the rattlesnake graphic as a warning; this one's not kidding."
2255,11,"Fiery young stuff! The nose is spicy/slicey with a sharp sweetness fresh oak and a hint of solvent. A lot of oak in the mouth almost drying and just a bit astringent on the tongue. The finish turns softer sweeter but stays oaky. The wood’s a bit overwhelming on this one. It’s sourced whiskey that’s then finished in Long Island wine barrels. Some finishes work better than others."
2256,8,"Lots of char and burnt sugar on the nose leading to some sweet fruit on the palate with coffee and mocha on the finish. Vanilla cream candies are overwhelmed by a woodpile of oak drying tannins and heat that lack balance. Multiple tastings with consistent results."
2257,11,"There’s the sweet reek of new make: barely ripe apricot and peach green grain a hint of spice. The spirit is surprisingly dry with shots of grain pepper and some clean alcohol notes on the top but a well-mannered 100 proof indeed and easy to hold on the tongue. There’s a dry twist of anise on the finish. An interesting — and promising — white whiskey. (Pennsylvania only.)"
2258,11,"Distilled from an oatmeal stout with a shot of peat this intrigued even before the cap popped. It does smell like an oatmeal stout: cocoa grains fresh bread restrained smoke mixed with small-barrel oak. The smoke blows up in the mouth much more evident and the chocolaty honey-sweet base rolls underneath…but it’s shallow without the richness of a properly-aged scotch. Craft whiskeys want to grow up so fast but this is like a kid in his dad’s clothes. (400 bottles only) Price is per 375 ml."
2259,11,"Craft beer whiskey: mashbill of 80% malt/20% rye malt fermented with a Belgian ale yeast that yields spicy aromas. Nose is mostly young oak like a small barrel whiskey but there are some subtle spice notes and sweet malt. Creamy mouth sweet but not sticky and the orange and spice I’m picking up are likely from that yeast. Body is luscious; best part of the whiskey because the finish turns prickly. There’s promise here but delivery’s delayed. Price is per 375 ml."
2260,8,"Aromas hint at a bitterly astringent almost burnt sugar smell like green walnut hulls. While the body is full and rich it’s simply too hot and young to make for pleasant drinking. The finish is long and spicy but needs more time to mellow."
2261,11,"Small barrel-type aromas: sharp fresh oak and hot grain but also cocoa hulls and coffee grounds. Tastes youthfully hot and chocolatey and sweet and the oak is raw and forward. More chocolate than stout I think. (375 ml.)"
2262,11,"Quite dark for 4 year old whiskey. Nose is fierce unrestrained by the glass and full of caramel baking spices and dusty corn. It’s hot and oaky but dominated by a broad cornmeal placidity that keeps the flaming oak well in check. Water brings out mint but brings a cloying edge to the corn; it’s better hot and rocking. A huge evaporative loss made for a tiny yield but even so the price just seems crazy."
2263,7,"Lots of green notes in the nose of this mason jar variety of moonshine including green apple green bean and wheat grass. Strong brewer’s yeast and cornmeal round things out in a highly aromatic nose. For the proof the entry is remarkably soft and sweet tasting like buttered cornbread. Fire and spice aren’t far behind with black pepper white pepper and charred Cracker Jack. Long dry and slightly hot finish with a hint of popcorn and green bean."
2264,7,"Pale gold in color this whiskey is noticeably cloudy even in a warm room. Swift's nose is pleasant with malt honey and butterscotch. The entry is exceptionally thin with a hint of malt and honey but there's not much to it. In the mid-palate it’s all about the bourbon barrel so much so that the overall character shifts toward corn whiskey. A short finish with chocolate notes wraps up a whiskey that just doesn’t have much to say."
2265,11,"Does this belong here at 70% cane sugar and 30% corn/wheat? The process sure looks like whiskey so we’ll let it slip in. The aroma’s sweet but with a solvent rim to it. For 105 proof this is pretty smooth stuff in the mouth. There are notes of melon and green corn and a wet hint of fresh grass before the burner kicks on at the finish. It’s a hot end on this one but not unpleasant."
2266,11,"New make fruit—pear stewed apple—and rye spice in a hot clean nose. That’s pretty much what you get in the mouth too with some dry paper notes and a sweet finish. For some reason I really want to try mixing this with Dr. Pepper. This is definitely a mixing spirit mountain-style."
2433,10,"A good hit of woodsmoke some coastal character black cherry and ground black pepper but there is a sulfurous note with a hint of rubber gloves. The perfectly placid palate of citrus and caramel is disrupted by an angry swarm of pepper which eventually dies away leaving behind more smoke and hints of hazelnut. A mouth-watering finish of orange candy and pepper."
2267,7,"Buttered popcorn combines with wet pavement vanilla and black pepper for an interesting but edgy nose. The entry is light and sweet with vanilla and buttered corn and a silky smooth mouthfeel. The mid-palate thins things out a bit and shifts focus to strong black pepper. This black pepper drives a spicy and dry finish. Many white whiskies straddle the line between whisky and vodka and this one edges a little too close to the vodka space."
2268,11,"Like the Whim Mocha Porter this is certified organic; a wheat whiskey made with locally-grown hops. Hard to tease out hops vs. small barrel oak spice in the nose; it’s bold and shouty. Wow. The hops are explosive in the mouth flashing bitter on the tongue. The first sip was shocking now it’s settling in and becoming smoother but I just don’t think this much hops is a good idea in a whiskey. Price is per 375 ml."
2269,11,"Small barrel whiskey 100% corn. Rich sweet oaky nose with—at first—notes of peppermint and Rice Krispies treats; nose collapses and becomes sharp woody burnt. Fiery mouth smoky notes dry wood and hot mint are overwhelming and somewhat astringent. Finish lingers much longer than would be pleasant; hot and tingly with a redeeming core of corn. Tastes like it was pushed hard to be done."
2270,7,"Big Bottom finishes their light-style Barlow Trail whiskey in 10 year old tawny port casks. On the nose it's promising with oak blackberry jam orange vanilla and rye spice. The entry is soft and light with vanilla and berry but it shifts dramatically in the mid-palate which is exceptionally spicy and dry. Big Bottom’s previous port cask finishes have been blockbusters but the light-style Barlow Trail whiskey doesn't have the same level of balance and integration to prevail."
2271,11,"Caramel brown sugar vanilla generic sweetness. Smooth entry and more of the same on the tongue with some alcohol heat in the finish. Very little wood at all. Begging to be poured into Coke. Maybe most jarring is that the Hatfield & McCoy “brand” recalls the infamous feud that took place on the Kentucky-West Virginia border…while this was distilled in South Carolina. At least the label’s honest as far as that. Sourced whiskey."
2272,11,"Plainly states it’s “aged four months in a small oak barrel.” Tame nose; working hard to pull out anything other than alcohol heat some fresh-cut wet wood and wet cereal. Quite hot with lots of wet oak sawdust and sweet cinnamon that rocket right into the finish. Reminds me of a young teenager running around shouting at inappropriate moments and very excited. Too young and hot right now. Put it back in the barrel; maybe a larger one. Price is per 375 ml."
2273,8,"Campfire smoke fusel notes green twigs and rhum agricole give a rustic edge to this big and broad-shouldered whiskey. Full-bodied with an attitude the sweet clover honey oily character  and lingering burnt sugar bitterness feel a bit disjointed. Pot distilled and aged in charred oak for 3 years."
2274,11,"From TerrePure; there’s that reassuring note on the label that the whiskey is “Aged at least six months.” Nose is somewhat flat compressed; diner mints old cinnamon sticks cattle feed. Tastes thin sweet hot and not very complex. There’s a flash of something more just before the swallow: corn hot mint. But it vanishes in a bland quick finish. Uninspiring if surprisingly smooth for 6 month old whiskey."
2275,7,"Although this moonshine may look down-home in a mason jar it was produced using the highly technical TerrePure process designed to remove most congeners. The result is a corn neutral spirit that doesn’t smell or taste much like corn. Instead it’s soft vanilla toasted marshmallow and a dash of salt. A little heat and white pepper round things out for a long peppery-dry finish. It’s pretty good for a vodka but is it really moonshine or white whiskey? Probably not."
2276,11,"Berkshire Mountain Distillers uses locally grown corn here aged on local oak and cherry wood. The nose is sweet and sharp smelling of corn grass and tart cherries. Corn and ash dominate the hot slippery mouth with a finish that turns sweeter as it dwindles with some faint fruit notes but the heat is hard to overcome. If it were my corn I’d put it into the bourbon instead; this is a bit thin."
2277,7,"Aged one day in new American oak this white dog ekes out the very minimum requirements for bourbon. The nose is heavy barnyard complete with hay horse and manure. Beyond the funk is cornmeal cashew and apple blossom. The palate is light and what you'd expect with yeasty cornbread sour apple apple blossom and black pepper. The funk is still there but not as intense as on the nose. Interesting overall character with aging potential but for now it’s unbaked."
2278,11,"Extremely dark color; aged in ten-gallon barrels. A thick burbling nose full of dark aromas: smoke molasses earth and moist tobacco with a sharp woody twist around the outside. The mouth recapitulates much of that but in a brighter fashion…and then the small barrel takes over; tight intense wood that blows out everything else and leaves the tongue tingling. I find it hard to tease out any spirit character; what’s this whiskey taste like under the wood?"
2279,11,"Single barrel cask proof. Strong wood aromas; pencil shavings hot-sawn oak. Hot and tight intense wood. There’s some interesting stuff around the edges but the wood’s blocking it till some sweetness peeks through at the end. Water helps a little but not enough. Over-barreled."
2280,8,"There is a certain rusticity here with a nose rooted in rhum agricole sweet malt honeycomb butterscotch and molasses tinged with furniture polish and varnish notes. The palate is sweet and candied with Bit-O-Honey circus peanuts and nougat turning a touch chocolatey on the finish."
2281,11,"“Smoked” with a maceration of Lapsang Souchong tea (which leaves some fine sediment). Thickly sweet and herbal nose in a ruddy whiskey; like a sweetened aged genever. On the palate this 70% 7 year old MGP corn 30% unaged Two James rye is woody and ash-bitter in the core with a wrapping of that sweetness. The herbal character saves it from the squabble between sweet and bitter but it comes off more as a tonic than a whiskey."
2282,11,"Palmetto distillery has been making ‘moonshine’ products so far and now they have some spirit aged in new French oak. Aromas of sweet pastry dough new rubber horehound and bitter orange make for an intriguing nose. The mouth is fiery hot thin in body and tends to stay that way through to the end. The horehound blends with rye bitterness to make this a bit medicinal. Hot for sipping but should make a very good Old Fashioned."
2283,11,"There’s a somewhat oily faint green look to this in the bottle. Strong aroma of corn some green apple and a faint hint of smoke and wet dog. Tastes a bit medicinal with a smoky richness and a surprisingly full mouthfeel. Sweet finish adds to the general impression that this one needs cleaned up a bit…or demands a different approach."
2284,11,"Light amber color; no age statement not labeled as “straight whiskey.” Nose of spiced hard candies wet oak mint. Very hot mouth thin body muddled flavors of candy and wood. Quite young with a hot unpleasant finish. The unaged Lovell Bros. is both more enjoyable and more interesting."
2285,7,"Wood tannins are an interesting thing; used correctly they can help create spice depth and complexity as well as define a spirit's character. Unrestrained tannins can wreak havoc. That’s what’s happened with this whiskey. Sharp unfinished wood defines a nose that is raw in every sense. A thin entry struggles to present maple and caramel before a heavy blast of oak tannins decimates them. Those tannins define the rest of the taste experience including a sour and bitter finish."
2286,8,"Aged in a combination of 25-gallon and 53-gallon barrels Florida’s first bourbon since Prohibition is 16 to 28 months of age. The honor of being first comes with compromises—a youthful spirited profile with clear distillate lurking just beneath the heavy surface oak dried fruit and cocoa notes. Slightly hot earthy and leathery with Robusta coffee and oak astringency on the finish."
2287,11,"Made from 100% rye but aged in wine casks. Distinctly pink tinge: rosé whiskey. Very young nose: rye grain Starburst candies and feinty vegetable notes along with the wine-oak. Thin dry reminiscent of a dry hay barn: dusty grain warm wood planks a bit medicinal. Aged 130 days and tastes like it. Growing up in Pennsylvania Highspire was a town we stayed out of. Good advice."
2288,7,"An oddball whiskey by all accounts with a very high 72.2% of wheat in the mashbill distillation on an old farmhouse cognac still and aging in a little Oregon barn in 63-gallon new oak barrels. The result is a strange disjointed whiskey that starts out pillow-soft with wheat and caramel and then dramatically shifts to raw oak nougat and cinnamon stick. The flavors in Billy don’t integrate well: they're like a jazz band severely out of step."
2289,11,"Nasty smell of chicken coop: dried guano some ammonia and dust with grain underneath. Happily it tastes quite a bit better. Sweet grain snap of rye spice some dry cocoa powder but there's still a dustiness to it and a distinct small-barrel woodiness. Hard to get past that aroma. Seems like there's more than one problem here."
2290,8,"Showing its youth through an obvious green character that peers from beneath a cloak of campfire and applewood smoke with banana as the prominent fruit along with secondary apple citrus and a peculiar rubber tire note. The palate is light-bodied and overtly sweet with grass marshmallow and vanilla. Reminiscent of a Lowland malt which only contributes to the disjointed feeling of the whole package."
2291,7,"The nose on this whiskey is like smelling a wet empty barrel; it's all oak char and cinnamon spice. The entry is thin watery and understated with light caramel and cinnamon. In the mid-palate the oak tannins completely take over. It's not just oak spice but the puckeringly dry sour and bitter tannins. This all leads to a bitter bone dry finish. Good whiskey is a conversation between spirit and wood but here the wood is doing all the talking."
2292,7,"Aged for “at least” one month this bourbon is a collaboration with the band Fierce Dead Rabbit. Better Days is pale gold and noticeably cloudy. On the nose it’s paste yeasty bread dough and wet pavement. On the palate it is all over the place with raw oak cinnamon almond and black pepper. There's no balance and no integration. The finish is short hot and dry. As whiskey ages it goes through odd awkward phases and that's where this one is."
2293,11,"There are flavored—cinnamon and coconut—versions at lower proof; this is the “Original” unflavored at full proof. Unaged and clear the aroma is clean and full of roasted corn and a ripple of deep caramel. Surprisingly appealing actually. Tastes like raw new make though: green feinty vegetal and crying out for cola ginger ale even Mountain Dew to help mask it. Are we done with ‘moonshine’ yet? Please?"
2294,7,"Many moonshine products are centered around corn but Freedom Moonshine mixes it up with a mashbill of 95% rye and 5% malted barley. Yeasty rye bread defines the nose with an undercurrent of white grape. The entry is soft with yeasty rye vanilla and bran flakes. There’s some structure in the mid-palate with rye spice and black pepper but it needs more. The finish is a little flat all pointing to the need for a slightly higher proof."
2295,7,"The nose starts with sweet corn cornmeal yeasty bread and black pepper with wet dog and a slight varnishy note right behind. The entry is soft and round with dry cornmeal bran flakes and yeasty bread. Unfortunately the varnish note from the nose returns pretty clearly in the mid-palate along with black pepper. Everything wraps up with a shorter than expected finish. The heart of this whiskey is interesting but it could benefit from a much tighter cut. (distillery store only)"
2296,11,"Clear slight golden hue; as expected from a 7% straight whiskey/93% grain neutral spirit “spirit whiskey.” Faint nose of sweet caramel corn in a hot bloom of estery alcohol. Thickly sweet in the mouth with barely a hint of whiskey like a badly-made cocktail or an ill-conceived flavored vodka. While there are no glaring flaws in the make this is simply a bad idea. Light whiskey failed once in the 1970s and for good reasons. Those reasons haven't changed."
2297,7,"An unaged whiskey from Carroll County Iowa with rye grain and sugar mash. The nose is all kinds of barnyard funk: hay horse and manure. Underneath is a bite of sugar and vanilla. On the palate it’s less funky with sugar strawberry and a grappa-like note. The rye spice emerges mid-palate but it’s fleeting and leads to an edgy and fractured finish. Time in oak might help but there are issues here that wood won’t resolve."
2298,10,"This 3 year old rye receives a 6-month finish in Oro de Oaxaca mezcal casks and has a great fusion of herbal and spice aromas on the nose with a touch of cinnamon almond shells rye bread and a gentle smoky haze. Full of hedonistic pleasures this is sweet but not fruity with cinnamon an intensity of rye spices and more direct mezcal influences and long-lasting flavors."
2299,10,"Named after a 1930s Danish political slogan this is a combination of Stauning’s unpeated malt smoked malt and malted rye whiskies. Give it time to open up and reveal its full beauty: coffee bean plain chocolate chunks a warming twist of sweet peat smoke wood spices apple and fresh breakfast pastries. Green apple flavors rocked by a pandemonium of spices dissipate to sugary caramel vanilla chocolate and malt permeated by mellow smoke."
2300,4,"A star is born. Stauning is a fledgling Danish distillery whose whiskies are 4 years old. Much as I support new world whiskies many of them are works in progress. This is though the most exciting release since Glann ar Mor of France hit the scene. It's very peaty rich fruity and full and it's nearly flawless with few indicators of its youth. This is hard to find but make a note to snap up the third edition. 895 Krone/500 ml"
2301,10,"A dense smoky nose of charcoal ashy soot smoked fish and lobster pots with dunnage floors and hints of dark toffee sweetness make this live up to the promise of its name. Danish peat and floor-malted local barley create a palate of nutty chocolate cocoa blackened wood and pepper with delayed blackberry and cinnamon then it comes full circle back to chocolate leaving a smoky finish."
2302,10,"Gently peated malt was distilled and matured in bourbon and new American oak casks by Claus and Michael Braunstein. A refined nose of smoked duck terrine with fudge gentle vanilla and lime zest underneath. Rather elegant with a note-perfect balance between the smoke and the sweetness. There’s a huge explosion of mandarin Milka chocolate sharp citrus espresso treacle licorice and dry wrinkly dates. The finish of rich black coffee is smooth sultry and long. 795kr"
2303,10,"This vermouth-finished rye whisky is intriguing complex and distinctive with aromas of deep pepper-spice notes of clove and ginger baked orange peel stewed fruits and a gratifying tang of bitter fruit skins and herbal stalks. Mouth-drawing fruitiness with cherry-flavored gummy bears sweet chalky candies strawberry taffy and a piercing streak of spice followed by cinnamon and the return of bitter herbs. Drink it neat or enliven your Boulevardier game."
2304,10,"Distilled predominantly from floor-malted locally grown rye the first impression is one of spiciness with peppercorn clove cardamom dark rye bread dried apple rings cinnamon bark and pear. It’s like a country kitchen in the fall. The taste is initially light and creamy like malted milk though the body fattens up with red apple cranberry clove and pepper ending with Bramley apples and a pleasant spiciness."
2305,10,"Brothers Claus and Michael Braunstein conceived the notion of making Danish whisky during fly-fishing trips to Scotland. Distilled on their combined column and pot still set this peated whisky was disgorged from bourbon casks filled in 2007. Lime and Parma violets on the nose balance antiseptic and tea tree oil. Fizzy sherbet candy lime banana and pineapple in the mouth ending with a dry finish of Edinburgh rock. Fans of Islay’s south coast whiskies should try this one. 5000kr"
2306,10,"Part of Stauning’s Research Series this clear unaged spirit is made from a mashbill of 70% malted rye and 30% malted barley. Fragrant aromatic spices with ground ginger fine pepper woodsmoke and lavender soap—as an olfactory experience it has its limitations. Fruity and light with early smokiness it has bold fruit flavors spice and clementine fading to orchard fruits. Substitute in your mezcal cocktails and run wild."
2307,10,"This is big bruising beautiful whisky. It even feels thick when you pour it. The dark tawny liquid evokes mixed peel rum and raisin from the maturation in oloroso sherry casks. Tipping in a mouthful unleashes a slick of dark bramble and black currant flavors over the tongue; chewy and weighty with thick tannins it develops with burnished oak fig gingerbread and dark spices achieving a bitter riposte before it finally pitches over the back of the throat into oblivion. 795kr"
2308,4,"Denmark often seems to live in the shadow of Sweden and certainly that has been the case with whisky. But slowly and surely a revolution is happening there and I suspect that Stauning will be right at the forefront of it. This is another work in progress: pleasant well made and potentially very good indeed. The dominant flavors are gooseberry sour apple and pepper. Good as an aperitif. 695 Krone/500 ml"
2309,10,"This 3 year old whisky comes from Denmark’s smallest distillery where Jens-Erik Jørgensen has invested in a bulbous pot still from Forsyths Scotland. I found barley sugar mashing malt risen loaves vanilla and fruity esters reminiscent of boiled sweets. The warming flavors begin with orange candies and clove but it bucks like a wild stallion before settling to divulge a hint of licorice and cayenne pepper. A dry and sudden finish. Promising but needs time to mellow. €200"
2310,4,"It's the sheer chutzpah of these young whisky producers that I adore. They don't care. They're skate punks crashing through the whisky suburbs flipping cartwheels and turning the world upside down. This isn't great truth be told but what nerve to try making a rye! And while it's hard to tell with this most difficult of grains I reckon this will come off. Hickory licorice and spice are in place. Now we need balance. Watch this space. 495 Krone/500 ml"
2311,10,"The Braunstein craft distillery and brewery lies southwest of Copenhagen at Køge Harbor. This one uses barley peated to a phenolic content of 60 ppm and boy do you know it! Any balance of character is resoundingly bested by acrid aromas of charcoal sticks sooty fireplaces and blackened toast. The oily mouthfeel oozes cherry soda bubblegum maraschino Ama’r Stang and Band-Aids with chicory on the finish. This needs better balance; at present it’s like a pyroclastic cloud erupting from the glass. 795kr"
2312,4,"From the distillery that received last year’s World Whisky award comes another contender for the title in 2013. This is called 100 because it’s 100 percent rye distilled in pot stills 100 proof and 100 months old (a bit over eight years). It’s big and perfectly balanced between honey and fruit sparkling distinctive raunchy spice and a dash of ginger biscuits. This is rye to die for. Superb. €53"
2313,4,"Millstone is made by Zuidam a Dutch spirits and liquor company that prides itself on never cutting corners and in using the very finest ingredients. There are hundreds of European distilleries making spirit but few this good. Its malt and rye whiskies have always been special but this is Premier League a world class sherried 12 year old that matches many sherried Scotch whiskies flavor to flavor. That's a first for Europe. €60"
2314,10,"The IMAX of rye. Zuidam Distillers seem to have intensified every aspect of this small batch 100% rye. The plum is fresher juicier even the spices more assertive. There’s more creaminess fruit skin piquancy slabs of chocolate allspice ground cinnamon and a greater rye character by far. This thumps the tongue hard delivering quite an experience. In submission with gums zinging the unrepentant finish goes on forever."
2315,10,"Very fragrant with notes of fresh ripe plum crisp spice herbs caramel treacle black pepper and hints of dark chocolate. Leave the glass alone and the spices really hit their stride. The flavor shifts imperceptibly covering citrus vanilla chocolate and ripe orchard fruits generating a slow build-up of spices like a gathering storm: your taste buds have nowhere left to run. Beautifully paced."
2316,4,"This is from Dutch distiller Zuidam and it's the third exceptional bottling in a row. The PX here refers to the Pedro Ximenez cask used in maturation and this is almost liqueur-like with plummy fruits gooseberry damson jam and overripe plum. But there's lots going on here on top with a dusting of cocoa some perfumey notes and a sniff of pepper. The jam keeps fighting back though and there's apricot in there at the end. €75"
2317,1,"Based in the village of Baarle-Nassau in the Netherlands the Zuidam distillery was built by genever distiller Fred Van Zuidam in 2002 and is now run by his son Patrick who started distilling at the age of 14. His single malt is made from windmill-ground barley given temperature-controlled fermentation distilled in Holstein stills and aged in new oak for a period before being racked into older casks. A rich amber color this expression is ripe and fruity with plenty of red cherry a little hint of fig and a little sweet spice. Balanced and rich with a fresh citric farewell this is a classy arrival on the world scene. £59"
2318,1,"Patrick van Zuidam uses rye as part of his genever but when a farmer phoned up saying he had a surplus he figured he might as well try a 100% rye whisky. Of similarly deep hue to the 8 year old but a little more ruddy this has a more waxy aroma but with fresh rye sourdough penetrating. The spiciness which typifies rye here has a North African edge: cumin cinnamon coriander seed. The palate is less explosive and dusty than American examples; this is more of a slow-burning fuse that passes through orange and smooth sweet oak before the spices return. £46"
2319,10,"Originating from Zuidam Distillers’ diverse inventory of casks this single malt whisky conjures thoughts of bread dough white grape and slightly sour spices. The orange flavors start as a deep glow then blossom beautifully into rich marmalade aromas. Initially mouth-drawing with bold juicy flavors of peach and orange supported by toffee and a gentle lift of spices. Appetizing taste of spiced orange cake to finish. (637 bottles)"
2320,4,"Van Zuidam distillery’s star has risen rapidly — it’s under ten years old —and its single malt and rye are confident forays into the world of whisky. So is this. This is 5 ½ years old and is a distinctly different take on peat with little acerbity oil smoke or charcoal. A softer spiciness is present — it’s an almost ginger cake quality with menthol and lemon-lime candy in the mix. €55 (Not available in the U.S.)"
2321,10,"Hard toffee Brazil nut milk chocolate and noticeable rye bread aromas on the nose from this new American oak barrel. The rye spiciness is embedded with the other flavors; balanced but not dominant. Soft and fudgey flavors display sparkling spices deeper toffee notes vanilla and cinnamon bark. Try a dash of water to unlock the sweetness and citrus elements below the surface. If anything this accentuates the tobacco and spiciness of the finish (The Whisky Exchange only) £85"
2322,10,"Dark and mysterious with prune juice leather boots aniseed Brazil nut and tobacco. There’s oloroso and PX influence on the palate with prune dried fig baked orange dark muscovado chocolate-covered toffee and hazelnut with a finish of cocoa and smoky espresso notes. It nearly has the body and texture to sustain these heavy-duty flavors but it’s a bit like a skinny kid in a leather jacket trying to act tough. £48"
2323,10,"Mandarin breakfast pastries lemon meringue pie warm peach sweet grapefruit halves and a fine layer of spices on the nose make for an appealing introduction. Baked orange sweet fudge and pepper on first sip with later development of grilled pineapple vanilla and dried mango. With its instantly likeable flavors this is a great recruiting whisky for new drinkers though the palate development has its limitations. £48"
2324,10,"Tawny and ruby port casks have robed this whisky in fantastic colors and on the nose there are baked cherries blueberry muffin sloes caramel and mild spice notes to enjoy. The palate swirls with sweet caramel cola candy bitter orange plum damson and peppercorn before hitting its stride with creamy vanilla toffee baked apple and fruit syrup flavors and ending with a satisfying return of spice on the finish.£48"
2325,10,"Orange segments and grapefruit peel with a spritz of peel oils accompanied by gentle spice bakery notes and fruit-flavored jelly candies. Vanilla sweet orange honey grapefruit peel peppery spice and lavender then baked orange with deeper honey tones. Their first bottling called The One in 2014 was poor: this isn’t. Master blender Dhavall Gandhi joined the distillery in 2016 and he has turned this into a terrific dram.£39"
2326,4,"Lakes distillery will become the fifth English whisky producer when it starts distilling this year. That puts England on the whisky map. Before then though this is its first bottling: a blend of British whiskies though I'm not sure what that means exactly. The nose is fine but on the palate it's like skiing on end-of-season snow: you get to ski but it's a thin wet and not totally comfortable ride. England expects…better. £30"
2327,4,"This contains hops and isn't matured for at least 3 years so in Europe it can't be classed as whisky but it's positive proof that some of the experimentation so widespread among American craft distillers is finding its way to Europe. This might be flabby and sappy but it's sweet and utterly charming and there is ginger menthol and glacé cherry in the mix. But most of all there's tinned pear and I LOVE tinned pear. Excellently made too. My new guilty pleasure. £33"
2328,10,"St. George’s Distillery master distiller David Fitt makes scrumptious grain whiskies as well as The English whiskies and this one has a beautiful balance of malt and spiciness with crisp barley notes cornbread rye spice peppercorn light honey green fruits and some classic grain characteristics. Zested orange lime toasted cereal caramel and lovely rye notes on show though the spiciness is a little tame. (1962 bottles) £48"
2329,4,"This is one of the first two releases from Copper House a distillery contained within the Adnams brewery at Southwold on the east coast of England. If you know Adnams’ beers it will come as no surprise that it's breaking new ground by creating a whisky with a mashbill of wheat oats and barley. This is only 3 years old but a soft toffee creaminess chocolate orange oak and pepper ensure a delightful and surprisingly full whisky. £44"
2330,11,"Hugely different from the standard Drambuie: much more dryly herbal and the whisky's right here in the nose...and yet they are distinctly related in the base character of the herbs. The whisky is quite present — 15 year old Speyside malts shine like the sun on rippling water — but the flavors of Drambuie are clear as well. Still sweet but the whisky is much more the star. A Drambuie for us?"
2331,7,"Compass Box takes a fresh approach to flavored whisky by infusing Navalino oranges and spices into a blend of Highland single malt and single grain whisky. Bright and slightly bitter orange peel combines with vanilla honey and malt. The grain whisky gives nice support and structure along with black pepper cinnamon and clove spice. Great balance between the whisky and flavoring in a flavored whisky that is much more dry than sweet. Finally a flavored whisky to get really excited about."
2332,11,"Intriguing herbal/medicinal nose with notes of pepper grass dried hay dried flowers orange peel and licorice. Sweet but lively and light on the palate as the orange explodes and the whisky boldly appears wrapped in honey and herbs. The finish is herbal and sweet as the whisky strolls off into the distance. Overall quite complex and rewarding."
2333,10,"A limited-edition cold-brew coffee infusion of roasted Arabica beans this might be the most moreish drink I’ve had all year. Dark ruby in color with a nutty velvety coffee bean aroma and dark fruits. While Jameson fruitiness is evident floral notes are harder to detect. Smooth and creamy across the tongue with blocks of cacao praline and dark toffee it still finds a classic pot still spiciness to finish."
2334,11,"Tons of vanilla and sweet custard in the nose enough to make the mouth water and not fake-smelling at all. Once again the 40% makes a difference: light and sweet in the mouth like a glass of creme brulee eau de vie! I'd enjoyed the sweet vanilla-spice character so much that the whisky slipping in at the end was almost a shock but it's there and even adds a bit of mint and fire. Embarrassingly tasty."
2335,11,"Booze candy from Beam? More like bacon in a glass: the sweet smokiness invaded my dining room (definitely the last tasting of the day). Richly smoky-sweet with a clear balance of maple over corn; like a rustic breakfast of bacon pancakes and whiskey! The maple’s restrained and authentic the 45% keeps it from being too sweet and there’s plenty of good bourbon flavor here especially at the finish. Lush tasty; if you have to do flavors here’s how."
2336,10,"Kerrygold is Ireland’s major player in the dairy business. Scored against other Irish cream liqueurs this is highly rated. I’m smitten. The sweet chocolate is rich delectable and utterly gorgeous with melting caramels slathered all over the taste buds riding high on a wave of lush Irish cream. There are fruity notes of sultana and black cherry expressed by the chocolate which soar above the reliable foundation of Irish whiskey. Can you tell this won my heart? Do indulge."
2337,11,"Finger Lakes Distilling rye whiskey infused with Catskill Mountains honey. The nose is grassy oily rye whiskey and the honey’s there mostly as a rounder richer character enhancer. It’s much more present in the mouth merging very nicely indeed with the rye. There’s authentic delicious honey flavor here and it’s balanced beautifully as the rye keeps it from being sticky or oversweet. An excellent and interesting flavored whiskey; up there with the best examples of the category."
2338,3,"A rye-fueled horse-drawn sleigh ride to a backwoods Quebec sugar shack springs instantly to mind. Vanilla toasted wood brittle maple snow taffy and the woody crystalline granularity of maple sugar in a velvety smooth whisky base. Hot pepper wood smoke and green maple bark fold into a steaming cauldron of whisky barrel notes. The first few days’ maple syrup is the richest and that alone is what blender Michel Marcil uses for this ultra-premium maple whisky. (Quebec only (dang!)) C$50"
2339,7,"Ginger may not be the first flavor that leaps to mind when you think flavored whiskey but then you realize how common the combination is: Jack and Ginger Jameson and Ginger and now Virgil Kaine. Fresh ginger is unmistakable on the nose and the secret to this whiskey’s success. On the palate fresh ginger seamlessly integrates with oak black pepper and clove spice. Underneath is sweet vanilla that helps keep everything in balance. A well-executed and savvy flavored whiskey."
2340,11,"With a rich nose like warm maple syrup it’s hard to miss that this is a flavored whisky. But the maple smells real like breakfast in a Vermont diner. It’s also good that it’s not sickly sweet and thick; the mouthfeel is like good Crown with maple flavor not a big wad of syrup. So if you like flavored whiskies bring on the Canadian cocktails and ice cream: this is the good stuff."
2341,12,"FEW proofed its straight rye with oolong tea for this unusual whiskey specialty and while the effect is subtle it’s unmistakable. Dusty cloves and old cigar box oolong tea leaves bundled herbs polished furniture and a hint of blueberries and Concord grapes on the nose. The palate is dry and nutty austere and spare: cocoa powder herbal oak licorice tea mint raw walnuts and pecans. More walnuts mint licorice dry oak and black pepper on the finish."
2342,12,"Not a whiskey: FEW Spirits cut its bourbon with cold-brew coffee instead of water but the effect is subtle and surprising. There’s sweet green tea spearmint gum marzipan coconut caraway and toasted oak on the nose. Mint-chocolate candy licorice blueberry and black pepper vie with oak on the palate; adding water a juicy fruity strain of raspberry and pomegranate emerges. The finish is dry peppery and herbal; water brings out fruit to balance."
2343,11,"Insistent honey nose with whisky underneath; the honey is very forward but still floral and light fresh. Flavor is pleasant: floral faintly herbal and more honey but again light and fresh not cloying not heavy. There’s a hint of citrus in the finish and then finally there is a slightly sticky character. Not something a single malt drinker would likely reach for but a respectable entry in the field of flavored whisky."
2344,12,"Most flavored whiskeys rely on lab-made additives but not this one: Its unique characteristics come from castoreum an oil found in sacs located beneath beavers’ tails as well as botanicals including birch oil raspberry and Canadian snakeroot. The effect is outlandish but it's got panache with potpourri pine sage cinnamon orange peel and bubble gum aromas. Flavors run to piney sweet and spicy: sage eucalyptus grape Kool-Aid cinnamon Red Hots. It finishes with Christmas pine and spice as well as berries chocolate and tea leaves. Unconventional and certainly not for everyone but if you keep an open mind you might just be surprised. Price per 200 ml"
2345,7,"Most flavored whiskeys start with an existing whiskey and add flavoring but Bushel & Barrel comes at it from the other end mixing Berentzen’s apple liqueur with a Kentucky bourbon. Bright crisp apple cider defines the opening while in the mid-palate subtle bourbon notes emerge with vanilla honey cinnamon and light oak. The bourbon notes complement the sweet apple cider and help keep things from getting too sweet. Bourbon and cider have always been buddies and they do quite well together here."
2346,11,"Chopped vanilla beans were added to barrels of Bowman bourbon (in varying amounts); the barrels were married after 24 months and bottled. The nose has soft vanilla and sweet orange; it's almost soothing balm-like. Vanilla is not at all overpowering in the mouth but shows more as a richness around the edges. Otherwise a good sprightly bourbon with a nice citrus and oak finish; like to try this in a cocktail."
2347,3,"A judicious infusion of vanilla and spice bolsters cinnamon pepper caramel and aged oak while leaving the rye whisky character intact. Prune juice tinged with citrus fruit balances sour black licorice and earthy artist’s canvas. The palate has a creaminess but with pithy silky tannins. Burning hot cinnamon hearts and syrupy sweetness take us vaguely into liqueur territory. A complex nose but a simple palate that soon fades into white grapefruit and a warming peppery glow. (Canada only) C$26"
2348,11,"Appropriately caramel-colored. The smell of caramel and taffy pushes out of the glass but as you get closer there’s the fresh green snap of clear corn whiskey laced through it like fruit in your dessert (with an authoritative boozy crack to it). Nothing’s overpowering on the palate — a swirling balanced ride of sweet candy fresh corn and estery booze — but the finish sings a clear pure note of…salted caramel. This could teach flavored vodkas a thing or two."
2349,3,"According to the maple syrup geeks who make Sortilège Quebec’s sugar maple forests produce their sweetest woodiest most robust flavors in the early days of the late-winter syrup season. This maple whisky is proof positive. Creamy sweet slightly peppery leafy in a good way and richly imbued with woodsy maple Sortilège stays firmly in the whisky camp though just downwind from the sugar shack. Like maple syrup itself it leaves the palate slowly. Price is per 375 ml."
2350,11,"The aroma is rich with pumpkin pie notes and a strong citrus component. There’s eight tons of actual pumpkin in the year’s run of this seasonal; impressive and you can smell the roasted gourd. The whiskey’s not sickly sweet as feared but more like a homemade sugarless pumpkin pie almost savory. The flavor is solid rich and integrates well. For what it is it’s done well and it’s done boldly. I’d maybe back off the orange a bit."
2351,7,"True to its name the nose is exactly Red Hots candy along with a touch of corn underneath. The entry is soft cinnamon but it quickly ramps up to fiery Red Hots candy. The proofing here matches the flavor precisely for a pleasantly spicy but not overly fiery mid-palate. The finish is short and cleans up well with light lingering cinnamon left behind. A good balance of sweet and spicy and a solid offering for the genre."
2352,11,"Malt whiskey and honey flip back and forth in the nose; so precisely balanced my nose doesn’t seem to know what to make of it. Light and a bit frisky in the mouth and the honey is more a grace note than a strong presence though it does come in more in the finish. Not overly sweet not heavy but it’s hard to see the honey as a real game-changer."
2353,11,"Quite a bit darker than most other whisky creams. Chocolate and caramel—on the burnt side an interesting difference—in the nose with a sly hint of whisky behind it. Sweet and creamy a bit clingy with just a sting of whisky.  Somewhat generic though because that interesting dark caramel is in the nose only and I’d like this to be a bit more distinctive; more Forty Creek. Still pleasant enough for booze candy! C$29"
2354,11,"Nose is full of a wonderful authentic maple syrup smell with a warming background of whisky. The maple’s there in the mouth too; not overwhelming and blending well with the whisky. There’s a good balance here for what it is and the finish is clean. If you like maple this is going to do it: it’s not cloying or thick and could make a great cocktail with — really — bacon."
2355,7,"More widely available than Buffalo Trace’s adored Bourbon Cream Prichard’s takes premium cream from Wisconsin and adds it to their Sweet Lucy liqueur. The nose is sweet but not overly so with orange creamsicle and just a hint of whiskey with oak spice. On the palate it’s creamy confection bliss with ladyfingers covered in heavy cream and candied orange topped with a drizzle of bourbon. Rich creamy but not too heavy; file this one as a dangerously delicious guilty pleasure."
2356,11,"Smells like sweet dead-ripe cherries mashed up in bourbon with some brown sugar and just a dust of cinnamon. It's sweet a bit thick but 80 proof warming and the bourbon — the Beam cinnamon note comes out clearer now — is dominant over the cherries here. The finish sees more cinnamon even a hint of barrel oak and manages to dry out a bit."
2357,7,"Located in the heart of Vermont’s syrup belt Saxtons River distillery makes both a Vermont maple-flavored rye and a maple-flavored bourbon whiskey. The rye is the better of the two and does a solid job of mixing oak cinnamon black pepper and rye spice notes with vanilla and rich maple syrup. The rye whiskey is a little young but the maple syrup complements it well and is more companion than cover."
2358,11,"Spice nose but some alcohol notes put a hot twist to it. A blast of baking spices — nutmeg anise allspice mace — hits the palate along with shots of citrus and vanilla that take a while to get organized and settled down leading to a sweet finish where the orange dominates. If Spicebox is a fireside drink this is a snowy woods outdoors drink; a bit hotter more rustic more rough."
2359,11,"Canadian whisky is sweeter to start with and so may well be a natural base for flavors. It certainly seems that way with this underpriced example. The nose is like restrained caramel candy a fairly deep note of toasted sugar. The drink itself is sweet but doesn’t cling and is crying for a bit of fizz or some ice cream to drape itself over. Not bad at all for the price."
2360,7,"Following in the footsteps of Bushmills Irish Honey Castle Brands tries their hand at a light and sweet Irish whiskey-based liqueur. Strong clover honey dominates with caramel vanilla bean cinnamon and a little ginger spice. Hard to get to the base whiskey through all the sweet notes but that seems to be the point. Just short of cloying this is a whiskey-based liqueur for those more interested in the liqueur than the whiskey."
2361,7,"William Grant’s answer to Drambuie is a much less sweet and higher proof Irish whiskey-based liqueur. Monster caramel leaps out of the glass with an undercurrent of cola. Caramel leads to chocolate on the palate before malt and grain whiskey undertones emerge. Mid-palate is a little hot but it helps cut through the underlying sweetness and also features some botanicals like juniper and black pepper. Clearly a mixing spirit and probably best thrown into a cola or ginger ale."
2362,7,"Of all the flavors you’d expect to see in the moonshine space coconut is probably the last. Stillhouse’s Coconut Moonshine has a coconut cream nose with a touch of milk chocolate that’s actually inviting. On the palate it’s creamy chocolatey coconut with just a hint of corn whiskey. The mid-palate lacks some structure with only a touch of spice. The finish is also a little muted but damn if they didn’t make a coconut moonshine that isn’t horrid."
2363,11,"Rye whiskey aged in casks used to age maple syrup. As penetrating an aroma as maple is it’s very subtle here. The nose is rye whiskey—spicy oily bitter/minty—with just the barest hint of maple. The maple peeps up mid-palate for a sweet turn and lingers into the finish. I need to be convinced of the attraction; the maple and rye jar a bit when jammed together. And the price—$82 for 750 ml—seems crazy. Price is per 375 ml."
2364,3,"Burnt caramel sweet—almost candied—but not cloying the whisky quickly develops fiery blasts of pepper that linger long on the sides of your tongue. As the heat builds caramel melts into barley sugar which in turn fades into bitter citrus pith. Flinty hard rye and vague barrel tones never let us forget that this is whisky: whisky enhanced with vanilla and spices that a probing palate might have found anyway in the unflavored dram."
2365,11,"A sweet mélange of bourbon honey ladyfingers and praline in the nose with a faint thread of heavy tree blossoms. Quite sweet but not syrupy and the aromas — minus the blossoms — are here plus vanilla. Some stickiness on the finish but it’s not unpleasant more like candy which is what this experience is like: booze candy. That candy simplicity is confusing: there are a lot of flavors here but at a candy level. A bit less sweetness would be welcome."
2366,3,"Pink cotton candy and hot caramel sauce on a simple nose turn to rich burnt toffee and invigorating hot chili pepper on the palate followed by savory herbs. The herbal tones quickly turn pleasantly bitter before fading into the barest suggestion of dry oak. Tingling peppery heat lingers right to the end. A hot spicy version of Wiser’s Deluxe with the rye elements boosted by added vanilla. (Canada only) C$28"
2367,11,"Canadian Mist with flavor and sweetener. Boozy but fresh peach vanilla and sugar nose; smells like a fresh juicy peach cobbler; where's the whisky? Very much dessert-like in the mouth sweet full but not cloying; points for that. Finish is peach candies vanilla and finally some whisky notes. Even at 35% I'd like a lot more whisky character here; otherwise what's the point? Still head and shoulders above Southern Comfort's flavor experiments."
2368,11,"Black bottle cocked-fist logo. Sourced whiskey infused with “green tea hibiscus eucalyptus fennel gingko and more.” Smells schnapps-ish bright floral and woodsy notes with a medicinal twang. Quite sweet but not sticky; the herbs keep it perky. The whiskey is tamped down by the sweet and infusion; the finish gets even more medicinal. I’d like less sweet and more whiskey. Not sure who the market is for this but it makes a tasty add to tea."
2369,7,"Even though it has more alcohol than Southern Shine’s straight ‘moonshine’ the nose is fairly evasive with subtle cinnamon apple. The entry is much sweeter than expected with caramel cinnamon and apple but manages to be well-balanced by the base spirit which adds pepper spice and enhances the cinnamon. The apple notes flirt with artificiality but end up reading as dried apple. The finish is long and maintains the cinnamon-apple spice well but is a tad hot."
2370,3,"A subtle essence of vanilla and restrained crispy oak are lathered in rich butterscotch then seasoned with scorching pepper and a pinch of rye spices. Surprisingly it’s not overly sweet. Smooth creamy custard coats your mouth mellowing otherwise assertive spices. The dram finishes in pulling citrus pith with touches of peppery heat tingling ginger and cloves and fading hints of ripe cherries. Faint but distinct whiffs of barrels remind us that this colorless liquid is whisky. (Alberta only) C$40"
2371,7,"Prichard’s Double Barreled Bourbon is flavored with artisan chocolate. This dark chocolate is clear on the nose but not singular as it's accompanied by strong oak maple syrup and cherry. On the palate chocolate becomes more a supporting flavor for classic bourbon notes of oak maple caramel and clove spice. The mid-palate is a little acidic and the chocolate adds a slight bitterness to the equation. The finish is a little too dry but in all an intriguing combination of flavors."
2372,11,"An odd roaring noseful of spices: vanilla pepper ginger teaberry. Tastes perfumey first then resolves to sweet vanilla hot oak and more teaberry. Can’t decide if it wants to be bourbon—it’s hot and flexing oak—or candy and does a poor job at both; it’s like a linebacker in a French maid’s outfit just wrong. There are much better sweet spicy whiskey mixes out there; the original Spicebox comes to mind."
2373,11,"Root beer (wintergreen sugar a bit of cinnamon) and oak on the nose; whiskey/oak predominates. There’s actually a lot of whiskey flavor here too though it’s not great whiskey the finish gets sweet and clingy and the mix seems forced. Still…root beer-flavored whiskey? In an aluminum bottle? Why not just buy some whiskey and put it in your root beer? Then when you come to your senses you can drink the whiskey like a civilized human."
2374,3,"Sweet heavy vanilla powdered sugar and dog-toothed spring violets it smells very light with soft hints of sweet floral perfume. What begins as viscous and creamy on the tongue suddenly becomes refreshingly bitter and loaded with hot singeing spices. Pepper and dried candied orange peel linger while the sweetness dims. A pleasing bitter finish fades into a warm glow. Although the whisky struggles at first it breaks through in the middle with its spices and heat. (Canada only) C$31"
2375,5,"This literally tastes like pan-fried mushrooms and roots. It’s earthy; you don’t really expect such intensity from a flavored whiskey. After earth hops chocolate and root beer I finally taste the whiskey; a nearly absent sensation toward the end. But I guess that’s the point: if they wanted you to taste whiskey they wouldn’t flavor it. Still there are no chemically-imbalanced flavors here. This is worth trying even for us curmudgeon purists."
2376,11,"Lemony pine woods even some seashore aromas over the sweetness of the malt whiskey underneath. Not overly bitter more whiskey-sweet and the aromas are subdued in the mouth. I like a big hoppy IPA but this isn’t setting my palate. I think it’s missing the body of a beer. I have yet to have a hopped whiskey that I really like; this isn’t it either."
2377,11,"A medicinal cherry smell like cough syrup and cherry PEZ edged with a nutty hint of almonds. Medium-bodied; a slow-flow on the tongue. The cherry doesn’t taste real (like Red Stag’s does) and the SoCo sweetness doesn’t help that. There is a pickup at the end as the spirit seems to evaporate off the tongue. I can’t help thinking that this should have been a slam-dunk…but they missed."
2378,11,"The first thing out of the glass is bourbon — 80 proof bottlings will do that — followed by a secondary note of strong-brewed tea with a dollop of honey. It's quite sweet and hot and the tea largely disappears except as a frill around the edges. This is more a honey drink than a tea drink and there are better honey drinks out there."
2379,11,"It certainly is cinnamon: got a nose full of it and not Red Hots either this is real cinnamon just missing the depth of Vietnamese and with yes a bit of whisky there. There's next to no whisky in the mouth though; this is like a cup of sweet cinnamon tea something I'd add whisky to. Too sweet too cinnamon. Where's the whisky?"
2380,11,"Warm maple caramel and salt in the nose like caramels being melted for making cookies (something my wife does every Christmas). Thin boozy maple in the mouth. Disappointing though I suppose it would be good in desserts or on desserts. But I really expect more whisky even in a flavored whisky under 40%."
2381,11,"Faint spice aroma becomes more apparent after sitting for 20 minutes; initial pour smelled much like the Reserve Cherry (see below). Christmas cookie spices. Thick and sweet spice is more evident. Not bad but pretty thick and not much bourbon flavor for 45%."
2382,11,"Given the Beam house character of cinnamon I thought this was redundant till I got a whiff of the sweet cinnamon coming off this like a tea made from Red Hots candies. The drink itself is thickly sweet and more of the hot cinnamon candy overwhelms anything else; the bourbon is largely lost here. If anything the finish is even more heavy-handed."
2383,11,"Based on the Hayes Parker bourbon. Faint cherry aroma; not sure I’d pick it out without the label’s help. Quite sweet but still; the cherry character is not so much subtle or faint as just not there. There is some sweet cherry candy character at the very end. Disappointing."
2384,3,"Cinnamon hearts. Very sweet and crazy hot with cinnamon. The cinnamon so dominates this liqueur-like drink that very little whisky manages to peek through until the very end of a long murderously hot finish. Even then cinnamon overrides the whiskyness leaving a drink rather than a dram. Fun yes great fun and almost certainly a bracing shooter but it may be difficult to convince the whisky aficionado to think of this as whisky."
2385,3,"Cinnamon is reputed to have medicinal qualities but you can bet those who drink Catch Fire Cinnamon do so for the incinerating jolt of sweet spicy heat. Cinnamon hearts and hints of grain dust almost like those cinnamon sticks in Christmas punch. Sweet but not cloying. A creamy mouthfeel and touch of whisky wood remind us if vaguely that Catch Fire is whisky. The Lynne Truss of flavored whiskies: shoots winces and leaves with a long glowing finish."
2386,3,"When they say berry they mean berries: baskets of blueberries blackberries and raspberries until suddenly the palate veers off into grape popsicles. This is one sweet unabashedly faux-fruity potation but other than traces of oak not much whisky flavor remains. Still in the right hands it could be a lot of cocktail fun. Rather than serving it in a whisky glass a dram or two on French vanilla or coconut-milk ice cream is genuinely scrumptious."
2387,3,"Early trial batches of this whisky flavored by cold infusion tasted like sweet roasted squash. However the final version that we have here is as inviting as the nutmeg-laced pumpkin pie it so resembles. Sweet vanilla and salt water taffy fill the air with rummy Christmas eggnog taking up the rear. Unusual in that it’s sweet but not syrupy. Hot pepper lingers as do sweet tingling spices but the whisky notes just barely show their presence. (Canada only) C$22"
2388,11,"Artificial cherry aroma like cherry PEZ and barely a hint of bourbon. The taste is not overpoweringly sweet at all a surprise and there's a nutty almost Luxardo-like character in the cherry that would be more interesting if it weren't for the soapy notes and bitter medicinal flavor of the whiskey. A more natural cherry character would net a higher rating."
2389,3,"One of the most popular flavored whiskies today is Fireball cinnamon so it’s no surprise that other cinnamon whiskies are entering the market. This one has a lovely woody cinnamon nose that bursts into sweet blistering cinnamon on the palate. Cinnamon is a natural whisky flavor but here rather than complement the underlying whisky it completely masks it. This is a cinnamon liqueur and a good one. A fun shooter perhaps but it’s barely whisky."
2390,7,"Spiced apple cider on the nose is a little more spice than cider with strong cinnamon nutmeg and allspice. Baked apple is there on the opening but it doesn’t take long for the spices to take over especially the cinnamon which dominates. The cinnamon here leans more toward Red Hots than cinnamon stick and by the time we get to the finish it has completely conquered this spirit. May have been better labeled Spicy Cinnamon Apple Pie Moonshine."
2391,3,"Real maple syrup has an earthy woodsy aroma; maple flavoring has strong overtones of coconut and so does Cabin Fever. The nose evokes dried sweetened baking coconut while the sweet and spicy palate is a hot liquid coconut macaroon. Peppery notes suggest that it’s whisky but without any traces of barrel aging that’s as close as you get. Best part? The long spicy finish with its confection-sweet coconut."
2392,7,"All of the elements that work with Southern Shine’s Apple Pie bottling don’t work with their Blueberry. An extremely evasive nose leads to an artificially-flavored palate. Here the blueberry tastes more like flavored bubblegum than fruit. The white pepper from the base spirit clashes with the berry like a multi-car pileup. The finish is hot too dry and a little sour. There’s just nothing about this that’s pleasant or enjoyable."
2393,7,"The aromas from the base rye moonshine complement the apple much better here than in Freedom’s other flavored offerings. Baked apple mixes with cinnamon and is supported by a bread undertone. The apple note comes off as just a little too artificial. Like the other Freedom Moonshine products the entry is too soft and flat. The biggest problem here clearly is the proof. There’s just not enough structure to do anything with this moonshine: mix ice or otherwise enjoy."
2394,11,"Does a nose of bright bubble gum and fresh-cut peppers touched by the fermented heat of Tabasco sound good? It comes bursting out of the glass with this one busy and hot. The taste hits first with the bubble gum blast sweet and light even quickly pleasant until the pepper breaks in twisting and warping this liqueur with a whirl of sweet hot bitter vegetal flavors that turns to a sticky-sweet heat in the finish.   A regrettably bad idea."
2395,7,"This flavored moonshine smells like a mass of wet used tea bags. Underneath is some faint lemon honey and black pepper but it’s hard to get to it through the tea. Entry is strong oversteeped tea which only gets stronger more tannic and more bitter in the mid-palate. Syrupy lemon honey tries and fails to balance this oversteeped mess. Finish is long bitter slightly hot and unpleasant. Do not attempt to drink without copious amounts of crushed ice."
2396,10,"This is one of those whiskies where one sip will convert you to its delights. Fruit salad with fresh apple and lime fruit-flavored hard candy roasted aromatic spices salted potato skins and digestive biscuits. A moreish palate of salted caramel musty chocolate sweet fruits viennoiseries creamy caramels malt and gentle spices which peaks during the finish leaving baked apple flavors and late sherry notes. Don’t pass this up."
2397,10,"Distillerie Castan lies northeast of Toulouse and makes this peated whisky disgorged from a white wine cask. The nose has pear apple pie and vanilla and it’s quite intensely spicy with cinnamon pepper and eucalyptus. A superb flavor trajectory beginning with sweet lemon bonbons baked apple cinnamon and pepper then baked orange desserts ending on a hint of smoke. Lime zest spices and mild smoke to finish. (1000 bottles)"
2398,4,"Glann ar Mor is a rising star in the world of whisky one of three very impressive distilleries in the Brittany region in Northern France and this new single malt fresh from the cask at the back end of September is its finest release yet. A mixture of soft tinned fruits especially sweet pears in syrup sweet vanilla ice cream and a delicate but assertive earthy underbed make this an utter delight. Magnifique. €57"
2399,12,"Explore the layers of this malted rye. It is herbaceous and minerally throughout with aromas of licorice chamomile ginger tarragon incense cooked pears bread dough cinnamon and soil. The flavors express grain minerals and earth—tarragon licorice peppercorn roasted peaches walnut shells and assertive but not overpowering oak. This young whisky’s flavors are from the field fermenter and still not the barrel. Unique complex and exciting. (450 bottles)"
2400,10,"Heavily peated to 50 ppm the nose greets you with lemon sponge cake maritime notes smoked bacon rind and aromatic smoke opening up blue-gray peat-fire smoke light toffee fire-blackened driftwood clove and peppercorn. Silky soft with lemon vanilla fresh apple and honey plus pepper ground over caramel and peach. The palate runs clean and pure: Picture a peat lover behind the wheel of an electric car."
2401,10,"The subtle sweet smoke like singed rocks around a beach fire becomes more pungent if left unattended. Underneath aromas of sweet lemons tropical fruits lemongrass and smoked olives abound. Juicy sweetness with a real concentration of mango papaya and sugary boiled candies melds into flavors of vanilla and Battenberg cake. After a concluding rush of pepper the smoky fumes permeate through the back end. Oh boy! Ridiculously good! €115"
2402,10,"Although G. Rozelieures makes several peated whiskies this is an unpeated single malt with notes of honey sherbet summer flowers ears of barley buttery biscuits and black peppercorn. Matured in French oak bourbon and cognac casks; the balance is superb with honey icing sugar vanilla apple Danish and spicy oak leading to caramel and baked apple in custard. The substantial mouthfeel and serene transition of flavors make this heavenly to drink."
2403,10,"Distilling has been in the Grallet-Dupic family for 150 years. With the influence of sauternes casks this great value whisky develops a lovely richness with a nose of dates strawberry raspberry passion fruit dried apricot hard candy and mandarin segments in Jell-O. This barrels through flavors of dark orange mandarin coffee after-dinner chocolates cocoa black cherry and bramble and leaves behind a slow burn with flashes of mint and chocolate."
2404,10,"Tropical fruits with burnt peaks on lemon meringue pie but overall a clean and elegant proposition. The nimble palate is a fabulous clash between peach vanilla and candy sherbet sweetness and a deluge of spice. Accomplished and well made this smart and affable whisky from Lorraine’s G. Rozelieures Distillery has a mouth-saturating finish backed by strident spices. (1000 bottles)"
2405,10,"Sticky short ribs from the churrascaria black pepper allspice and a little leather. This is a richly savory whisky with a substantial mouthfeel that’s never chewy. It was matured for 4 years in bourbon wood then finished in oloroso sherry casks creating a palate of figs mixed peel dried chili flakes mocha and whole black peppercorns. Perfectly weighted right down to the ristretto finish with whole wheat digestive biscuits. Bold audacious and voluptuous."
2406,1,"Donnay also makes a peated variant. Again the distillery’s ability to mix the heavy (in this case smoke) with the lifted is demonstrated. Think sage and rosemary mixed with nuts and a really salty tingle that brings to mind eating samphire while the smoke wreathes the palate. Make no mistake this is one important new whisky. £60"
2407,10,"Made by the sea in Côtes d’Armor on direct-fired small stills attached to worm tubs which the French elegantly call condenseurs serpentins. This has smoked fish iodine pine forests driftwood lemon zest and clean medicinal qualities rather than peatiness. Waxed lemon light fudge lemon bonbons and vanilla from the bourbon barrels ride a crescendo of pepper and ginger before smoke obscures all before it. A match for any Islay."
2408,10,"Sebastian Castan only releases his whisky one cask at a time and this variant comes from a single red wine barrel. A dark amber whisky with aromas of vanilla toffee peanut brittle polished oak dried orange peel overripe strawberries Brazil nut and finely ground spices. Delicious but a limited evolution of flavors with dark toffee clove ginger pepper licorice plum red fruit roasted nut dark sugar and chocolate brownies. (1000 bottles)"
2409,4,"Kornog is the peated version of Glann ar Mor and the whisky is released in batches. This one is the most intense with oily charcoally peat most evident. But what makes this whisky particularly special is a dark chocolate and lime candy heart the concentrated pear notes and a refreshing sweet theme that holds off the oil and smoke elsewhere. Think Connemara and you're not far off. €60"
2410,10,"A marriage of three malts matured in cognac casks and new French and American oak brings a nose of fresh Bartlett pear vanilla white pepper cognac zested lime and a rainbow of pâtes de fruits flavors. White fruits fresh banana cantaloupe apricot orange and light spices; the cognac notes yield to let the sweetness of the pear shine through. Short spice finish with melon and slight grapefruit bitterness. (675 bottles for the U.S.)"
2411,10,"Rich supple cognac aromas fit for twilight sipping on a blustery afternoon: cooked apple prune juice cinnamon pecan pie walnut and white pepper. A luscious palate of marron glacé nutmeg dusty cocoa prune toffee apple nutty dark chocolate brownies black truffle and clove. A more rounded darker and better-balanced whisky than the restrained 2016 release with its taut citrus grip. Brenne has found its sweet spot."
2412,10,"This third single cask release was distilled in 2002 and spent two-thirds of its maturation in oloroso after 4 years in bourbon wood. The nose brings cranberry bramble smoked meats over a pit fire stewed apple Worcestershire sauce and damp sphagnum. The taste is silky displaying an array of citrus and red berry fruits. It’s amazingly gentle and tender given the strength. Water brings cider apples ginger and spices with a finish of bubblegum and boiled mint candies. €90"
2413,1,"French whisky encompasses a wide range of approaches and flavors from the hugely aromatic P&M from Corsica to the understated Alsace whiskies of Elsass Meyer’s and Uberbach. There is a trio of whiskies from Brittany. Guy le Lat’s Eddu uses buckwheat to create a whisky that out-ryes rye. Distilerie Warengheim makes the most widely-seen whisky Amorik. But for this writer the one to watch is Glann ar Mor (‘by the sea’) established in 2005 by Jean Donnay. A traditionalist approach: direct fire wooden washbacks wild yeast and worm tubs yield a single malt whisky that though barely over the 3 year legal limit is already complex: think barley sugar and apricot. The fire and the worms give the mid-palate some real weight (boding well for longer-term maturation) but the slow distillation has added floral notes that dance on top. £55"
2414,10,"A little savory at first with burning leaves and green wood aromatic spice mix pastrami malt loaf and Worcestershire sauce. Certainly complex and distinctive from a sensory perspective. Initially there is light vanilla sponge citrus and brown sugar but the vanilla grows stronger combines with malt and meets an angry surge of pepper. The pepper kicks back to peat smoke and then all is right with the world."
2415,10,"Distilled at Lorraine’s G. Rozelieures this whisky from an erudite and cultivated independent bottler has a nose of peach orange buttercream asphalt toasted oak and black peppercorn. On the palate there is citrus vanilla and spice developing more tangy flavors of candied peels orange buttercream and ground pepper. As it softens a little smoke curls around a taste of taffy candy. Hot smoke spice and diminishing citrus notes signify game over. (10000 bottles)"
2416,4,"Brenne is from the Cognac region of France and is becoming an American success story having been launched stateside by Allison Patel but little known elsewhere. After 6 years in French oak 2 years in a Cognac barrel and reduced by the local water to 40% the result is a delicate almost floral eucalyptus and rosewater delight with honeycomb and sweet spice. Very different from a standard malt but very good all the same."
2417,10,"A cask strength expression of Kornog showing great maturity yet born from Glann ar Mor’s small pot stills and condensed through the coils of their worm tubs. The smoke is beguiling; sweet and aromatic with tokens of vanilla and an underlying faceful of Atlantic sea spray. It is sweet fruit-led—especially mango—though the alcohol never dominates more like a sunburst through a cloud. The finish is moreish returning to the salt which only makes you thirsty for another pour. €95"
2418,10,"The spectrum of aromas covers fudge vanilla a tantalizing crush of bitter grapefruit peel lime pith and Jaffa orange with root ginger spring onion and cilantro stalks adding some freshness. A trio of unpeated single malts aged in French oak casks this brings crème de cassis mixed peel burnt toffee chocolate and maltiness with brief reminders of those green herbal notes followed by a pleasing malty-sweet finish."
2419,10,"Distillerie Warenghem’s first peated malt using barley malted to 50 ppm. Waves of coastal character with lemon vanilla marzipan peat smoke and hints of antiseptic. The taste is akin to devouring the best fudge in the world with lemon rich orange peel pepper root ginger and a steadily building cloud of smoke."
2420,4,"Of all the releases I've tasted from this distillery this version is the one that most resembles Glann ar Mor stepping a big step away from the peat and toward the sort of earthy fruitiness that is typified by Glann ar Mor. There are more exotic fruits here too—kiwi and mango perhaps—and something reminiscent of green salad. Surprisingly refreshing. €60"
2421,10,"Gilbert Holl brewed beer in Ribeauvillé but then began to distill his local malted barley to produce the first whisky from Alsace. This 8 year old has an attractively perfumed nose of Parma violets dunnage warehouse and wood smoke with top notes of apricot and peach. Plunge into a thick fruity mouthfeel of melting orange sorbet flecked with lime zest and a moreish mouth-coating finish of tropical fruits. Punching above its weight this is highly recommended (Alsace only) €49"
2422,10,"The peated sibling to Heritage generates a nose of woodsmoke incense sticks oiled leather and peppercorns. This has a thick mouthfeel of honey peat smoke and spiced pears. The spices put on quite a show to keep the fruits at bay but when it settles down the common theme of pears in cream comes through in the end. The spices return to harangue the tongue in the finish. (225 bottles for the U.S.)"
2423,10,"Elegant and dry this Breton whisky from Distillerie Warenghem charms with its nose of digestive biscuits honey barley dry oak dried apricot apple rings roasted coriander seeds and white pepper. The flavor delivery is well balanced with orange honey caramel chocolate vanilla and pepper with the masterful spices quelling the fruitiness in the end. Breton is an endangered language so pour a glass and raise a toast. Yec’hed mat!"
2424,12,"One for the fruit fiends: honeyed apricots tart kumquats candied pineapple dried kiwi and layered spices—ginger cardamom licorice—on the nose. More candied fruit grape soda bubble gum dried apricot and kiwi flood the palate along with licorice and earthy spice on the finish. Add water liberally—the high proof conceals some of the most entrancing flavors."
2425,10,"A well-developed nose of rich toffee blackcurrant red apple and beeswax which incorporates a mild layer of spice. Mandarin orange shines through quite a fleshy texture overall with chocolate buttons and pepper and clove stepping in from the wings; the clove and a bitter note eventually taking center stage. The flavor development complexity and spices are laudable and the texture and weight are distinctively different."
2426,10,"A blend of three malts with a finish in sauternes barrels; the sweet wine gracing the whisky with a light delicate frame. It takes a while to open up unfurling flavors of brioche egg custard walnut baklava ground cumin and a conspicuous vanilla scent. Cinnamon commands the palate supported by peach nectarine and vanilla with a nuttiness and base notes of spice rounding off with cinnamon pepper and baked orange."
2427,10,"Bright fresh fruity and clean with a nose of fresh cream pressed flowers ripening green melon green apple and cut pear mellowing into baked fruit tarts rubbed lemon peel and spice. It’s a very sweet mouthful of sugary candy vanilla fudge lemon bonbon sherbet and fermenting apple laced with a few tangy strands of citrus. A long-lasting sweet finish with lemon and an initial spicy buzz. €84"
2428,4,"Brittany in Northern France has a Celtic heart with its own language and culture. Part of that culture is whisky making. It’s a rugged untamed and robust part of the country so you’d expect similar in the whisky. This is anything but. It is has a sweet fairy dust fruit sherbet nose; a sweet pear cinnamon apple Danish palate; and only late on does a sharp hit of pepper appear. This only enhances the experience. €55 (Currently not available in the U.S.)"
2429,10,"Hailing from the Lorraine region this single malt is double distilled in Charentais pot stills. Orange flesh lemon sherbet strawberry bubble gum candied fruit jellies grapefruit and dry spice with shades of vanilla on the nose. To taste a wishy-washy orange note with a thin structure hung with milk chocolate mango juice papaya wood spice and ground ginger concluding in a pulped-fruit ending."
2430,10,"A sauternes cask-matured whisky from Alsace with a sweet nose of vanilla caramel soft stone fruit macaroon bars and coriander seed. The sluggish palate takes a while to get going with flavors of citrus peel barley sugar and ground ginger. While there’s a medley of fruit and spice it all feels a little half-hearted. Short finish as the fruit fades. (1000 bottles)"
2431,10,"Only four first-fill bourbon barrels have been disgorged for this year’s unpeated release so be quick. Vanilla frosting marzipan white pepper and coconut snowballs emit from the glass. The mouthfeel has a satin sheen with flavors of sweet honey peach syrup orange segments ground pepper and some almond nuttiness. It holds its poise as it gently dilutes comforting like a warm blanket over your taste buds. A few drops of water produce a rounder sweeter experience. €60"
2432,10,"Meaning double cask this was designed as an easy-drinking summer style of Alsatian whisky created from a balanced proportion of two casks finished separately in local Riesling and Gewürztraminer barrels. The nose is light and crisp with peach pear lime zest grapefruit gooseberry and rose-flavored Turkish delight. A sweet velutinous palate sufficiently weighted with grapefruit and lime. A little malted barley pokes through the gooseberry. Quite distinctive which counts in today’s market. €45"
2434,10,"A much darker dram with smoke from log fires chocolate toasted oak crispy bacon and dark toffee but this really drills home the smoke which dominates over the other characteristics. Toffee malt dark cherry smoking oak cinnamon and pepper but tasting is a rather linear experience. Some redeeming qualities but it lacks the focus of the rest of the range. Finish of banana loaf and singed fruitcake."
2435,4,"Bearing the easiest name of all the Kornogs to pronounce this is also the least challenging and complex. It is pretty much a straightforward peated whisky with more citrus fruits than the others some apple and pear in the mix and some chilled spices. The finish is long smoky and spicy. Benefits massively from a little water. €86"
2436,10,"If you cannot wait for Jean Donnay to start distilling at Gartbreck on Islay console yourself with this Celtic whisky made by the sea with malt peated to 35-40 ppm. The nose has hard dry peat cold charred logs and heather twigs but enough creamy sweetness to keep it buoyant. It shimmers and twists on the tongue showing shades of light and dark. Nuts treacle licorice and raisins emerge though the structure shows its youth. Dry sooty finish. €60"
2437,4,"This is another young peated whisky but the earthy and dusty smoke is wrapped around a honeycomb and milk chocolate center. It’s both rugged and comforting the whisky equivalent of chili chocolate: a bittersweet love affair for those who enjoy the contrary nature of sweet and savory. €77 (Currently not available in the U.S.)"
2438,10,"Fresh sharp citrus with lighter elements: floral notes orange macaroons and wisps of cotton candy. Lemon peel tinned mandarin and tangy grapefruit on the palate with deeper notes of lemon curd gooseberry confectioners’ sugar and a minor spice note. This delivers a narrow spectrum of flavor for a blend."
2439,10,"Seaweed piled in a beach bonfire Keemun tea hide-covered tomes and toffee apples. Soupy salty smoke without the heat on this dram which was matured for 6 years in first-fill oloroso. The flavors bring an array of apple peelings cough sweets aniseed and roasted sesame seed before developing some savory elements of roast pork. A spicy tingle takes you through to the finish. Water coaxes out apple jelly and pear notes. (1000 bottles) €58"
2440,4,"What a pleasant change: a world whisky America can get hold of and Europe can't. This is a tiny French single malt whisky launched first in the U.S. This is very good with honey date liquid chocolate honeycomb and some spice bite. But it's also very unusual and my warning lights have come on: Brenne is released in single casks so they vary dramatically. It's made by a French cognac maker."
2441,4,"Armorik is made by Distilleries Warenghem in the Brittany region of Northern France and you expect something gutsy and rugged. This is nothing of the sort though the relatively high strength and the fact that it's non-chill filtered ensure plenty of taste including a scattering of spices that tickle and tingle the palate at the finish. Before then though the key flavors are vanilla honeyed cereal overripe melon and banana. Delightful.  €38"
2442,4,"The price tag — higher than the entry level single malt — gives an indication as to what to expect from this blend and it's a cracker. Made with 50 percent grain and 50 percent malt the taste here is punctuated by a distinctive and unusual salt and pepper delivery. Beyond that there's creamy vanilla soft peach and a creamy rounded finish. It really dares to be different. €32"
2443,4,"Armorik has been making whisky for more than twelve years; it's growing in confidence and the quality is improving. There's peat in the malt here and it gives the whisky a feisty and earthy quality. The spirit is matured first in Armorik oak barrels and then transferred to sherry. Sherry and peat is a tough trick to pull off and this just about gets away with it with coastal brine and lemon rubbing up against wood smoke barley and honey. €38"
2444,4,"When introducing new world whisky I tell folks to treat it not as a scotch but as a totally different whisky. But how far can you go? The French have a “whisky” made with buckwheat — technically not a grain — and chestnuts. Now we have this. This is light sweet with flavored candy and fruit jelly; lots of pruney grapey Cognac notes. There's the issue. Is it a nice drink? Yes. Is it really a whisky? It's up for debate."
2445,1,"It’s not compulsory to follow a Scottish way of whisky making. M. Olivier Perrier in the village of Herisson the middle of the Auvergne has taken a bourbon base (65% corn with malted barley and rye) and distilled it in a Cognac-style alembic before aging it for three years in Troncais oak. Any thoughts that M.Perrier is digging deep into his terroir can be quickly dismissed: the recipe is one for moonshine extracted from a South Carolina musician! His whisky (or should that be whiskey?) is fat and oily with lots of corn and the scented note that these French whiskies all seem to share. It has a palate where the deep and the savory dance around each other that while not exactly controlled would be perfect to accompany an evening of blues in the middle of France. €37"
2446,4,"There are big similarities with this whisky and those being produced at nearby Glann ar Mor. The dominant flavors are soft and sweet and there's a distinctly soft and feminine side to this single malt which skips across the palate. There are floral and green fruit notes here traces of oak barley and sweet spice all very ordered. Not complicated maybe but very well made indeed.  €20"
2447,10,"A delicious example of a developing national style this characterful whisky revels in peppery wood spices that obscure faint strands of vanilla fudge and soft fruitiness supported by toasted coconut rock cakes and burnt banana loaf. Soft caramel nectarine and the grip of dusty oak under the menace of an approaching storm of pepper and clove spices subside to leave barrel char heather honey and cinnamon-spiced muffins."
2448,10,"Made from smoked Icelandic barley the nose has earthy mushroom-farm notes with herbs damp grass cuttings tree sap toasted nuts and fresh barley top notes. This begs to be poured over ice cream; sweet malt and banoffee caramel spill over the taste buds with toasted almonds ripe banana and an edge of spice. The thick heavy mouthfeel negotiates cinnamon burnt sugar subtle smoke and blackened wood to finish."
2449,10,"Iceland’s first single malt is 3 years old and finished in American oak casks originally used for Flóki Young Malt (not sold in the U.S.). The nose is pleasant and light with sweet malt lemon-butter biscuits orange zest and mellow wood spices. Light-bodied with red apple peelings and a slow build of spices honey toasted waffle cone baking chocolate dark vanilla and crumbled Oreos."
2450,10,"Orchard fruit applesauce barley sugar macadamia nut white pepper and light spicy aromas with toasted brioche bringing a touch of sweetness. The palate is fruity with apple and sultanas draped in honey and caramel peppery spice with orange and lemon peel and late baked citrus on the finish. A pleasing dram though if you’re drawn to Flóki looking for unconventional flavors and idiosyncratic methods this is a more traditional whisky."
2451,11,"Labeled “young malt” because it is only about 18 months old. Distilled from Icelandic-grown malted barley as a whole mash (not a filtered wash) in a pot still it has a nice husky cocoa hull note in the sweet somewhat hot malt nose. Full mouthfeel rich grain character dry cocoa hulls and just before the dusty malt finish there’s an eye-opening wash of sweetness. Good potential and an interesting character. (Travel Retail in Iceland only) ISK 7950/500 ml"
2452,10,"An intense and enthralling whisky on the nose with honey brown sugar and caramel then molasses cooked fruit vanilla shredded orange peel chocolate and baking spices yet it still retains a barley freshness. This elegantly carries its potent ABV with aplomb producing a palate of baked orange dried pineapple malt milk chocolate and a cascade of spice sugar caramelized fruits and toasted oak. Simply incredible. (900 bottles 300 for U.S.) Collectible"
2453,10,"Although it sounds more like the warped master plan of a sinister Bond villain it’s actually named after the four different woods in Amrut’s second wave of spectrum casks. Prune stone dried fig black cherry flesh raspberry cinnamon and a hint of macchiato aromas. Dense concentrated cherry and sultana cooked apple and pear heavy spices and fruit and nut chocolate. Finish of hot sticky dates and baked orchard fruit. Commendable."
2454,4,"A whopping three-quarters of the spirit put in these casks was taken by greedy angels. It has a big waft of crystallized pineapple tropical fruits and spiky spice on the nose. On the palate red licorice syrupy jellied fruits some mandarin cherry lozenge and tinned strawberries and the same menthol rancio you’d kill for in a 30 year old scotch. This is Amrut's oldest-ever whisky; it's as rare as hen's teeth…and just 8 years old. Awesome."
2455,12,"Sweet saline peat on the nose along with red berries milk chocolate hazelnuts dates and nougat. It’s lush and rich qualities that extend to the palate’s oily dense character which is floral and soapy before shifting into plummy red berry fruit dark chocolate roasted hazelnuts and a panoply of spices. The finish is ashy peppery sweet and mouthwatering with long lingering smokiness. Water is a must to showcase the rounded powerfully flavorful balance of this whisky. (360 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
2456,10,"Rejoice! Those greedy angels have left sufficient liquid behind in the Amrut warehouse for a new release. Chocolate ganache dark fudge rye bread toasted fennel seed overripe mango lavender and parma violet aromas. It’s divine: chocolate brownie orange peel espresso bramble candied fruit jellies toffee and blackened oak with a finish of fruity chocolate. Repay such celestial avarice by acquiring some of this heavenly whisky for yourself. (180 bottles for the U.S.)"
2457,12,"Fragrant exotic spices permeate the nose like a perfumy incense shot through with sandalwood; there’s also black currant cooked plums crushed raspberries dark chocolate and pineapple. The intensity of the nose builds on the palate as rich flavors of lime zest mango raspberry jam and dark chocolate swirl with the pull of oak tannins. The finish loses none of the tension between spirit and cask balancing the dueling richesse of dark chocolate-covered pineapple and polished oak. (90 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
2458,12,"Expressive and aromatic on the nose with mingling aromas of spiced smoke—like burning
sage—dried herbs sandalwood rose petal and citrus oil. Its high proof equals big flavor on the
palate: a rush of guava pineapple and kiwi dusted with cinnamon then almond pipe tobacco
and mocha. Adding water brings out more savory notes that meld seamlessly with the spice nuts
and rich dark chocolate. The lush finish swirls with chocolate raisins bitter almonds and
tropical fruit. You’d be forgiven for thinking this was sherry cask-finished but it’s actually from
a single bourbon barrel. (120 bottles; Norfolk Wine & Spirits exclusive)"
2459,10,"With exceptional flavors across the nose mouthfeel and palate this delivers great flavor both at cask strength and at various dilutions. Strong aromas of barley mingle with thick peach puree fruity syrups grassy notes barley sugars and orange Jell-O. Sweet and rich with tropical flavors of mango passion fruit papaya and baked peach it handles the high alcohol and builds through a slow crescendo in flavor to reach the peak. (120 bottles for Norfolk Whisky Group)"
2460,10,"Highly charged aromatics with vanilla pod butterscotch dried orchard and tropical fruits orange peel and rancio developing notes of stewed fruit rubbed mint and early spring florals in time. A melee of stewed fruit hard candy citrus peel toffee and caramel on the palate with an accompanying rumble of gentle spices and an interjection of lemon and lime. The fruit fades like an ebbing tide leaving pepper and clove behind."
2461,12,"Indian single malt distillers like Amrut and Paul John turn out first-rate whiskies that measure up to the most venerable names in scotch. Rampur a single malt from Radico Khaitan Distillery in the foothills of the Himalayas is the newest ambassador for this blossoming whisky nation. Indian-grown six-row barley provides biscuity malt aromas that undergird a cornucopia of tropical melon papaya and soft yellow jackfruit. The oily palate coats the mouth with cocoa grilled pineapples hibiscus blossoms and tingling spices. With its exceptional long finish Rampur may set America on a path to truly appreciating Indian whisky’s style and terroir. Number 5 in the 2017 Top 20"
2462,10,"Amrut’s chimeric five-wood cask has been one of the greatest whisky innovations of this year. The aromas release Madagascan chocolate the fruitiness of Panamanian Geisha coffee a sturdy granite core new oak extractives fresh walnuts wood spices treacle and mango peel. Like velvet the palate develops lush fruits Gianduja chocolate rich dark coffee nut oils and oak tannins before the red juicy fruits soak through the chocolate. Heat dry spices and ground coffee finish. Clever concept: a seminal whisky. £100"
2463,10,"A deeply satisfying and fragrant whisky finished in Indian cabernet sauvignon casks producing a nose of damsons a thick layer of aromatic spices vanilla essence pipe tobacco and black currant. A bounty of autumnal fruits: blackberry plum jam and blueberry plus toffee pepper and clove. As the fruit releases its grip spices honey red cherry and candied peel emerge leaving a notably dry finish."
2464,10,"What’s a rye single malt you ask? It’s 100% malted rye distilled in pot stills bursting with rye spices thick toffee malt loaf chocolate licorice burnt sugar and tropical fruits. Praline cinnamon and burnt orange flavors succumb to an assault of spice tropical fruits and licorice ending with virgin American oak char before a gum-numbing aniseed finish of Fisherman’s Friends. Water just mutes the enjoyment so leave it."
2465,4,"The whisky gets its name from the fact that 57.1% ABV is 100 proof in the British measuring system: the alcohol concentration needed to sustain flaming gunpowder. It comes in 100 cl bottles and only 100 bottles are being released in each territory. This malt takes no prisoners with big bold flavors dominated by peat but with chutney-style fruit and an array of spice making for a rich intense taste experience."
2466,10,"The dark chestnut liquid results from maturation in bourbon and port casks and it has an equally enticing nose: squishy prunes dried fig blackcurrant sour cherry apple tarts and nutmeg. The concentration of fruit on the palate circulates around dark cherry red apple and raspberry flavors. Then vanilla caramel and milk chocolate flood the mouth and everything turns deliciously gooey. Go on give in to your urges. (240 bottles for the U.S.)"
2467,10,"The color of polished horse chestnuts with the opulent aroma of mature vintage port this concentrates the fruits around a firm spicy core with red Twizzlers and a mischievous smirk of hot paprika. Red jelly and black grape flavors tangle with oak tannins vanilla pod red apple clove black pepper plain chocolate and vanilla essence. An almost local-anesthetic effect on the tongue at cask strength so dilute liberally. (360 bottles)"
2468,4,"This release is a port version of Amrut’s Intermediate Sherry — a sort of port pipe sandwich. The spirit is matured in both unused casks and bourbon casks then spends a few months in port pipes and then returns to bourbon casks. The result is a Pink Floyd show of a whisky: vibrant colorful complex and nearly too much. A blackcurrant and wispy smoky nose gives way to an intense and bittersweet mix of chili blackcurrant oak damson dark chocolate and peat. Astounding."
2469,10,"The smoke on the nose is comfortingly thick and peaty layered over cooked peaches in syrup mango and hints of ripening strawberry becoming almost gum-like with a back wall of oak and mild dry spices. On the palate intense fruitiness assails the senses with bitter plain chocolate spices and smoke. Be kind and add a generous dash of water or prepare your taste buds for a pummeling from the cask-strength alcohol. (900 bottles 150 for U.S.)"
2470,10,"This limited edition is quite a color: deep orange with beautiful rose tints. Quite vinous on the nose with orange peel crème brûlée honey toasted coconut grated chocolate and preserved lemons all benefiting from the higher bottling strength. It’s darkly sweet with piquant plums juicy raisins sweet shortbread fig chocolate honeyed lemons and tangy candied peel. Truly excellent the spice dominating the dark fruits and chocolate throughout the finish. (4800 bottles)"
2471,4,"Another hard to get Indian whisky but further proof that the category isn't a one-trick pony. This single cask release is the second from the John Distilleries and a significant step upward. An altogether more complex whisky with an earthy prickly peat at one level and a rich pureed pear heart with orange fruit and berries. The combination is quite gorgeous and with a little water you get whisky's answer to a summertime flower show. Impressive stuff. £60"
2472,10,"The distillery founded in 1943 lies in Uttar Pradesh in the Himalayan foothills where they have been making whisky for 25 years. Chocolate coffee dried cranberry and dark toffee notes. Across the tongue chocolate-dipped dried fruit and citrus peel apple strawberry raspberry malt and glimpses of cinnamon ginger and star anise. Great quality whisky the flavor plateaus through to a medium-length finish of ginger with bitter cocoa notes."
2473,10,"Definitely one to taste. The nose offers up allspice moderate peat smoke pomegranate dried peel and ground almonds. The palate is superb; milk chocolate caramels assertive smoke and peppercorn then a slow warm slide into coffee cocoa and licorice becoming lush and velvety in texture. Paradoxically the more diluted it becomes the thicker and more substantial it seems to taste. Long finish of coffee and chocolate. (Batch 4)"
2474,10,"Blender Anup Barik follows up his No. 5 whisky of our Top 20 of 2017 by deploying a Pedro Ximénez sherry-butt finish to the same winning formula. Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups tiffin honeydew cherry cinnamon nutmeg and hints of vanilla. A mouth-clinging concoction of swirling honeys and caramel kumquat redcurrant banoffee pie chocolate ganache and cinnamon with emerging pepper and clove highlighting the blender’s enhancement of flavor by the finishing vessel."
2475,10,"With the magnificent Mysore Palace on its label and a nose of garam masala overripe banana coffee bean hazelnut and prune juice this is definitely an Amrut to experience. Flavors ebb and flow through cereal notes Agen prunes raisins vanilla essence dried fruits stewed apple and dark autumnal fruits all underpinned by glittering spicy base notes. It finishes with cola-flavored candy dwindling sweetness and encroaching leathery notes. (Editors' Choice)"
2476,12,"Clean and sweet on the nose with confectionary aromas of vanilla coconut lemon curd shortbread and almond halva; there’s also concentrated orchard fruit milk chocolate and jasmine. It’s dry and chewy on the palate with plenty to enjoy—spiced plums raspberries incense milk chocolate—though the complexity flattens out into the finish which is sweet with vanilla custard milk chocolate fresh raspberries and lingering floral notes. (108 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
2477,10,"Smoked meat paprika cumin peppercorn and star anise amid fragrant smoke and maple bacon. The flavors are supremely fruity with tangerine marmalade lime zest and pineapple juice. Among the fruit is a cascade of aromatic spices before the interjection of a most compelling sour fruit note and the smokiness takes charge. It’s certainly no Islay mimic this terrific Indian whisky demonstrates it has the courage of its own convictions."
2478,10,"A whisky to settle down with for the night with its lavish nose of chocolate cappuccino cocoa powder dried cherry and toasted spices. Rich and fruity with initial chocolate and cocoa flavors the high alcohol is mouth drawing and purses the lips. At cask strength there are flavors of apple a spike of clove and pepper and a finish of plain dark chocolate but dilute to accentuate the fruity elements. (480 bottles for Whiskey Neat TX)"
2479,9,"Balance complexity and surprising maturity for its age -- these are the defining characteristics of the best Indian whisky I have ever tasted. Amrut is doing some great things and this whisky just elevated them to a new level. Combining Indian malt and Scottish peated malt this whisky shows a sweet side but is never cloying with rich caramel vanilla custard and fruit cocktail in light syrup balanced by vibrant -- almost floral -- dried peat smoke delicate white pepper and a hint of tropical fruit (toasted coconut pineapple). Soothing lingering smoke finish. I look forward to more great whiskies from Amrut."
2480,10,"What I love about this is that it’s fresh and fruity with plenty of zip. The nose has hard candy fresh laundry floral notes apple and peach puree. A fruit medley with nectarine pear and satsuma followed by vanilla lime almond and five spice becoming more rounded with apple and fudge and a spiced citrus finish. Best Value"
2481,4,"Proof if it were still needed that Amrut intends to cement its position as the leading innovator in world whisky. Kadhambam is the sweetest of Amruts as a result of a complex maturation process that has seen peated Amrut matured in local brandy and rum casks. There's a liqueur-like edge to it as a result but it's a complex malt with cherry blossom peppercorn and apple peel in the mix. Not the distillery's best but very very drinkable."
2482,4,"A cask strength single cask bottling available through one UK outlet this is still worthy of inclusion because it's further proof that India and Asia have the potential to produce world-class malts. This is just 3 years old but it's blemish-free and packed with flavor. Orange lemon and berries battle it out with jasmine cinnamon and nutmeg and although my sample is marked 'unpeated' and a fully peated version is planned for 2013 there's still some earthiness at the core. Very good indeed. £60"
2483,10,"Thick treacle chocolate glaze sooty fireplaces spearmint coal dust roasted hazelnut charcoal logs and earthen warehouse floors make quite an impression. It’s shot through with mouth-puckering tart juiciness plum fig and smoke and though it becomes fatter and richer the ashy core continues to blow until it finishes leaving behind char and cocoa. Water provokes some juicy apple notes and sweetens the finish but despite the ABV you should experience this at cask strength. Ride the bull! (148 bottles) £89"
2484,10,"magine there’s a janitor sweeping up the bisected fruit fallen from that fruit-slicing app: cherries cooked peach lingonberry orange peel fresh apple fruit syrup waxy leaves and taffy chews. Plump mouthfeel with sweet baked fruits it’s sticky and concentrated with a fabulous fruitiness at this strength. Sugared apple baked orange tart plum clove and aniseed. Unpeated and matured for around 7 years. A lot of buck for the bang. (1500 bottles)"
2485,10,"Where Batch 4 is peaty Batch 5 is smoky joining aromas of after-dinner mints rich orange fondant creams salted caramel and sour fruits. On sipping mint chocolate finds accord with the nose before a summit of smoke and pepper then apple milk chocolate creamy coffee and late black currant notes. The smoke hangs deep at the back of the throat. Good flavor trajectory and complexity with a drying chocolate finish.(822 bottles)"
2486,9,"Aged in bourbon casks then sherry casks then finished in bourbon casks. An interesting (and original?) approach but is it worth all the effort? I think so. The sherry notes are clean not cloying and there’s plenty of oak resin on the palate for texture and to balance the sherry’s sweetness. Liqueur-ish fruit (orange raspberry cherry caramelized peach) along with a good peppering of dried spice (vanilla ginger cinnamon anise). Distinctive resin on the finish props up the rest of the flavors."
2487,4,"Paul John is taking its entry into the world of single malt very seriously and very slowly but surely. After two single cask offerings to find its range Brilliance and Edited are its first general releases. Brilliance is unpeated and is a delight: rich full young but not immature and with lime and citrus Starburst chews sweet candy and some icing sugar it trips across the palate. Conclusive proof that Amrut isn’t the only Indian game in town."
2488,4,"Two Continents refers to the fact that this is matured in India and then Europe. But Amrut has tweaked the winning formula of the first edition taking the alcoholic strength from 46% to 50% and using bourbon instead of grain casks for European maturation. The changes are immediately noticeable. The nose is honeyed with key lime pie and strawberries and cream. The taste is spikier spicier and feistier than before with dark cherry blood orange and unripe banana."
2489,10,"Earthy notes with plain chocolate nibs malt drinks and a little leather. There’s a subtle smoky air; nothing too astringent or overpowering. It’s great to try if you’re new to peaty whiskies or were put off by a peat colossus from Islay. Fig plums and soft prunes though it’s mouth-puckering neat so cut it down. Then the fruit rounds out beautifully allowing some gentle spices to shine through with some coffee bean notes at the end. Terrific stuff. £68"
2490,10,"This new peated expression exhibits the billowing rich smoke of burning fruitwoods warm banana-and-honey muffins and caramelized brown sugar granules seared onto puff pastry. Tasting this evokes spiced apple cinnamon and orange peel with more peat coming through mid-palate mingled with Brazil nut menthol eucalyptus clove and peppermint. A warming glow trickles slowly down leaving hot smoke and menthol behind. With whisky of this quality master distiller Michael John will only gain further followers of his work. £40"
2491,10,"Great to see an age statement on this second Boutique-y Paul John release. It’s aromatic with hoisin sauce sweet plums clove black pepper and a cloud of heady peat smoke. Sweet dark toffees vanilla apple danish poached pear and baked orange swim above an undercurrent of peppery spice. Water provokes more smoke on the nose more apples on the palate. The dry finish leaves singed vanilla and the satisfaction that you’re puffing out perfect smoke rings through pursed lips. (173 bottles) £100"
2492,10,"Made from Indian barley the nose is soft fruity and spicy. There’s cooked apples in crème anglaise ripe apricot sweet barley nectarine fresh mango sticky cotton candy and dry oak spices. Creaminess continues on the palate with apple aromatic spices of pepper ginger and aniseed with passion fruit clementine and zested limes. This should be your starting point for exploring Amrut’s whiskies."
2493,4,"Edited is the medium peated version of Paul John and will be followed later in the year with a big peated one. This will do for now though. The whisky is once more intense and fruity but this time it plays off against a more herbal green apple note smoke from the hearth and a touch of spice. There’s also cinnamon—which is fast becoming a house style. Encouraging stuff."
2494,10,"The first of three Iron Dram single cask Amrut whiskies released for the European market. The Pedro Ximénez cask certainly has the upper hand here. Black cherry dried cranberry blueberry and mixed peel mingle with apple peelings baked pear thick-skinned sultanas and chocolate frosting. Tart piquancy to the fore on the palate but it melts to show glacé cherry baked apples pear and ground almonds. Water brings the childhood sweetness of old-fashioned Kola Kubes. Oodles of character. £77"
2495,10,"We can thank Bangalore’s climate for the arrival of this 2009 distillate. Honeycomb vanilla shortbread crispy tart shells graham crackers and malt extract make for an attractive proposition. It tiptoes onto the tongue but within seconds you get the thundering sense of its full strength approaching. Dried fruits wood spices malt loaf chewy caramels shortbread biscuits with Horlicks malted milk on the finish. A dash of water triggers a sensation of plump raspberries dipped in chocolate. £59"
2496,10,"Sticky spiced-coconut desserts grapefruit clove allspice and crispy bacon on the nose of this NAS whisky matured in bourbon casks. Sharp with lime grapefruit and lemon zest that settle down to green fruits Jell-O and dry spices. Do dilute as water lets the spices leap from the glass strips down the acidic attack and accentuates the fresh apple and cinnamon. It doesn’t need much water but it’s eminently better with a dash. £63"
2497,9,"Good balance between ripe barley rum-like sweetness and damp kiln smoke. Dried oak spice bourbon char brine and anise add complexity peaking on the finish. An interesting contrast to the other Amrut whiskies. This whisky could pass for a youthful Islay malt."
2498,10,"Amrut ingeniously flavored an oloroso cask with wine and orange peel for 3 years before finishing this highly innovative whisky in it. A warmth and richness exudes the citrus intensity of peel and orange oils develops the longer you resist temptation. Dried fruits apricot heather ripe mango triple sec with a slight mustiness. Syrupy soft orange pulp with zested limes makes it quite nippy. Finish of gum and wood notes after a spicy start. Whatever you do drink it neat. (Europe Canada and Asia; 900 bottles) £75"
2499,10,"Full port maturation has been tried by distilleries great and small. What does the cask contribute to the spirit beyond being soaked in port? Empress plums and bramble jelly meet smoke in the form of snuffed candlewicks and smoldering cedar sticks. At cask strength it’s sharp and puckering but after the plummy opener fades there is rosehip licorice zested lime and a squirt of lemon. Water keeps the licorice but bottoms out the sweetness for a mouth-filling dram. £82"
2500,9,"Similar to the standard Amrut except that it's drier and spicier with suggestions of bourbon. Not as creamy as the standard expression but a bit more sophisticated."
2501,9,"A mouth-coating whisky and oily in texture. Ripe vanilla malt peaches & cream polished oak roasted nuts and a hint of coconut cream pie. Soothing creamy finish. A pleasant “anytime” dram. Bottled at 46% to better display its fine textures and subtle nuances."
2502,7,"This 13 year old malt from central Ireland is an uncommon foray into the Irish whiskey space for the Exclusive Malts Collection. Pure malt is the focus of the nose which supports that malt with tart green apple. On the palate this whiskey is a stunning mix of lush sweet honey salt malt green apple and ginger spice. The balance and integration are nothing short of perfect. A long malty finish caps off one of the best Irish whiskeys I’ve had. (U.S. only)"
2503,10,"Wow—the nose is spellbinding. An exuberant mix of heavy fruit and deep sweetness: crème brûlée vanilla pod fruit syrups sticky jam tarts and apricot stone. Silken mouthfeel with orange flan and brown sugar growing increasingly tangy with peppery spice rippling over the tongue and hints of smoke at the end. Oak char and marzipan fruits on the finish. The bar has been set high for Irish whiskey this year. (5000 bottles)"
2504,9,"Antique gold. It’s the only 'pure pot still' whiskey produced at the Midleton distillery that’s available in the U.S. and its impact on the whiskey is enormous. Its flavors continue to evolve and are perfectly balanced with notes of lush fruit toffee fudge almonds and vanilla. It finishes long with mature oak notes that linger. More seductive and not as bold as Jameson Gold. This is the definitive Irish whiskey-it's as simple as that! It will satisfy both Scotch and Irish whiskey drinkers. Don't come whining to me several months from now because you didn't get a bottle! Buy it now while you still can."
2505,4,"Wow! After the wonderful 12 year old cask strength Redbreast does it again. This is a different beast altogether but it is a stunner. This is Roger Waters doing The Wall: over the top unsubtle and totally entertaining. There’s lots going on: fermenting apples juicy oils spice and dark cherry and berry fruits zip and fizz over the palate the wood influence is sublime. I'm comfortably numb."
2506,9,"Rich silky and oily in texture. Extremely well-integrated flavors loaded with ripe berries caramelized banana nougat date nut bread glazed tangerine and maple syrup peppered with warming cinnamon vanilla icing and nutmeg. Firm dry resinous finish to balance the sweetness. I love the pot still character and the lushness that some of the port-wood aging has imparted. If anything even richer and more lush than the previous 2007 vintage I reviewed. Another classic Jameson Rarest Vintage Reserve."
2507,9,"Jameson’s newest premium release. The combination of aging some of the pot still whiskey in port casks including some older whiskeys (over 20 years old) and bottling at 46% ABV (and not chill-filtered) has helped make this a rich deep and complex spirit. This is a silky smooth lush multi-faceted whiskey with notes of honeydew melon nectarine banana bread creamy vanilla chocolate fudge toffee warming cinnamon and nutmeg. The port influence marries nicely with robust oak notes and the grain whiskey component helps to keep it very drinkable. A more intense affair when compared to the “great anytime” 18 year old expression. A classic after-dinner Irish whiskey."
2508,9,"Deep amber color with shade of ruby. Sweet aromas of ripe fruit oak caramelized sugar rum and creamy vanilla. Full in body for an Irish whiskey with a silky creamy texture. Voluptuous flavors of burnt sugar rum honeyed fruit creamy vanilla and spice cake.Here's a whiskey the blends the old with the new. The whiskey was distilled at the old Midleton distillery which has been dismantled. After spending most of its life in sherry and bourbon casks it was then finished off in port pipes. It maintains its Irish-ness its pot still character is both satisfying and reassuring and the port pipe aging introduces flavors that make the whiskey very intriguing. An outstanding product! Around 400 bottles for the United States."
2509,10,"After marrying in sauternes casks for many years this bourbon-matured 1991
distillate has become epic stuff. Aromas of dried apricot cooked apple roasted
aromatic spices red grape candied peel dried fig smoked butter and singed
fruitcake. The palate purrs like a contented cat. It’s dark and syrupy with treacle
cooked plum a touch of peppery spice and a medicinal finish of cough drops and
aniseed. (4000 bottles) €500"
2510,10,"This gorgeous whiskey has taken on a lot of sherry character from the refill sherry hogshead: cherry prune chocolate orange baked pineapple chunks and toasted spice. A good weighty structure boasting deep citrus intensity with ginger and pepper snapping at its heels; a sensation only intensified with water. Lush fruits butterscotch and milk chocolate with a finish of lively spices stone fruits and zesty orange muffins. (276 bottles)"
2511,9,"Finished in a rum cask. Very creamy with a soothing sweetness. Notes of vanilla demerara sugar nougat and subtle tropical fruit (coconut pineapple mango) coat the palate. All this is balanced nicely by resinous oak and a peppering of dried spices that linger on the finish. The rum finish along with the 46% bottling strength adds backbone and flair. One of the best whiskeys to come out of Cooley. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
2512,9,"Complex on the nose and the flavors just dance on the palate. This whiskey is bright cleanly malty and quite fruity with a tropical accent -- peach mango cantaloupe sultana and caramelized pineapple. Balanced by notes of honey vanilla cream and soft coconut. The best Cooley whiskey I have ever tasted!"
2513,10,"Cranberry red apple candied peel glacé cherry red licorice and black pepper with
heather honey florals and festive spices on the nose. A fruity concoction of cherry lip
balm cranberry sauce caramel peppercorn and a hint of apple the fruit sails through
as the spice and sugar fade. Water softens the impact but widens the flavor spectrum
to embrace plum orange walnut and cranberry. Price per 500 ml. (912 bottles) €490"
2514,10,"The nose is superb with oat and pecan flapjack cocoa powder nutmeg star anise and caramelized brown sugar. Golden syrup laced with strands of citrus swim within a smooth thickly textured malt. A rich sweetness spills over unctuous with sweet honey and nuts over a base layer of spice. Confident self-assured expressive whiskey."
2515,9,"Deep amber color. Richly flavored aroma with notes of toffee raisins dates honeyed malt and demerara rum. Medium in body and richly textured. Toffee & rum-like flavors entertain the palate first followed by chocolate covered raisins and dates. The whiskey then begins to dry out mid-palate as the 21 years in oak becomes evident contributing notes of vanilla and subtle mint. Dry finish with lingering notes of oak and polished leather. This is a delicious whiskey that should appeal to both the Irish and Scotch whisk(e)y drinker. Aged initially in sherry and bourbon casks the whiskey was then finished in Madeira casks. It is complex in flavor and very well balanced. It is one of the best Irish whiskeys on the market. This whiskey has been a long time comin' but it was worth the wait."
2516,4,"Well the name's spot on because at that price it definitely brought tears to this writer's eyes. What a shame because the liquid is eye-watering too a stunning big bruiser of a whiskey that coats the mouth as berry and green fruits battle it out with oak spice and grain oils — the whiskey equivalent to one of singer Sinead O'Connor's rants — powerful impressive a little bitter and twisted utterly unforgettable and unmistakably Irish. €135"
2517,9,"Deeper thicker and more lush than the Madeira Cask Finish reviewed above. Notes of strawberry preserve caramel apple nougat sponge cake and a hint of chocolate cream pie. All these sweet richly textured flavors without being cloying. Nicely done."
2518,10,"William Brabazon 3rd Earl of Meath once presided over Newmarket the area of Dublin the Teeling Distillery now calls home. Clean lemon-ozone character with peach apricot and melon the sherry finessing the distillery character. There’s further fruitiness apparent on the palate; oaky chardonnay notes more melon and warm orange though the strength burns through. Grapefruit and gooseberry sharpness keeps this zingy and fresh above a sweet toffee base. €78"
2519,10,"Every so often whether by blind luck or meticulous searching a brilliant cask turns up. Fruit pastilles peaches in syrup caramelized apples freshly baked bread and lemons weeping juice supported by the smoke from the glowing red fringes of burning newspaper. Lemon and grapefruit acidity in the mouth developing creaminess vanilla and more tropical fruit characteristics with some slightly bitter char surfacing after a minute. Candied grapefruit follows into the finish as the smoke rolls in. Rather glorious. (The Whisky Exchange only) £165"
2520,9,"This is what the standard Bushmills Malt 10 year old should taste like. A classic Irish whiskey nose. Deliciously sweet creamy notes of vanilla marshmallow honey powdered sugar and polished oak. Faint tropical fruit notes emerge from time to time. Very clean on the palate with a dry bourbon-like finish. Those extra few years in wood along with being non-chill-filtered add richness depth and complexity."
2521,10,"Named after the founding date of Dunville’s Irish whiskey this stellar blend combines barley honey finely ground pepper nutmeg and aniseed balls with light vanilla and soft fudge aromas. The beautiful transition through phases of flavor is impressive: light citrus vanilla and honey initially becoming tangy with orange flan and mandarin then hitting a baked orange note as the sweetness rises. Spices push through concluding with cantaloupe and mango notes."
2522,10,"More peated and peated cask-finished Irish whiskeys are emerging and this one is no half-measure. It’s smoky but balanced with vanilla sponge lemon zest golden syrup rock pools iodine and maritime notes with a whiff of creosote. Elegant and smooth with vanilla cream lemon meringue pie and developing creamy fudge notes with pepper and smoke. Lots of top-quality American oak at play and plenty of smoke on the finish."
2523,10,"Substantial wood character caramel-drizzled pecans pears poached in red wine and bananas Foster balanced handsomely by the pot still spice. Sweet orchard fruits—from pulpy pear to a rounded Cox’s apple note—plus dark toffee the heat of red chiles red currant more wood and milk chocolate. A soothing finish with raisins and a flare of spices that linger with the fruit. Dark and wood-driven but this never topples the balance. €95"
2524,10,"Roll out the red carpet because Green Spot is coming to town. Baked apple spiced sultanas lush green lawns and ripe green fruits greet the nose. It’s oily smothering and luxuriantly juicy with a depth of character that tips over the back of the tongue like nectar. That mélange of light vanilla butterscotch and creamy rice pudding sprinkled with nutmeg is heavenly. If this doesn’t persuade you to fall in love with Irish pot still whiskey then nothing will."
2525,10,"Oh hello there. Meaning hand in hand in two languages this Redbreast was solely matured in Galician oak seasoned with oloroso for 2 years at the Páez Morilla bodega in Jerez. A slightly closed nose of eucalyptus menthol and apple pre-empts a rich fruity cherry bomb of dark sugars strawberry laces morello and clove. The fabulous pot still character ends on a sliver of mint as the fruit gently dulls. (2000 bottles exclusively for The Stillhouse Midleton’s single pot still club) €65"
2526,10,"It’s like Mom’s apple pie in a glass. This whiskey was distilled at Cooley and spent 14 years in bourbon then 2 years extra maturation in an 80 year old Palo Contado sherry cask from Bodegas Emilio Hidalgo. Brown sugar baked apples warmed almonds chocolate jimmies nutmeg vanilla and cardamom. Sherry flavors caress with apple spun sugar candied peel sultanas stone fruits and the fruitiness of Scharffen Berger bars. Gracefully wanes meditating on the red and black fruits. (711 bottles) €250"
2527,10,"Saturated with tropical fruits banana butterscotch barley sweetness marzipan creamed coconut and a fine thread of spice after the 8 month finishing period in dark Caribbean rum casks. This is a huge vehicle for flavor: silky and thick mouthfeel with sweet citrus honey mango guava passion fruit Seville orange and a sting of bitterness to keep your taste buds on their toes. Spice is merely a bit-part player."
2528,4,"Whoosh! Jack Teeling’s first golden arrow is this weird and wacky whiskey. Have you ever heard Jane's Addiction? This is to conventional whiskey what that band was to conventional rock. Finished in Sauternes casks it's like nothing you've tasted from Ireland. All the Irish characteristics are there but they're bent and twisted and put together in a new and exhilarating order. I wasn't sure at first. Now I'm begging for a refill just to make sure it all really happened."
2529,10,"Whiskeys made from 100% Irish barley are not abundant so at sweet sixteen there is much to celebrate about this grown-up version of Tyrconnell. Honey pear crème brûlée clementine peel tinned peach and pencil shavings on the nose. Citrus candied peel lemon and grapefruit mingle among the sweetness but it’s anchored by layered spices and rounds out with a finish of juicy spiced oranges and peach. Moreish and delicious."
2530,10,"A small-batch collaboration with London’s Umbrella Brewing the nose is like a hot toddy with baked lemon honey lemongrass chopped chives and ginger beer (not ginger) notes. This next-gen finishing experiment really works; ginger beer is again apparent on the palate with honey lemon creaminess then crystallized ginger and caramelized citrus slices. Zippy refreshing and tasty: Teeling just upped its game again. €50"
2531,4,"Kilbeggan once overshadowed by its stable-mates is the rising star in the Cooley repertoire; an active distillery once more and capable of thoroughbred gems like this. This isn’t your typical Irish whiskey at all so be warned. Sure there are lashings of soft caramel peach crumble and vanilla up front but then the wood takes over and big waves of tannin and chili pepper kick in. It’s 40% ABV but it delivers a much harder punch. Limited edition release."
2532,9,"A blend of three different types of whiskey -- malt whiskey grain whiskey and a third component which is said to be a malt whiskey produced from crystal malt. Brewers and homebrewers know crystal malt well a slightly caramelized version of malted barley. Its rich texture suggests a decent malt content for a blend. Layers of sweetness (honeyed vanilla rummy molasses toasted marshmallow) are balanced by toasted nuts dried fruit and dark chocolate. Very dynamic and with plenty of grit. Smartly bottled at 46%."
2533,10,"Like an old confectionery shop with fruit Life Savers marshmallow pear drops coconut oil and cherry notes. Ideal for those with a sweet tooth it doles out tangy citrus lemon peel strawberry bubble gum then evens out with a creamier mouthfeel and more red fruits; red currant and cranberry. Tangy and moreish once you weather the sugar rush concluding with a lengthy finish of ripe fruits after a spicy flare."
2534,9,"One of Cooley’s finest efforts. Moderate doses of kiln smoke dried turf and kippers tamed by vanilla cream barley and a buttery olive oil texture. Subtle spices dance on the palate. Lingering smoky white pepper finish. Islay meets Ireland."
2535,10,"The bright sunny welcome of the rum cask greets you as you raise the glass to your nose. Honeycomb golden syrup fresh bread and dry powdered-spice aromas. The satin smooth palate boasts sweet melon and honey developing caramel and orange oils with a tail that turns slightly nutty. Worth a comparative tasting against Teeling Small Batch this is an Irish whiskey to take you through the summer."
2536,10,"An attractive proposition of granola toasted nuts dried fruits vanilla pod grist box and wood spices greets the nose. It’s light bodied but tasty with nutty flavors initially whole almond and nougat then walnut as orange peel flavors blossom into marmalade on hot buttered toast with baked muffin and cinnamon while the spices rip along under the tongue. Warm fruitcake on the finish."
2537,4,"Bright sparks these Jameson guys. This takes all the worldwide quality and balance of the standard bottle and adds a large dollop of pot still whiskey providing plummy rich fruits to the mix. They may have also upped the effects of oak too so there's an extra depth to the whiskey. Fans of the brand will love it and pot still whiskey fans will appreciate an affordable full-flavored blend. (Value Pick)"
2538,10,"Virgin Irish oak-finished Midleton single pot still whiskeys aged from 15 to 22 years take pot still into exciting new territory. The native pot still spiciness is enveloped by chocolate-covered honeycomb toasty oak spotty bananas and a barista’s coffee scoop though a dash of water picks out lemongrass and rubbed mint. A silky smooth mouthfeel of succulent fruits is shaken down with cocoa powder. Black currant squares up as heavy pot incarnate. Clove-spiked stewed apple weighs into a lengthy finish."
2539,4,"Very limited and therefore at the top end of the price range. Distiller Alex Chasko says that every time he tastes it he's taken back in time to R.E.M.'s “Green” tour so what's not to love? Dried apple dustiness gives way to pineapple melon and kiwifruit. It's all very sweet until late on when spice cuts in."
2540,10,"Despite the vintage statement this is 13 year old single pot still matured in first-fill bourbon. Apparently it was MIA for eight years before being bottled. Peeled apples crackerbread Quaker oats ripening pears cappuccino sprinkles and lightly toasted spices make for a well-composed and inviting prospect. Enveloping and oily with tarte aux pommes fruit polos allspice and ground ginger. After a brief effervescent fizzle it expands to become creamier and the spices carry on long after you have swallowed. €350"
2541,10,"Sourcing Pedro Ximénez casks used since 1918 at a bodega in Jerez Teeling left this
whiskey to finish for 3 years. A bouquet of sweet red apple black grape dried fruits
and blueberry with sweet roasted cashews dry spices and a slight herbal edge. Blue
fruits plum cinnamon and bitter chocolate are harried ferociously by spicy
peppercorn leaving a finish of bruised orchard fruit. Add water and the fruit really
shines. (10000 bottles) €95"
2542,10,"Pot still rye whiskey containing 30% rye with malted and unmalted barley and the only Kilbeggan distilled entirely on-site. This has a nose of Japanese rice crackers fennel seeds cracker bread cinnamon and nutmeg. A light structure of creamy pear ginger loaf clotted cream toffee and vanilla before a peppery blast leads into the toasty rye flavors with a finish of glittering spice and malty bread notes."
2543,10,"Here’s a perfect example of a bourbon-matured whiskey lit up by a sherry finish; you can sense the toffee aromas swathed in dark sherry yielding flavors of raisin and fig. A beautiful velvety texture with flavors of cherry dark orange rich notes of chocolate-dipped dark berries toffee sweetness and wood spices. When a bitter note creeps in swallow and enjoy the short finish of currants and mixed peel."
2544,10,"The golden sweetness of the wine cask is apparent with light floral notes baked almonds warm flapjacks and golden syrup. Initially it lands light as a feather introducing melon and green apple becoming textured with cinnamon spices and nutmeg and swirling with caramelized sugar sweetness. Complex with fruit sourness and gooseberry notes adding depth to the flavor progression leading to a dry and pure finish. Water adds sugariness: it’s preferable in its full-strength fighting Irish guise. (K&L Wines only 380 bottles)"
2545,10,"This is a 70/30 blend of aged single malt whiskey and single pot still whiskey (though no grain whiskey) matured in bourbon barrels for around 7 to 9 years. Revel in the spicy aromas of clove cinnamon and star anise balanced with green apple blossom honey and dry oily vanilla pods. The mouthfeel is weighty and dense from the pot still yet rich in honey spice and vanilla with a tongue-enveloping finish of custard cream biscuits."
2546,10,"Warmed honey oozing over toasted English muffins with dry spices and a twist of clementine peel. There’s a cool clean freshness too. A satiny texture with an immediate wave of flavor engulfs the tongue; a big hit of citrus peel not fruit is joined by vanilla softness and a hint of nuttiness. This citrus turns delectably tangy and hangs in there no matter how diluted it becomes. The tanginess persists into the long lush warming finish."
2547,10,"Part of a series of innovative wine finishes marking the revival of distilling in Dublin. The fourth release spent a year finishing in sweet aromatic Muscat casks imparting the bouquet of a rose garden with ripe peach satsuma peel peppercorn and black cardamom. Syrupy sweet wine notes canned peach slices vanilla cream ginger root and pepper make this attractive and unique among Irish whiskeys. (12500 bottles) €120"
2548,10,"Cinnamon dusty cocoa rich toffee and sultana on the nose. The mouthfeel is leaner with more cocoa and savory ham notes sweet popcorn cinnamon and thin slivers of chocolate all shot through with sweet stewed fruits. Water brings out a soft chocolate brownie before a lengthy finish."
2549,10,"The oldest official Connemara expression from Beam Suntory delivers the peat sublimely judiciously balanced with estery notes of half-time oranges and pineapple rings and an inescapable note of nail polish remover. It’s bright beautiful whiskey rich with piquant orange and dark vanilla smooth and packed with flavor which softens to fresh cream and spiced toffee. Ebbs away with dignity trailing creaminess and intense fruit in its wake. €178"
2550,10,"After 21 years in refill sherry this whiskey was finished for 4 months in their preferred Mallorcan Ànima Negra barrels. Here they achieve a sublime marriage of the sherry cask and finishing vessel perfecting the aromas of fresh-sliced fig sherry trifle and crystalized pineapple. Tight and dense flavor offering spangles apricot jam fragrant spices raspberry toffee and maraschino cherry. Real quality and depth of character lasting through to the long fruity finish of dates and stewed fruits. (328 bottles) €195"
2551,4,"The first conventional release from this fledgling company. Irish whiskey's equivalent to a seemingly frothy sweet pop song which on closer inspection has barbed and cutting lyrics. It's a sweet Irish blend and seems like it. But it has a high malt content is packed with flavor and it easily justifies its price. It's creamy and rich with toffee notes there's some tropical fruit and delicious rum-and-raisin milk chocolate. Not too cloying despite the sweetness either."
2552,4,"Meaning ‘the island of the small boar’ Inish Turk Beg is an island off the coast of Ireland. Its latest launch is a super premium whiskey and it’s lovely. It’s 10 year old Cooley malt matured in casks that previously contained Irish poteen matured on the island and brought down to bottling strength with island rainwater. The result is a rich green and yellow fruit melee punctuated with zippy spices and zingy wood notes. Expensive but very lovable."
2553,4,"Bog oak is oak preserved in Irish peat bogs for 5000 years and for this whiskey cask heads made of it are used for maturation. The whiskey is 3 year old Turf Mor only a year older then mixed with some older whiskeys and it's intriguing. This has all the oily burning dust smoky notes of a standard Connemara but the rubbery youthfulness of Turf Mor is gone and this is sweet with orange notes and a long peaty sweet finish. € 250"
2554,10,"After 18 years maturing in traditional oak this triple distilled whiskey undergoes a four-cask finish in bourbon oloroso sherry port and madeira casks. Following a 6 month period of finishing molasses raisins chocolate ganache malt loaf and solid oak notes have emerged after careful blending of the component whiskeys. Smooth yet thick and mouth-drawing; black fruits treacle wrinkled vanilla pods chocolate chip muffins and sticky dates. There are less than 2500 bottles of this attractive resinous whiskey that slips away leaving sweetness dark fruit and cinnamon. €110"
2555,10,"A 23 year old single malt from 1991 finished in French oak Ànima Negra casks from Mallorca producing a dark ruby colored whiskey. Rich and earthy: raisins treacle strawberry Jell-O sawdust on dunnage floors gingerbread and traces of peppermint. Early creaminess is swept aside by intensely fruity waves of blackberry blueberry strawberry grapefruit and Seville orange that draw the mouth. Sweet Jaffa cake centers emerge later. Soft never boisterous and finishes with dry heat and fig paste (334 bottles). €325"
2556,10,"Connemara’s wild west coast landscape is a world away from this peated whiskey’s production at Cooley Distillery on Ireland’s east coast. Greater smoke than Original; lemon and fresh cream translate into lemon lozenges and sherbet with tangy tropical fruits and well-balanced smoke lasting throughout the finish."
2557,10,"Three is the magic number: bourbon oloroso and canteiro-seasoned madeira barrels bring forth an intense whiskey that radiates summer warmth with unctuous raisin sweetness candied orange peel honey ground cumin peppercorn and toasted oak. Peppercorn and oak char follow fruity-sweet flavors of apple cranberry cherry and sultana. This impressive grain whiskey is more assertively spicy than their malts but displays even greater depth and character than Glendalough Double Barrel. €48"
2558,9,"The fruitiest of the three. Notes of ripe fruit candied almonds treacle and toffee. Dry spicy oak notes on the finish. Rich and thick in texture but not to the point of being cloying. And while the sherry notes are prominent throughout they do not dominate like many other Scotch and Irish whiskeys. It’s well balanced and very enjoyable. Save this one for after dinner."
2559,9,"An interesting alternative to a traditional Irish whiskey (kind of reminds me of the rum-casked Springbanks and the Glenfiddich Havana Reserve). Flavors of toffee light molasses and caramelized sugar throughout with a hint of lime and spice. Chewy in texture too. There’s a nice interplay between the sweet rum notes and the dry oak spices with the oak emerging the victor on the finish."
2560,10,"Fresh and approachable with lemon curd green apples almond and caramelized brown sugar. Sweet lemon and honey icing sugar and little twists of orange peel then as it relaxes nougat nuttiness Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal flavors and more creaminess. The finish keeps a grip on the front of the mouth. This sip of Tipp will do me just fine until the family-run distillery is built at Ballindoney Farm."
2561,9,"Named for the distillery of the same name and where many other well-know Irish blends are produced (including Jameson Powers Paddy and Tullamore Dew). This is the distillery’s ultra-premium blend offering. The whiskey is somewhat shy and bashful in personality (when compared to its pure pot still siblings like Redbreast and the quite rare Jameson 15 year old) and really takes some patience to appreciate its subtle beauty. Sweet notes of honeyed malt and vanilla up front with a hint of marshmallow and summer fruits. The palate eventually dries out nicely and deepens evolving into a medley of subtle spice. Very drinkable."
2562,4,"This marks the biggest identity change since Clark Kent morphed into Superman; the plodding Paddy brand has been reshaped for this limited edition into a young and feisty pot still whiskey. It's meant to recreate the taste of 100 years past which begs the question: what happened? This has raspberry violet and pear but there's a mysterious stranger at the heart a pepper and oily center: a bit like a gypsy in a wedding dress. But it scrubs up well. €75"
2563,9,"Connemara is the peated Irish whiskey from the Cooley distillery and this one is their (and Ireland’s) smokiest offering yet. This is the first time I ever detected dung (albeit subtly) in a whiskey — and only on the nose thankfully. It’s curiously intriguing. The style of peat used along with the youth of this whiskey has a distinct impact of the whiskey’s flavor. It’s sweet and smoky which works well. Throw in some bacon fat diesel oil smoke (like at a boat dock) anise ginger honeyed malt barley lime and pear. Underneath all that peat lies what seems like a fairly young whiskey because it is very brisk and vibrant but not excessively so. Bonus points for distinctiveness."
2564,10,"Powerfully smoky this one. Driftwood bonfires with a distinctive salinity to the smoke. Neglected fruit bowls. The tannins and red wine influences of cherry apple peach and mango attempt to match the intensity of the burning engine of peat. Sooty embers diminish leaving cherry-studded fudge to finish. Wonderful design touches inspired by the Book of Kells on this peated single malt from Cooley finished in red wine casks from Ànima Negra. (349 bottles) €250"
2565,4,"The Wild Geese whiskeys offer much but seem to lack the conviction to strike out and be bold. Ironically though this is the one you'd expect to play safest of all in fact it's the most interesting of the bunch. There are trademark apple notes but it flip-flops appealingly. It has a creamy and toffee-ish heart is full soft and sweet and has some orange fruit apricot and peach notes. Not unlike a classy Canadian whisky."
2566,10,"Following a 6 month period of finishing in the same four cask types as its older sibling (see above) we get a fruity nose of cherry lips black currant juice brambles Cox’s orange pippin taffy candy and the citrus acidity of oils squeezed from the peel. Oh it’s sweet syrupy and spicy; a fruity cocktail of apple and strawberry. Diminishing spice and bright rustic apples usher in a rewarding finish. A complex and distinctive recipe for sure. €70"
2567,10,"Following bourbon cask maturation this spent a further 4 years in red wine casks from Domaine Des Anges. It has a gentle coastal brininess of smoked eel with apple relish seashells lemongrass with beet root and black fruits. This is a real chewer; toffee bars raisin juiced apples and raspberry. The smokiness builds powerfully and unrelentingly. After a final catch of smoke the finish has lush mint toffees. A mighty peaty Irish whiskey from you know where. (351 bottles) €150"
2568,10,"This dark ruby colored dram rouses the senses with its nose of poached pears raspberry coulis cherry blossom marshmallow menthol and chocolate-dipped cherry. It has a rich throbbing fruitiness in an oily slick texture backed by cola cubes Tunes lozenges and cherryade. It peters out leaving the palate numbed with faded fruit juiciness. Distilled back in 1991 and matured in refill bourbon cask #8585 this is special occasion stuff. (134 bottles) £134"
2569,10,"A new multi-vintage core expression of independent Irish single malt compiled from a vatting of whiskey finished variously in port sherry white burgundy cabernet sauvignon and Madeira. The nose suggests honey baked lemons ground almonds desiccated coconut white pepper and soft toffee. A fabulously thick texture; thank goodness for their insistence on non-chill filtering. It’s fruity with twinkling spice pepper root ginger and vanilla orbiting around a fudge-like core. The oak is present on the dry finish."
2570,10,"Exudes beautiful soft peat notes barley sugar and apple-cinnamon granola. Light lemon and honey with a delightful growth in apple crumble flavors golden syrup and more peat smoke and orchard fruits on the finish. Drink this neat."
2571,4,"Like the Writers Tears reviewed in this issue this is from an independent company linked to renowned whiskey maker Bernard Walsh. It is described as of a style popular in James Joyce's Dublin (hence the name). Grain whiskey was a no-no at that time so this uses no grain and is a mix of malt and pot still whiskeys. For its price and strength it is amazing — a big-hearted and full-flavored whiskey with an oily apple-y pot still heart and cinnamon nutmeg and pepper spices. €38"
2572,10,"This promises to be a bumper year for older Irish whiskey. This example from Cooley distillery is a 1991 distillation matured in bourbon casks then finished in a Sauternes cask.Temptations exude from the glass with apricot frangipane whole almond and cloved orange. After a vinous opening it evolves through a complex palate of white chocolate honey cocktail grapefruit and dried banana chips. Plum skin and cinnamon spice seem in conflict with the sweetness and somewhat disturb the harmony. £130"
2573,10,"The Boutique-y incursion into Irish whiskey leads with this splendid vintage. Rejoice in this fresh clean nose with sweet barley lemon zest lime pith vanilla frosting and early summer florals cut with a slight saltiness. This flavorsome whiskey has thick juicy oils and progresses from an early citrus dominance to reveal ginger pepper and ground almond. Water magnifies the citrus to great effect. £125"
2574,10,"Bonfire smoke sea salt caramel and plain chocolate with a dry minerality and a reassuring dusty garden shed aroma. Chocolate and ripe fruit on the palate with pears some tart acidity candied jellies then damsons sultanas cocoa and cinnamon. The creamy mouthfeel slides into Bourneville plain chocolate. The peatiness is well integrated supporting the alignment of flavors: the smoke outlasts the fading chocolate-cinnamon finish. Best neat as water blunts the precision and enjoyable sharp edges. £67"
2575,10,"Connacht Whiskey Co. finished 4 year old grain whiskey in port barrels for 3 to 6 months in this new and improved recipe. Cherry soda rose hip lemon zest vanilla frosting and dry grass aromas with a taste of damson cherry redcurrant jelly pepper and a good lift of sugary sweetness. A potpourri of spices bubbles up in the aftertaste amid lingering trails of fruity sweetness."
2576,10,"Bernard Walsh hand selects the 12 year old whiskey for this bottling using only first-fill bourbon casks. The rich tawny color has a nose of caramelizing sugars gingersnaps peanut brittle and stewed fruits of apple and rhubarb. Rich flavors of butterscotch caramels orange twist oak and that ginger intensity which persists with a slight bitterness. There’s a big hit of grapefruit as it reaches its zenith before it mellows to a dry nutty conclusion. (2200 bottles to be released annually)"
2577,10,"The most northerly of Northern Ireland’s distilleries Bushmills ages this spirit in bourbon and oloroso casks before finishing in port wine casks. The sweet notes of fat ripe blueberries plum flesh and dusty dry warehouses sketch out the nose. It lands on the tongue dry but piquant then the fruit swarms all over it; blueberry black currant and apple with hazelnut chocolate pralines black pepper and spice. This was once the pick of the range but the port influence seems feistier than older bottlings and I miss how smooth this used to taste."
2578,9,"Tropical in nature with pineapple coconut and kiwi. Additional notes of vanilla caramel new-mown hay and light marzipan. Creamy on the palate throughout. A lovely whiskey but the two finished versions above have it beat."
2579,10,"The Connacht Whiskey Company’s first release comes in small bottles but it goes a long way. Whole lemons yellow plum pine floor cleaner and a light smear of vanilla. Neat there’s a real intensity of lemon-drenched sweet oak with a boiled candy finish but it’s much more enjoyable brought down in strength. The soft fruits shine; it’s lemony though less acidic and the barley notes show their best side. One of the tastiest sourced whiskeys on the Irish market. (5000 bottles) Price is per 375 ml."
2580,10,"The nose on the single malt is spicier than their blend with salted caramels and a smear of honey to boot. Key to the palate is the fresh fruitiness: melon pear and white grape. Additionally there’s honey a hefty malt presence and spices keep things interesting. The finish of bruised fruit makes a greater impression at the back of the palate. Water emphasizes sweetness and blushing summer fruits. Great quality though it doesn’t shout it from the rooftops."
2581,10,"The single grain category gains another brother. This was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels finished in Spanish oloroso sherry wood before being reduced with Wicklow mountain water. The nose oozes caramel browned apple grated nutmeg black peppercorn toasted coriander and clove. A flash of mint is overtaken by a swath of caramel apple and pear drops orbiting the muscular spice kick of clove pepper and ground chili concentrated on the tongue. Kapow! One to pour blind to Talisker lovers."
2582,10,"200 years ago Kinahan’s was the favorite tipple of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The small batch single malt has blackcurrant jellies cinnamon sticks dry oak spices and baked raisins on the nose. An unctuous succulent palate follows with rich baked goods roasted fruits baked orange cherry cola black pepper and chili flakes. Rounded weighty sweet and rolling this just laps up the water. Dark oily finish with bitter chocolate. A single malt you can really get behind."
2583,4,"Cooley produced some great Irish single malt whiskeys and this is no slouch either. It pulls off the trick of being both very Irish with sweet lush pear fermenting apple and yellow fruit notes; and of being distinctively a single malt mainly because the barley is held in check by just enough influence of tannin and spice. It's a bit like a fruit cordial and the oak doesn't overstay its welcome. A nice pepper flourish in the finish."
2584,4,"Grandiose name for a perfectly acceptable but ultimately tame and straight-ahead Irish whiskey. There are hints of pot still oiliness and the expected green fruits are in place. But the only new trick on offer here is the fact that it is less sweet and cloying than its brand siblings the apples are like baked apples filled with mincemeat with nutmeg and cinnamon in the mix. Frustrating in that it hints at greatness but doesn't follow through."
2585,10,"The Walsh Family releases 6000 bottles in every small batch of their single malt. Each bottling is a combination of triple distilled whiskey matured in oloroso sherry and bourbon casks. The nose is bright with vanilla icing butterscotch and dried peach. The taste is quite active with honey cinnamon gingerbread ground almond and dark chocolate. There is a brief flat spot where the bitterness burns through before it fades to leave a pleasing tickle around the gums."
2586,10,"Fresh and grassy it’s quite dainty with peach Liquorice Allsorts and light florals. Sugary sweetness lemon slices and candied orange jellies concluding with hot white pepper and residual sweetness. This is sourced 4 year old grain whiskey finished in port barrels though the label does not disclose this. Otherwise an original delectable finishing concept. (DE IL MA MD NJ NY PA and Washington D.C.)"
2587,10,"The oldest release yet under the Glendalough name this bourbon cask whiskey brings forth a nose of lush caramels malt milky hot chocolate nutmeg with herbal notes hovering at the periphery. The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and reassuringly malty. After an early spice kick there is grapefruit with mint eventually taking charge. Fizzy effervescent candies pop on the palate and tongue. A medium-length finish the mint diminishing to leave cinnamon and a little charred oak. A fine discovery."
2588,10,"The Ryan family has been running the Beggars Bush pub in Dublin since 1913 and historically they bottled their own whiskey. This is enticingly sweet from the bourbon wood with taffy candy vanilla cream and peeled orange. The warm fruity flavors encompass sweet orange lime and pineapple before a wave of honey and maltiness rides in with an undercurrent of Kendal mint cake though the fruit persists. Satellites of citrus around drying oak make the finish. Solid composed and decent."
2589,9,"A peat-smoked malt whiskey from Ireland’s Cooley distillery similar to many smoky Scotch whiskies. The difference to me is that I don’t get as much of the seaweed and coastal notes often found in the Scotch whiskies. Still there is plenty going on in this whisky including a lovely creamy vanilla and honeyed malt underbelly to tame the smoke. It reveals more of itself with the addition of water. If there were peat-smoked Lowland Scotch whiskies they might taste like this."
2590,10,"To stand out in the increasingly crowded marketplace of sourced single malt Irish whiskey you need a good original hook: this whisky is cut with Wicklow water. Shhh! Don’t tell St. Kevin. The bourbon casks have developed a sweet honeyed nose with fresh hay peach pit and some mature oak characteristics. Lighter weight than the blend (see below) it relinquishes golden honey satsuma ground ginger crystal sugar and tame spices. Pleasantly drinkable and incontestably well-made but the liquid needs greater individuality."
2591,4,"The Teelings were responsible for giving us the quite wonderful Greenore which moved up the gears until it hit stunning at 15 years old. This I suspect is back to the start and is a work in progress. But it has all the right parts even if it isn't firing quite yet. Its nose is industrial and a tad sappy but the taste makes up for it: sweet light with smoky ashtrays and almond pulp."
2592,4,"If you've ever tasted Connemara peated whiskey you'll recognize this. As you'd expect for an Irish whiskey it's sweet with overripe apples and some pureed almost creamy pear. But that's all offset by a sooty burned-dust smokiness and some gentle spice. It's quite soft and easy-drinking and the taste is never less than interesting. But these days it's up against some stiff competition."
2593,4,"Don’t remember ever reading that Michael Collins suffered from schizophrenia… This is a bewildering whiskey suffering from an identity crisis; its fruity apple Irish heart wrapped in wood some peat and conversely some sherbet and sugar-coated almonds. It’s not unpleasant — far from it — but the journey from sweet apple to sharp spice is a challenge. Stay with it and ultimately the complexities of the malt win through."
2610,10,"The cognac-cask finish finesses the intensity and concentration of the lush fruity character of this whisky. A complex interplay of peach apricot apple pineapple lemon zest thick-cut marmalade oak faint spices and dried fruit on the nose. A thick velvety mouthfeel of sweet orange grapefruit and lime sweeps to a climax of peppercorn and clove then it abates with dried apricot papaya and marzipan-wrapped Battenberg cake. Exceptional! (800 bottles) Collectibles"
2594,10,"This first release in the Steamship Collection was matured in oloroso sherry butts and enticingly smells both oily and jammy. Dried fruits such as cranberry cherry and raisin with Brazil nut oil wood spice and light pepper. A soft dram tasting of stewed apple plum cherry jelly spiced orange dark chocolate and ending with spices pepper fading fruit and carob nibs. It’s not all at sea but just needs more body especially mid-palate to ride the waves of oloroso influence. (Travel Retail exclusive) £65"
2595,10,"Just 6 months in a port pipe have dressed this whiskey with aromas of Kola Kubes savory spices and meat juices plus the whiff of a damp dog licking your face. Palate of cherry lips golden delicious apple and a peppery bite it careens toward plum bitter fruit skins and a medicinal ending of aniseed-laced cough syrup. Like young vintage port this still has more than a few sharp edges."
2596,10,"Prune juice and some fresh cream on the nose. The sticky palate delivers flavors of apple juice tangerine and gooseberry. The spices get popping growing peppery but despite the ripe fruits it could benefit from more sweetness. The long spicy finish is redolent of aniseed throat lozenges. It would have been fascinating to taste the unfinished whiskey or a version after a longer sherry finish."
2597,12,"A light and reticent nose with scant aromas of grain vanilla marmalade rose water and honeysuckle. The palate is grain-driven and sharp with ethanol along with Popsicle stick vanilla and almond shells. A woody and rather sharp finish underscores the immaturity of this whiskey which needs time to soften its youth and rough edges."
2598,10,"Glendalough’s hook is the Wicklow water used to cut this whiskey. Sweet fruits tubby satsumas lime and passion fruit backed by ground ginger star anise and some earthy background notes from the bourbon casks. Tangy orange crystallized fruits predominate pierced with pepper root ginger and soda pop. The mouthfeel is light and uncomplicated but provides a solid delivery of tasty flavors from start to the snappy spicy finish. A great introduction."
2599,10,"A 14 year old unpeated single malt whiskey given The Celtic Whiskey Shop’s trademark Ànima Negra red wine finish for 3 years. The nose has whiffs of fruit gums and honey-drizzled baked plums. A well-defined fruity attack on the palate of strawberry bubblegum and orange peel sucks in the cheeks but collides with spices maltiness and gentle caramels. A spicy burst ushers in cola flavors for a lengthy finish with a touch of mint showing up late for the party. €125"
2600,10,"First impression is of molten Reese’s peanut butter cups. This 13 year old single grain whiskey has been finished in second-fill red wine casks from Ànima Negra in Mallorca however this wine cask has given the whiskey a kick in the Balearics. The grain character takes a drubbing the nose engulfed by jam pots and loganberry. It is gentle and deliciously fruity reminiscent of strawberry raspberry pop tarts and citrus groves. Black pepper and caramelized sugar to close. (417 bottles) €90"
2601,10,"An aperitif-style aged Irish whiskey which plays in harmony with the fresh American oak bourbon casks. A light fragrant nose of spring blossoms waxed lemons cinnamon sticks pears in golden syrup marshmallows and fresh laundry. There is decent weight and structure here. Sharp acidity of peel scattered over lemon meringue pie cinnamon black pepper and a finish of creamy fudge dipped in milk chocolate. Water pries open a hitherto-hidden waxy consistency (6000 bottles released)"
2602,9,"Light crisp and gently sweet. Notes of vanilla cut hay honey and lemon with a grainy dry bourbon-oak finish. A warm weather whisky or as an aperitif. Perhaps a way to introduce a vodka drinker to whiskey?"
2603,10,"Originating from Cooley distillery this whiskey spent a decade in a first-fill bourbon cask before a period of extra maturation in a Vinhos Barbeito madeira cask and the influence is unmistakable on the nose. Additionally there is vanilla icing brown bananas sprigs of wild mint and a savory note of smoked duck. It’s a soft buttery experience with honey mandarin guava banana and light spices. Dry short sweet finish but the Madeira tips the balance. (377 bottles) €125"
2604,9,"An Irish blend matured in used bourbon barrels and finished in Concannon Petite Sirah wine barrels. Very clean and fresh with mouth-coating honeyed malt vanilla tropical fruit and golden raisin. Fleeting light oak finish. My only issue with this whiskey is that it tastes young. I would like to see another four to five years of aging (in bourbon casks not Sirah) for this whiskey to really develop. (Available only in the U.S.)"
2605,9,"Cooley distillery’s oldest blend to date. Packaged in what looks like a very large perfume bottle. Elegant and creamy on the nose with vanilla coconut grass and suggestions of bourbon. Similar on the palate but more reserved. Becoming dry on the finish with lingering charred oak. I think the slightly austere oaky finish detracts from what otherwise would be a very nice blend. The best part of this whiskey is the nose."
2606,10,"A 10 year old single malt whiskey bottled for Pete St. John by Glendalough musters a low-key olfactory range with reference points of malted barley sawn oak and soft fudge. A woozy haze of toffee buttercream vanilla and clotted cream hang on a light structure. The flavor has limited room to maneuver roaming around a palate of sponge cake fudge fingers and ginger snaps before it putters out with a dry fleeting finish. €60"
2607,10,"As the enterprising fellows at West Cork Distillers only built the place in 2007 this 10 year old must be sourced elsewhere. A decent nose with vanilla cupcakes fresh from the oven dull lemon notes tablet and faint spices. It has a limited range let down by a narrow flavor profile; acidic lemony sharpness with a light mouthfeel. The sharpness strong-arms the sugariness for 30 seconds until toffee notes break through. An acerbic lemon bonbon in liquid form."
2608,4,"It's great that Irish whiskey is thriving and William Grant has bought Tullamore Dew. But they need help. To paraphrase English football fans someone doesn't know what he's doing. The label says this is 12 years old small batch and limited edition. What? The normal whiskey is a blend and there's no distillery. So what is this and why small batch? The whiskey's a mess too — flabby characterless and confused — the whiskey equivalent of a karaoke singer doing Led Zeppelin."
2609,10,"Bushmills’ sumptuous magnum opus spins aromas of sultana brown sugar walnut oil date slice chocolate-covered cranberries leather gloves and a hint of espresso. The dark crepuscular mystique continues in the syrupy mouthfeel redolent of forest honey banana bread nuts browned butter sultana date and blackberry. Utterly beguiling the Madeira finish works wonders here right through to the last moments of the smooth sweet finish. A must-try for all."
2611,10,"Powerfully smoky for 45 years old with charcoal burnt turf smoked venison dark chocolate Brazil-nut dark toffee roasted chestnut and a hint of smoked haddock. Thick golden syrup peppery spice and vanilla caramel; the peat smoke is heavier initially then fades and darts between other flavors. Toasted oak dark sugars cocoa and smoke finish an incredible sip of Irish whiskey liquid history. (48 bottles) Collectible"
2612,10,"A limited-release vatting of triple distilled bourbon cask-matured spirit distilled in 1994 and 1996. This immersive and intense whiskey has waves of honey and fruit sweetness floral and herbal notes melting butter on fruit scones macaroon bar vanilla pod candied grapefruit peel and faint wood spices. Sharp orange kumquat and lime flavors mingle with honey vanilla fudge and barley sugar. Spices peak and retreat ahead of a sweet finish."
2613,10,"Distilled in 1983 the nose emanates lemon peel blooming gorse gooseberry mint imperials butter biscuits sanded oak florist shop salted caramel and violins lying in red velvet cases. Nimble and juicy on the palate it’s an odyssey through lemon lychee and tangy peels with the acidity of gooseberry riffing off caramels before honeydew vanilla and buttery fresh banana mingle in its final throes while it evanesces from the palate.€7000"
2614,10,"Like a delicious bowl of breakfast cereal this has pecan cinnamon and Quaker oats all wonderfully balanced with oak barley vanilla dry spices and drizzled runny honey. Savoring this rare aged Irish whiskey laid down by the legendary Frank McHardy delivers sweet butterscotch vanilla honey toasted cinnamon fresh orange and barley all thickly spread at this strength so it really hits home. What a way to start the day! (1200 bottles)"
2615,10,"Lean green fruits and dry spices with fresh Comice pear honeydew melon lychee toasted sesame cardamom banoffee pie creamy vanilla and delicate perfumed florals. The PX has framed this beautifully with flavors of sultana shortbread apple pear clove and black pepper with the orchard fruits and spices fading into the finish. This has aged gracefully and shows the great potential for long-aged Irish whiskeys. (100 bottles U.S. exclusive)"
2616,10,"Sheer nectar dripping with honeyed delights: baklava maple syrup syropiasta vanilla spun sugar malt wrapped in gentle oak and a notion of Szechuan pepper. The mouthfeel is flowing and silken radiating flavors of golden syrup tangerine peppercorn vanilla light oak and nougat. As the flavor crests the sweetness is evocative of Château D’Yquem. This decadent piece of Irish history originated as a Teeling family cask distilled in 1983. (U.S. exclusive 43 bottles)"
2617,10,"This commendable Irish peated malt has a nose of apple clove bonfire smoke pepper thick butterscotch sauce panna cotta and sweet floral notes. The smoke settles down to a glowing log fire with a fine layer of spice and a twist of citrus peel oils. Sauternes influence cultivates an exemplary combination of sweetness and spice yielding a mouth-drenching combination of red apple tangy orange marmalade peppery spices and brown sugar. (6000 bottles for U.S.)"
2618,10,"Triple distilled and fully matured in bourbon casks this single malt has a sweet soft and inviting nose of crisp green apples vanilla custard and lemon butter biscuits. Soft lemon meringue pie on the palate. Sweeter orange breaks through with a little spice on the fringes then hits its stride with dried fruits and baked apple. A final flourish of spice and candied peel rounds off this excellent whiskey. Value Pick"
2619,10,"The golden-sweet wine finish works like a sunbeam from heaven. The nose basks in summer meadow flowers sweet honey light citrus lemon curd and vanilla. It’s finely structured on the palate with apricot pastries runny honey sugar-coated orange peach cobbler candied peel and the lightest of spices. These Legacy bottlings are pretty special but this beguiling whiskey is really one to fall for. (1000 bottles)"
2620,10,"Like two people talking at once; one telling you about the malt biscuit orange cake and honey the other espousing dark chocolate cookies cocoa powder and black fruits. It’s an articulate dialogue not an argument and they find consensus. Substantial dark chocolate black fruit honey mixed peel roasted peppery spices and praline are a treat for the taste buds. Active spices and bitter chocolate conclude the conversation. (12000 bottles for U.S.)"
2621,10,"Sweet sherry with a heady spring floral intensity lemon honey and graham crackers yet delicate as a dandelion seed in a summer breeze. The palate is seductively sweet with honey effervescent lemon sherbet caramel and spices showing a little more of the wine fruit and hints of citrus. Distinctively different the finish is initially drying then the fruit returns with a grapefruit peel sharpness. Terrifically good dram. (18000 bottles) Editors’ Choice"
2622,10,"Baked plum desserts sweet cherry star anise and dark vanilla on the nose with an enticing freshly toasted spiciness. Caramel plum pomegranate and rawhide shoelaces shift into a concentrated fruitiness as allspice and pepper well up yielding a sweet core of graham crackers marshmallows and creamy vanilla with hints of chocolate. Bruised fruit and throbbing spices characterize the finish on this laudable example of wine finishing. (1020 bottles)"
2623,10,"Aromas of green apples zested lime and caramel entice the senses with hints of banana peel and nuts. Succulent green apple honey and vanilla this has a thick syrupy mouth-drawing palate. Baked pear and peppery spices continue into the finish. This expression feels recognizably part of the Knappogue Castle family yet offers a more sophisticated and progressive take on finishing. (1020 bottles)"
2624,10,"A wonderful balance of red wine and malt notes on this Australian shiraz finish: black currant cooked apple blackberry After Eight mints black tea chocolate praline cherry compote and dark toffee. Malty with soft fruits and strawberry jam flavors then cinnamon blackberry dark toffee clove pepper and oak char with the brighter red summer fruits kept in reserve until the final stages. (9000 bottles)€140"
2625,10,"Beginning with more mature whiskey than Glendalough’s Japanese oak-finished debut which was 13 years old this has all the aromatic hallmarks of mizunara as well as golden pastry cooked peach heather honey light malt baguette and white pepper. A honeyed dram of melon white grape and clementine peel with sparkling spices of black pepper and ginger root. It concludes with notes of gingerbread through to a spicy finish though the sweetness remains a constant. (3000 bottles for U.S.)"
2626,10,"Teeling has cleverly exploited Ireland’s whiskey regulations that specify maturation in wooden casks not just oak to release the first chestnut-cask Irish whiskey in the U.S. Crushed cloves wet rocks mint chocolate vanilla seeds dark roast coffee beans Brazil nut and antique leather on the nose. Partaking unshackles gingerbread treacle clove black coffee black fruits and plain chocolate. Dark gothic whiskey from a shadowy part of the warehouse to devour at midnight. (846 bottles for U.S.)"
2627,10,"Matured in American oak in the private cellar of this Dublin bar this flaunts zested lemons a fine layer of honey orange segments and sanded oak. It’s splendidly floral but reassuringly not perfumed. Sweet smooth caramels oranges spicy pepper and gingerbread though the spices never overstep the mark. Develops with concentrated citrus vanilla fudge and chocolate orange and slips down effortlessly. Soothing relaxing and perfectly matured."
2628,10,"I’ve yet to taste any Hyde whiskey that I haven’t loved and this may be their best yet. A wave of soft sweet caramel and toffee light vanilla fresh apricot zesty citrus rum notes and an agreeable mix of aromatic spices. Buttery soft mouthfeel with butterscotch sweetness banana custard vanilla and gentle spices. Very approachable and dessert-like the spices becoming slightly more assertive than the sweetness on the finish."
2629,10,"Ireland’s technical regulations provide flexibility with the type of wood used for aging hence this seriously aromatic whiskey with piquant citrus lemon fresh ginger root sponge cake apple peel sour cherry and dry spices of pepper cumin and whole nutmeg. Delicious citrus peel rich honey vanilla pod ground ginger banana and grapefruit but no matter how hard it tries it keeps shifting back to the spices. More experiments with these barrels please! (12000 bottles) £74"
2630,10,"This elegant well-balanced Dingle is created from whiskey matured in bourbon sherry and port casks which bring out orange zest cherry gummies vanilla strawberry barley sugar and a good rub of ground aromatic spices on the nose. Baked fruits taffy strawberry raspberry coulis clove and pepper open up leading to shortbread sweetness candied peel and more sherry fruit while perky spices are left to carry through on the finish. (12000 bottles)"
2631,10,"Highly aromatic with allspice ground cinnamon and hints of clove. Behind the spice there is soft vanilla toffee creamed coconut and grapefruit peel. A palate comprised of citrus peel oils toffee red berries sweet barley cinnamon pepper and star anise transition to a greater emphasis on toffee hints of chocolate more maltiness and a little oak. The finish allows the spices to shine. (6000 bottles) Editors’ Choice"
2632,10,"Voluptuous fruity nose of lemon meringue pie Conference pear and fudge with floral top notes balanced by aromatic spices. The flavors are focused around orange pear and lemon infiltrated by caramel and hectored by some abiding spice notes of ginger clove and pepper. Late gains made by honey and nougat at the end. Lemon sherbet and aniseed frame the conclusion. Superb sourced single malt from Boann Distillery."
2633,10,"There is a lot of pride behind this bottle but undoubtedly its best features are the gloriously juicy mouthfeel and generosity of flavor. Orchard fruit creamy vanilla and freshly sliced orange square up to a company of spices: a mix of dried cumin cayenne paprika and black pepper. Heavy and tangy the orange conquers the initial charge of spices with flanking maneuvers from lemon and bitter peels giving close support. (1000 bottles for U.S.)"
2634,10,"Ripe pit fruit especially apricot and peach Quaker oats and comb honey aromas are boosted by aromatic fragrances and sandalwood. Cantaloupe mango and papaya are followed by chocolate and cocoa which pair beautifully with the muted citrus. Fragrant spices really add shape and contribute to a sublime balance with spicy chocolate coffee grounds and menthol to finish. A most impressive leap forward in quality and complexity. (6000 bottles for U.S.)"
2635,10,"Perfect for drinkers with a Goldilocks complex this falls between the lemon-favoring 12 year old and the richer sherry finished 16 year old with a nose of sweet mandarin tropical fruits fruit pastries warm banana muffin barley sugar and forest honey. Bold attention-grabbing flavors of orange honey vanilla dried ginger pepper and jam-slathered pastries with caramel ground almond and a tantalizing zesty grapefruit bitterness toward the end."
2636,10,"This blends bourbon and oloroso cask-matured elements drawn from every style of Irish whiskey. A mouthwatering dram with warm creamy toffee ripening yellow banana wood spices toasted coconut spiced stewed apple and cinnamon sticks. A delicious sip reveals a smooth medley of malt chocolate gentle spices Brazil nut and dried fruit which sidles into a long finish of chocolate-covered raisins and deep resonating spice. No reservations; this is special."
2637,10,"The Pyrenean dessert wine-cask finish brings citrus candy hearts apricot and cooking apple peelings to the nose with hints of aniseed allspice and macadamia nuts. Fizzy orange singed peel fruit tarts and honey initially though it’s pretty feisty with pepper aniseed and allspice. Milk chocolate apple and malt biscuits glide into the finish where the spices fade but the fruit remains juicy and sweet. (1000 bottles)"
2638,10,"Precious few distillers outside of Japan are resourceful and determined enough to lay their hands on virgin mizunara oak to cooper their own finishing puncheons let alone allow you to experience its flavors at such a reasonable price. Stone fruit Quaker oats comb honey and sandalwood aromas are followed by ripe melon and tropical fruit flavors trailed by cocoa. Fragrant spices contribute to a sublime balance with spicy chocolate coffee grounds and menthol to finish. This is a rare gem among Irish whiskeys. Number 18 in the 2018 Top 20"
2639,0,"Most Irish whiskey consumed in the U.S. is blended and Ireland’s single pot still whiskeys enjoy a cult following. However Irish single malts including Tyrconnell 16 year old are often unfairly overshadowed by their Scottish neighbors. This limited-edition whiskey made entirely with Irish barley is double distilled in pot stills like most scotch then aged in bourbon barrels. Tyrconnell is named for a racehorse but this whiskey is slow and steady: it’s soft and gentle yet full-flavored with warming vanilla graham cracker and citrus notes and rounded spice. Though it may not be as brash as some scotch malts this thoroughbred is able to go the distance. Number 16 in the 2017 Top 20"
2640,10,"A great discussion whiskey for a themed tasting this has a comforting nose of vanilla malt barley sugar and creamed-coconut macaroons with hints of nutmeg and grated chocolate. The palate brings fruity satsuma barley sugar and an explosion of pepper ginger and licorice. The tangy citrus subsides replaced by ground almond and stewed rhubarb. Dry heat and hot pepper finish that makes you feel like you could breathe fire. (Cask no. 504; 278 bottles)"
2641,10,"Bright citrus zested lime grapefruit peel crystalized fruits malted biscuits and oak overlaid with dry spice notes of nutmeg and cinnamon bark. A creamy malty palate yields to an initial spicy base layer. When the spices step aside there is dried orange fudge sweetness and chocolate orange. Tangy concentrated orange with spices fraying from the edges completes the finish."
2642,10,"On the nose there are warm grassy tones wrapped in a blanket of sherry apple and sultanas with a tickle of fine white pepper lemongrass scented balms and poppy seed cake. In the mouth there is apple cherry and honey nougat backed by richer sherry fruits. The flavor develops steadily with late additions of pepper coinciding with a confluence of sweetness and sherry notes. Baked apple sweetness on the finish."
2643,10,"Lemon and lime grapefruit peel fondant and pine needles with the softness of marshmallows and musty spices. Lemon peel zested lime pear honey and vanilla flavors with gentle spice supporting the citrus and stubborn black pepper growing in confidence to play a greater role. Mouthfeel is silky and light becoming creamy. The finish buzzes with spices and hints of baked citrus. €60"
2644,10,"This noses of crumbly shortbread vanilla caramel orange peels summer blooms walnut and earthy whole spices but it’s more reserved than their 12 year old. It glides through orange spun sugar almond paste a slow burn of spices butterscotch and vanilla before more sherry fruit comes through. Peppercorn and dark berry mark the finish of this graceful mellow and subdued limited-release triple-distilled whiskey."
2645,10,"The Twin Wood release is the result of refilling this triple distilled single malt from its bourbon casks into oloroso casks for a 21-month finishing period. This produced a wonderfully dry nose of macadamia nut pepper and baked apple crumble. Rich sweetness more sherry fruit and raspberry which develop with plum notes some bitter fruits old chocolate and a little heat. Fruity sweetness is maintained through the finish."
2646,10,"This is just a delight; a real flavor giver. A wave of honey sweeps along aromas of creamy vanilla white peach fresh citrus peel white pepper cinnamon stick and milk chocolate. It starts delicately with melon light grape and vanilla swells with citrus acidity and creamy caramel ramping up to toffee darker fruits chocolate Fruit Pastilles and a little oak. The finish is mouth-clinging with vanilla and spice."
2647,10,"The Cooney family opened the Boann Distillery in Ireland’s Boyne Valley in 2016. A little maturity and oloroso finishing fills this whiskey with a more sophisticated air bringing red fruits pecan cookies orange apple pear and some dry peppery spices. The palate has good weight and a lovely balance; caramel sweetness orange crystalized pineapple butterscotch and pepper with a hint of bitter lemon on the finish."
2648,10,"Vanilla buttercream honey sweet oak granola and toasted spice with a pinch of pepper demonstrate the beauty of bourbon-cask maturation for Irish single malt. This is sweet silky and carefree with citrus honey oat cereal and black pepper. The spices grip the tongue yielding to flavors of crystallized pineapple and grapefruit in the latter stages. Lemon orange and spices on a long satisfying finish. Straight-forward darn good whiskey. (1803 bottles)"
2649,10,"In one of the year’s most intriguing experimental techniques Glengarriff treats new barrels with burning peat to imbue a fine veneer of smoke over the surface of the vessel’s virgin oak staves. A final finishing in these smoked barrels imparts the captivating pleasure of chocolate brownie campfire smoke and sweet cocoa aromas that yield to a pleasantly oily rounded whiskey with citrus Jolly Rancher hard candy chocolate cake spices and coffee notes with a finish of festive spices. Ambitious work fresh from the frontiers of flavor. Number 19 in the 2018 Top 20"
2650,10,"Clean and fresh aromas of raspberry jam and vanilla cream spread thickly on warm scones speckled with fragrant spices of pepper and grated nutmeg. An instant spicy kick is followed by a flood of warm fruitiness in the mouth then baked goods and dried citrus. Pepperiness spreads across the tongue growing dominant over flavors of runny caramel and dried fruits. The finish is slightly drying spicy and peppery with good length. (1020 bottles)"
2651,10,"Despite some inconsistent spelling of sherry terms on the exterior tube Dingle is releasing some very good initial whiskeys. The nose brings dates dried apricot and apple haystacks vanilla unwaxed lemon and cardamom pod. This second small batch release tastes fruity with orange lollipops a beautifully developed apricot note and caramel leading to a peak of gingerbread and pepper followed by vanilla toffee and orange oil twisted from the peel. (6000 bottles) €65"
2652,10,"Distinctive for its classic three-wood maturation profile this has complex layers of dark fruits to unravel on the nose: Dried cranberry and blackberry mingle with walnut and black pepper. It’s a satisfyingly smooth and spicy number amid the flavorsome tussle of port and sherry elements in the mouth. Damson and other plums occupy the mid-palate; it’s enjoyably nutty and soaked in delicious portwood flavors."
2653,10,"Taking a leaf from other successful virgin Irish oak finishes Glendalough is the first to deploy this powerful tool on aged Irish single malt. Dark gold with complex aromas: treacle toffee apple walnut shells new leather boots hints of blackcurrant bramble prune whole spices and roasted meat juices. Sour plum 100% cacao peppercorn cassis and slight bitter tannic notes becoming liqueur-like with dark toffee and roasted nuts. (750 bottles for U.S.)"
2654,10,"Spicier and darker than their blend this delivers heather honey banana peel cashew pepper ground coriander and bay leaf. Quite light-bodied and delicate to begin with but the Cognac cask adds fruitiness and greater complexity. Sugary sweet with tingly spices honey cracked black pepper clove-studded oranges and tangy marmalade. A finish of bitter orange pepper and fondant cream makes this a worthy addition to the Cognac cask revival."
2655,10,"An innovative approach to flavoring casks by charring the staves with burning peat this whiskey develops a smoldering nose of dark chocolate brownies dry wood smoke and cocoa sweetness. The impact of the peat is confined to the nose but it tastes pleasantly oily with tangy citrus Jolly Rancher hard candy chocolate cake spices fizzy candies and coffee notes. The finish of nutmeg cinnamon clove and dried peel rounds off an extremely tasty whiskey. (4800 bottles)"
2656,10,"Sweet honey daubed on ripe plums an abundance of barley notes black cherry and a smattering of exotic spices. Juicy notes of cherry plum peach and strawberry with undertones of peppery spice. The flavor fills out with lovely malty notes Quaker Oats and vanilla. The port cask has really complemented the Bushmills character and this second edition in the Steamship collection is the best in the series to date. (£99; Global Travel Retail only)"
2657,9,"The latest limited release from this brand. This whiskey spent most of its life aging in a bourbon barrel and then spent 9 months in sherry casks. (“Twin wood” is synonymous with “finishing.”) This one’s triple distilled (think Bushmills distillery) and is the first Knappogue Castle to be aged in two types of wood. It’s a very nice whiskey with an array of bright fruit lying on a bed of creamy vanilla toasted nuts marshmallow marzipan and powdered cocoa. Excluding the original 1951 Knappogue Castle release (from the long gone B. Daly distillery) this is my favorite of the “modern day” Knappogue Castle whiskeys."
2658,10,"Repackaged at a higher strength the nose is grassy with lemon zest hints of apple and pear vanilla seeds almonds and fresh florals. Light honey and summer fruits barley notes and vanilla becoming juicier over time with base notes of whole spice before serving up a lemon-and-honey lozenge finish. Very assured this double-distilled single malt is a must for your Irish whiskey shelf. Best Value"
2659,10,"Mandarin segments ripening lime brown sugar breakfast pastries cardamom star anise marzipan and seasoned oak on this triple-distilled Irish single malt. It’s fruity sweet full-bodied and wonderfully rich thanks to the Pedro Ximénez finish. It glides from tangy orange to marmalade with fruit-flavored hard candy clove and allspice. They’ve got this bang on. The spices shut down quickly on the finish leaving baked peel flavors. €340"
2660,10,"Prune fig dried cranberry malt loaf flame-grilled peach a squirt of barbecued meat juices and dry spices including coriander seed and red chili flakes highlight the PX cask aging of this triple-distilled malt. Big flavors in a good full bodied dram with juicy red fruits ruby grapefruit caramelized orange milk chocolate with a thin line of spices and a short chocolate brownie finish."
2661,12,"It’s all about the candied fruit in this single malt sourced from an undisclosed Irish distillery: Skittles grapefruit peel gummy orange wedges green apple candy and Trix cereal on the nose along with white pepper and ginger. A very sweet palate is well-served by its cask strength showing clementine grapefruit guava white pepper and toasted grain. The finish holds nothing back mixing salted pecans leathery oak and white pepper with citrus and grain. 216 bottles"
2662,10,"This dials up the aromas so high it could freshen up a stadium. After a riot of bright fruits paradise slice nutmeg cinnamon dates and raisin the palate becomes awash with apple and rose hip though the strength makes it a wild ride the tongue is conquered into submission. Diluted it shines with vanilla sponge cake plum malt and spicy nutmeg. Beautiful whiskey just needs to be pegged back a bit. €65"
2663,10,"This is the best of the range: It carries more weight and shows greater depth than Royal Oak Distillery’s other Buskers. An enticing nose of fresh conference pear apple peels baking spice nutmeg and a hint of smoked orange peel. Its well-rounded and smooth character carries flavors of toffee apple sultana and vanilla essence broadening out with chocolate ganache active spices milky coffee caramel and rich fruit. Best Value"
2664,10,"Satsuma peel aromatic florals and a low level of aromatic spices then fruit syrups and a hint of olive oil on the nose: It’s clean and bright with plenty of sweetness. The citrus toffee and salted-caramel sweetness of the palate are disrupted by a shockwave of pepper leaving tangy peels hints of nuts and sour gooseberry in its wake before a finish of citrus and sweet barley."
2665,10,"Chocolate Crispy Thins graham cracker barley peppercorn aniseed ground exotic spices and cracker bread but there’s also some perceptible glue-like young whisky notes. The flavors on the palate show the inherent promise of Waterford: barley sugar oat granola baked orange and hefty spices particularly aniseed followed by unsweetened cooking chocolate melting under the spice. This develops into chocolate-covered Brazil nuts and a deep warming glow on the finish. (U.S. Exclusive; 6000 bottles)"
2666,9,"Finished in sherry casks which contribute lush red berried fruit strawberry/rhubarb crumb pie and candied ginger on top of honeyed malt vanilla wafer nougat and warming spice. Oily texture with resinous oak on the finish. Good balance with plenty of character. After years of younger Knappogue releases I’ve really been enjoying the more recent older bottlings like this one. (Allocated mostly to the U.S.)"
2667,10,"One of the most striking-looking new releases around this bone-jangling sepulchral triple-distilled whiskey was once entombed in oloroso sherry butts. A nose of baked apple and sultana rolled marzipan sesame seeds and roasted spices. Smooth tasting with dark fleshy fruits mixed peel chocolate walnut; the taut spicy middle section dies back to baked oranges. A dignified finish with chocolate and nutmeg at the death. Ingest in peace."
2668,10,"Irish bog oak can lie preserved under the turf for thousands of years. The whiskey’s nose is cool and clean the smoke refined and rather elegant with aromas of Brazil nut shells fine Madagascan chocolate and dark unlacquered walking canes. Rich and sweet with chocolate orange fiery spice ginger cake menthol and root ginger crumbling into bitter orange peel bark molasses and coffee grounds. Finish of bitter roots and ginger. (4800 bottles)"
2669,10,"Cut-open pomegranate dried cranberry and rose petals hint at the port cask influence on this whiskey. Brisket and roasted spice aromas of cumin fennel and coriander. Abundant red fruit flavors of cherry redcurrant and pomegranate are swept along on a wave of brown sugar sweetness accompanied by flavors of gummy bear root beer clove ginger pepper and aniseed. Sweet and spicy finish."
2670,10,"Honey baklava lemongrass artichoke vanilla herbal stems and Turkish delight make for a thought-provoking glass of whiskey. Sipping reveals a gentle fruity delight; this is silky smooth and packed with dried fruits mango papaya vanilla light caramel pleasant spices and as it unwinds it oozes honey and sweetness. As the honey and peppery spices fade on the finish a hint of mint appears."
2671,10,"The nose offers antiseptics Band-Aids caramel lemon peel grassy smoke and aniseed balls. As it unfurls the smoke combines with notes of rich chocolate brownie and earthy peat. Honeyed with sweet smoke on the palate juicy citrus notes sherbet vanilla ice cream wafers clementine and a bright finish of tangy citrus and sherbet. Dangerously drinkable and one you’ll want to keep within easy reach for a second pour. (6000 bottles)"
2672,10,"Irish Distillers experimented with 14 year old single malt (sourced from elsewhere as Midleton Distillery doesn’t make it) matured in bourbon barrels with a parcel finished in French oak. The nose is nutty with granola shortbread pecans and a smattering of ground pepper. Smooth flavors of ice cream cone blossom honey vanilla ginger pepper and long-lasting spices. Toffee roasted nuts cinnamon malt and blackening spices carry from the late palate into the finish."
2673,10,"Orange and grapefruit aromas with rosewater vanilla cream bergamot oil and dry barley notes though the nose also detects the high alcohol and some youthful notes. The flavor coalesces around clove and pepper but en route there are sweet barley cereal notes chocolate and malt. After a prolonged swarm of spice the finish has malted milk and old chocolate. (U.S. Exclusive; 13000 bottles)"
2674,9,"Straw color. In both aroma and flavor the whiskey is clean and delicate with notes of creamy malt vanilla and subtle fruit. An enjoyable “anytime” whiskey that slowly reveals its charms the more you get to know it. The third in a series of Knappogue whiskeys that were distilled at Ireland's Cooley distillery (the others being a 1991 and 1990 vintage). This one is fuller in flavor than the previous two but not as distinctive. It's a very pleasant 'anytime' dram."
2689,9,"Very elegant complex and stylish. Honeyed and silky in texture with toffee toasted marshmallow nougat maple syrup banana bread and a hint of toasted coconut. Bright fruit and golden raisin blend in nicely with the layers of sweetness. Impeccable balance and very approachable. Classic Irish whiskey! (Value Pick)"
2690,4,"Irish Distillers has already released two 90+ pot still whiskeys this year but this is the knockout blow an immense take on the wonderful Redbreast. The nose gives little away all damp autumn leaves and fermenting forest fruit but on the palate it's a fireworks display a colorful mix of apple and pear berries vine fruits chocolate liqueur and oily pureed fruit. It's coming to the States soon and rumor has it there's more to follow. But this will do. I can't think if I've ever tasted a better Irish whiskey. €75"
2675,9,"To fully understand this new offering let me offer a little Knappogue Castle background. The first few vintages of Knappogue (not counting the original 1951 vintage which was from the B. Daly distillery) were from Ireland's Cooley distillery--including 1990 1991 and 1992. Then the whiskeys were sourced from Bushmills. The 15 year old reviewed below is from the original Cooley stocks. Consider it an encore performance. Knappogue Castle’s first non-vintage and the oldest since the original 1951 vintage release. The whisky is from three different vintages -- 1990 1991 and 1992 -- which were married together. I am pleased to see an older expression because I have always felt that the previous releases generally 10 years old or less needed a little more time to blossom. Sweeter notes of peaches and cream pineapple upside-down cake banana bread and vanilla wafer are balanced by a spicy resinous dry finish. A textural whisky that coats the palate. My favorite of the post-1951 vintage Knappogues."
2676,10,"Pearse Lyons Distillery opened in 2017 becoming Dublin’s second working distillery this century. This single malt has a nose of honey apple pie with cream light pepper dried grasses and green herbal notes. The orchard fruits of apple and pear are silenced by a fury of pepper root ginger and clove with only grapefruit peel proffered in response. The dry banana chip finish fades in a melee of squabbling spices. (KY GA and FL with expansion planned)"
2677,10,"Quite spicy up front with pepper ginger and a touch of burnt spice with Quaker Oatmeal Squares dunnage floors hazelnut and slightly sour herbal notes of basil and tarragon. There’s a robust surge of pepperiness on the palate after an initial show of dark toffee chocolate and Americano then it wallows in clove cacao nibs leather Brazil nut and baked fruits. (U.S. Exclusive; 13000 bottles)"
2678,10,"Jaffa orange flowers hard candies rose water and light spices make a rather muted offering. Fortunately there’s a sweet malty mouthful of fudge orange shred gingerbread and candied orange slices with a nibble of peppercorn spices and a finish of clove-studded orange. Tasty and well-balanced salvaging the less than inspiring nose. (Travel Retail)"
2679,10,"Darryl McNally’s killer new whiskey was finished in Tokaj casks and launched to coincide with the opening of their new distillery. Inhaling the volatiles evokes scents of lime sugar-sprinkled puff pastry sweet and sour plum toasted oak and Chinese five spice. The waxy mouthfeel with cooked fruit sweet vanilla marzipan orange and plum is silenced when the trigger is pulled on the pepper allspice and clove ending. Well-executed. €160"
2680,10,"Zested lemon pine-scented floor cleaner and quite a grassy proposition with white peach dried flowers perfumed soaps and orange pith. It has a slightly soapy mouthfeel with lavender lemon curd vanilla and clove and pepper the spices ramping up the intensity the longer it’s held in the mouth. Clove and bitter lemon on the finish: takes you from whimsy to wildness in seconds."
2681,9,"Close to one year later than the previous Knappogue Castle release a 15 year old expression and distinctly different in flavor profile. (Think different distilleries.) This one triple-distilled suggests Bushmills origin. Very clean and polished. Gently sweet too with powdered vanilla honeyed malt complex tropical fruit (tangerine kiwi coconut pineapple) and creamy marshmallow. Clean gently sweet finish. Not the most complex Irish I’ve ever tasted but the flavors that are there are tight and well-balanced."
2682,9,"The newest vintage from Knappogue Castle and like the past two vintages this one is from Bushmills. More maturity and oak influence when compared to the 1994. Floral with creamy vanilla toasted oak honeyed malt citrus fruit and marshmallow. Soft creamy finish with delicate oak spice. A clean very drinkable whiskey and my favorite of the post-Cooley Knappogues."
2683,9,"Straw gold color. Very clean aroma and flavor-malty with vanilla cotton candy honey and subtle floral notes. Light in body and somewhat creamy in texture with a soft slightly youthful finish. More Irish character than previous Knappogue bottlings and quite mature for an eight year old whiskey. It is a touch youthful on the finish. While it is quite enjoyable now (and unbelievably drinkable) I would like to have seen this whiskey with another one to two years of aging to give it a little more depth and maturity on the finish."
2684,10,"Comparatively speaking the aromas of red apple peppercorn baked ham and rowanberry make it the least enticing nose in the Tyrconnell range although the port cask endows a beautiful delicate blush to the whiskey’s color. The mouthfeel is thinner too with red apple watermelon mouth-drawing oak fruit chews and burnt spices in the end. A redeeming finish however the gums tingling delightfully with fruit and spice."
2685,9,"The fifth vintage of Knappogue Castle and the second consecutive one comprised of whiskey from the Bushmills distillery. (The previous three were from the Cooley Distillery.) This one is very clean and quite soft on the palate with a gentle sweetness throughout (fresh malt vanilla and honey). Floral and citrus notes offer a subtle pleasantness throughout. Soft soothing creamy vanilla finish with hints of confectioners sugar and lightly toasted marshmallow. This is a pleasant versatile Irish whiskey to have in your bar to serve neat on the rocks or in smart cocktails."
2686,9,"Past bottlings were distilled at the Bushmills or Cooley distilleries (excepting the rare original 1951 Vintage which was from the old B. Daly distillery). This one is triple distilled so think Bushmills. (Cooley distills their whisky twice.) In the past I’ve noticed a lot of flavor development in Bushmills from 10 to 12 years old. This Knappogue 12 year old is a fresh clean smooth Irish whisky displaying a nice creamy texture. I’m finding honeyed vanilla toasted marshmallow and lots of fruit (citrus pineapple coconut and peach). A soft dry oak finish shores up the sweetness and adds a smattering of spice. A pleasant entry-level Irish single malt. (Additional note: Knappogue Castle has historically been a whisky with a vintage not an age statement. While it will be nice to have some consistency here I will miss the subtle differences that each of the previous vintage offerings provided.)"
2687,10,"Give this an hour to unfurl; the nose reveals aged oak pot still spice and engine-oiled machine parts then milk chocolate sesame seeds vintage maps and calfskin vellum before chocolate orange and lighter more pliable wood notes and eventually shortbread and buttercream. The flavors are so vibrant: a brilliant chocolate-orange creaminess penetrating pot still spice gingersnap barley sugar and a treacle-like spicy finish that lasts an eternity. (70 bottles)"
2688,10,"Celebrating the 60th anniversary of a Parisian retailer this represents the most mature Redbreast of the modern era. Rich dark prunes papaya and the aroma of polished antique furniture. Treacle oily and weighty baked apple Black Forest gateaux char and sizzling spices with new flavors appearing minute by minute. Water encourages cherry to the nose and pomegranate to the taste buds. The faithful will respond to the call. (540 bottles La Maison du Whisky only) €490"
2691,10,"This is mastery of American oak! Polished wood cinnamon cereals dry spices of pepper allspice and paprika and a riot of mostly overripe fruit: custard apple mango brown banana baked apricot dessert and fresh fig. Caramel date slices treacle and cracker bread flavors are bathed in feisty pot still spices and fleeting green apple before a lush rich sweetness of banoffee pie vanilla and cinnamon descends. The finish is seemingly eternal."
2692,10,"The latest release pits plum damson fruitcake and rosehip against wild untamed pot still spices straining at the leash. Clove vociferously trumps raisin as the mouth-drawing power is realized; spices deflect off the tongue’s surface like sparks off an anvil. As its grip slackens the fruit ripens bruising slightly yet sweetening deliciously and vanilla pod toasted stave and cinnamon bark emerge. I swear you feel more Irish with every sip. Editors’ Choice"
2693,10,"The thicker air-dried staves of Castanea sativa have a lower density and greater porosity than American oak. The different wood breakdown products enhance the pot still style bringing confectionery sweetness dark prunes and effusive lighter spices. It rolls out a thick red carpet of sweet spice cinnamon and clove with more pot still weight than oak tannins. Move over Redbreast; my pick from this crazy experimental Irish Distillers range.€69"
2694,10,"Following one of 2018’s most collectible releases this vatting of four mature pot still whiskeys finished in a PX butt is quite a departure for Redbreast. The nose has incredible depth with dark sticky concentrated black cherry candied peel coriander leaf vanilla allspice clove and whole almond. This heavy unctuous mouth-coating whiskey resonates with rich fruits clove licorice and juicy blackberry ending with pot still spice and bitter notes. (924 bottles) €380"
2695,10,"Season 2 of Dair Ghaelach sees the action switch to six Irish oaks felled in a County Kilkenny bluebell forest. The balance of spice toasted oak and sweetness on the nose from tree one is singularly good though clementine and grapefruit peel also clamor for attention. The acidity of the citrus collides with crunchy pot still spices and grapefruit evolves into the most delicious ripe mango flavor. Simply heavenly."
2696,10,"A superbly balanced whiskey with huge spices meeting vanilla head on: a perfect complement between the American and Irish oak contributions. It has a softer body with lemon vanilla and meringue in creamy custard sauce but then the spices go off like a rocket and as they glitter across the palate there are glimpses of chocolate coffee and singed oak."
2697,10,"Brooding primal and robust thanks to its fat rolling oily notes slightly fermenting Bramley apples oolong tea green banana hint of sherry and purposeful delivery of allspice peppercorns and star anise. The fruit and chocolate stay one step ahead of the spices; orange chocolate coffee apricot boiled candy marmalade on buttered toast and barley sugar meet a finish of heavier spices bitter chocolate and dusty cocoa. Unmistakable epic whiskey."
2698,4,"Wow! Could this be the greatest comeback since Rocky climbed back in the ring and showed the young upstarts who was the boss? It’s taken Irish Distillers a long time to respond to the pounding it’s taken from Cooley but it’s back in the ring with two wonderful pot still whiskeys. This is the better of the two a whopping oily woody package of classic pot still Irishness. The green fruits tumble over tannin and spice like frisky puppies. €55 (Currently not available in the U.S.)Editor's Choice"
2699,10,"This new permanent addition to the Redbreast range is partially matured in ruby port casks which have helped the vitality and the complexity of the finished whiskey while still delivering a remarkable intensity of red berry fruit. Orange peel pine cone vanilla and walnut on the nose. Raspberry cherry plums and active spices like a wildfire across the tongue with pepper and chile heightened by the strength and menthol late on the finish."
2700,10,"Honey vanilla peppercorn Golden Delicious apples macadamia nut green banana and clove-spiked orange. The flavors are bright with green apple banana vanilla and citrus developing a delicious creaminess to support the pot still spices. The creaminess really crowns this older whiskey as something special with the bourbon wood playing a greater role than in younger jammier Redbreasts. The finish is wonderfully long and warming with spice tangy orange and oak."
2701,10,"Vanilla white pear meringue caramel and lots more toasted oak flavors with nutmeg clove and pepper. This is fruity and sweet with orange pomegranate and caramel then a wild crazy rush of spices. It has a bold and generous nature moving from lime zest to grapefruit with dry oak to finish."
2702,10,"Prominent red apple tropical fruits pot still spices and oloroso sherry notes; this shows great balance. The spices are powerful with a roasted aroma like a crooked burnt match. The palate is gripped by the high alcohol as pepper and clove break open over the tongue into a bed of red apple baked citrus and caramel. Unquenchable layers of flavor usher in a likable bubble gum finish. (252 bottles)"
2703,10,"Among this year’s strong field of new single pot still releases Kilbeggan bottled a gem of an Irish whiskey that sparkled brighter than them all. The already historic whiskey style achieves a powerful air of authenticity. First it’s distilled in the oldest working pot still in Ireland and the 19th-century Locke family recipe incorporates 2.5% oats a common addition at the time. Melon candied peel nutmeg cinnamon and honeysuckle aromas cascade into a palate made especially lush and creamy from the oats with citrus peel apricot and roasted hazelnut flavors leading to a mellow rounded finish adeptly exhibiting a crisp articulation of pot still spiciness throughout. Number 8 in the 2020 Top 20"
2704,10,"Equal parts fascinating and delicious this has a clean and creamy nose with notes of Golden Delicious apples vanilla golden sugar snuff and a sprinkle of lime zest. Brown sugar praline edging on chocolate flavors stone and orchard fruits vanilla light toffee and a late sensation of spices nipping the tongue. Dark toffee coffee grounds and bitter chocolate join the spices in the finish (2500 bottles). (€92)"
2705,10,"The follow up to Small Batch rye this single pot still is double-distilled at the historic Kilbeggan Distillery with a mashbill containing 2.5% oats inspired by a Locke family recipe from the late 1800s. Pot still spices hit the nose first with candied peel baked peach apricot creamy vanilla nutmeg cinnamon and ground pepper. Flavors of orange apricot cake and vanilla combat fizzing pot still spices. Sublimely good Irish whiskey. Best Value"
2706,10,"The 120 year old sherry house Lustau originally operated as an almacenista but now produces a broad portfolio of wine styles in Jerez. The nose is intensely fragrant bursting with fat dates and squidgy prunes red apple and Battenburg cake. It’s fruity yet bone dry with oak walnut and spices. This is full-bodied yet refined Redbreast: the Spanish oak sherry butts shaping the red berry fruits apples marzipan and creamy yet oily consistency. Clean sweet oloroso finish. Qué delicioso!"
2707,10,"An easy-drinking cask-strength whiskey the nose has an equal balance between fruit and spice as red apple and bright cherry meet Chinese five spice savory undertones and salted nuts. This has big chewy sherry notes; it’s quite nutty and the spice starts building early on. Hold out till the end for black cherry toffee and burnt fruitcake with a finish of autumnal fruits menthol and aniseed."
2708,10,"There’s orange peel strawberry fondant vanilla custard and finely ground pepper on the nose. It has plenty of fruit with peach citrus strawberry and vanilla which vie with peppery and clove spiciness before oak vanilla and caramel fade into the finish."
2709,10,"This phenomenal debut is one of the best new single pot still whiskeys around. Caramel brioche satsuma dried apricot aromatic spices canned pears and spiced apple peelings. The palate is creamy lively and fruity with pear apple dried citrus lime fresh plum and toasted coconut accompanied by a formidable pot still spiciness. With the inclusion of Irish barra oats and the balance of sherry and bourbon characteristics this is masterful. (Individual reviewer rating: 93)"
2710,10,"This batch heightens the fruitiness of apple orange peel dried strawberry and peach over potent spices on the nose. Strawberry and raspberry flavors revel in the oily richness then crescendo to a pot still spice storm that rages in the mouth like a swarm of bees. Long spicy finish with vestiges of fruit and toasted oak. Thrill-seekers’ whiskey if you dare."
2711,4,"Like the man himself this is altogether more considered and elegant mixing whiskeys up to 25 years old for a complex and less bruising experience than the Powers. Instead lemon and lime zest kumquat and blood orange entwine themselves around vanilla nutmeg and soft drying tannins. No big knockout punches but it goes the distance and wins unanimously and easily on points. €160 (Currently not available in the U.S.)"
2712,10,"A wave of pot still spice and high alcohol carries aromas of blueberry muffin Victoria plum ground ginger nutmeg and lush sherry. In time greater complexity develops scents of juicy raspberry black olive and rose and violet creams. Dense sherry-wood flavors with chocolate-covered Brazil nuts and nippy peppery spices encircle the tip of the tongue then it finishes with blueberry gum and flashes of candied peel."
2713,9,"Redbreast 12 year old is a classic pure pot still Irish whiskey; where can you go from there? This new 15 year old expression is more muscular (bottling at 46% and not chill filtering certainly helps) but there are trade-offs. It’s a bit closed on the nose (like a great Bordeaux wine that’s too young). I do enjoy the silky/oily texture the bold resinous oak spice grip on the finish and the rich nutty toffee fig black raspberry chocolaty chewy nougat throughout the palate. Still it’s not as eminently drinkable refined or balanced as the 12 year old."
2714,10,"A bold and expressive single pot still with a nose of fudge vanilla plummy sherry notes bramble aromatic spices and dried orange peel. Sweet sherry nutty with a slow build-up of spice to a concentrated peak of clove and peppercorns; then there’s red apple caramel and vanilla as the spices keep going into the dry finish. This one has a lot to say. (252 bottles)"
2715,10,"After decades of consolidation Ireland is experiencing a craft whiskey renaissance. Founded in 2014 The Shed Distillery delivers the first whiskey from the western province of Connacht in over a century. Polished creamy sweetness and aromatic spices herald this striking dram which has been triple-distilled and then matured in first-fill bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. Aromas of caramel brioche satsuma and dried apricot draw you in ushering in a luscious palate of pear apple and freewheeling spices bolstered by dried citrus lime and toasted coconut. Number 14 in the 2020 Top 20"
2716,10,"Triple-distilled in Dublin Teeling’s debut single pot still expression is distinctive in its unusual 50:50 mashbill of malted to unmalted barley adding an element of virgin American oak to deliver a charismatic quality and texture. The nose is reminiscent of cinnamon breakfast cereal with delicate touches of melon and white grape but it’s the vibrancy of the cinnamon nutmeg and pepper at this perfect proof that most impresses taking a decisive lead over the soft stone and orchard fruit and glossy caramel flavors. Number 15 in the 2020 Top 20"
2717,10,"From this first-fill bourbon cask emerge light delicate aromatic fruits: think white peach poached pear and lychee with creamed coconut nutmeg-spiced latte Simnel cake Chinese five-spice and richer apple notes. A seemingly chaste dram that begins with honey egg-washed brioche stewed pears and slender pink rhubarb before innocence is lost as sweet bursts of fruit explode while dark vanilla clove rum and raisin chocolate and rye divert the action. Dried apple with Christmas spices marks the finish. (186 bottles The Whisky Exchange only) £245"
2718,10,"First you think you love Redbreast and then they go and release a triple-distilled single pot still sherry single cask from 1999. Coffee beans chocolate buttons nougat wet leather jackets macaroon and black bananas. A sweet sherry baptism of fresh fig fruit and dark toffee with blackened char wriggling delightfully under the tongue. Thick and oily a savory tone surfaces closed by coffee and heavy clove. Chicory coffee and licorice finish. Epic: extroverted northern cardinal to the chirpy European robin. (576 bottles The Whisky Exchange only) £180"
2719,10,"The Powers Distillery in Dublin historically used the swallow to signify the age quality and purity of its traditional pot still whiskeys. This powerful expression predominantly matured in bourbon with some sherry casks has an intriguing nose of candied peel dried apricot mango strips white pepper herbal notes almond paste and sweet grapefruit flesh. Thick and velvety there’s warm marmalade sugared almonds golden barley citrus green apple and acrobatic spices. A superb introduction to this quintessential Irish whiskey style. Number 18 in the 2019 Top 20"
2720,12,"Perfumy and earthy aromas dominate the nose: dried roses and orange peel talcum
powder moss sandalwood granola toast with honey. Flavors of toasted cedar spruce and
moss woven with spice and pecans are juxtaposed with bright lemon almond cream
orange blossom water and rose petals. The finish is soft and savory with lingering
earthiness. A curious profile that dips and weaves its character almost intangible but
ultimately in balance."
2721,10,"A heart of pot still spices but this has oodles of complexity and depth with concentrated autumnal flavors of apple and blackberry cooked with brown sugar then morello cherry hazelnut allspice aged tobacco leaf and worn leather. Mellow dark-toffee sweetness and cooked fruits carry the cinnamon and peppercorn oak and leather into a tongue-pounding finish. A slap in the chops—just what you want from a pot still whiskey."
2722,10,"Cranberry watermelon and cherry with deeper notes of raisin and prune are lanced by piercing spices. There’s a thick and heavy mouthfeel that begins with caramel and vanilla sliding into chewy toffee with coffee notes and a hint of raspberry though harried by peppery spices so sharp they taste spiky."
2723,10,"A nose of oak lemon meringue pie lashings of vanilla pink peppercorns and paprika. It’s particularly mouth-drawing at cask strength offering vanilla toffee a slight nuttiness and banana with a clove spiciness that really takes hold. It keeps surging forward finding different ways for the spices to peak before settling on a vanilla finish."
2724,10,"Ireland is alive with innovative whiskeys such as this union of single pot still whiskey and the berry flavors of Bo Barrett’s French oak zinfandel casks. A final 12 months of aging in these used Calistoga California wine barrels produces juicy aromas of bramble red apple and cherry with cake mix almond and firm spices. This elevates the enjoyment over regular Green Spot with a swath of ripe red apple damson zested orange and lemon enveloping the pot still spices before a distinctive dry spicy finish. Number 16 in the 2018 Top 20"
2725,10,"With a delicacy often missing from single pot still this shows melon fruitiness white grape and rose water with spice markets cinnamon breakfast cereals and wafting barbecue scents. Apple pear cinnamon nutmeg pepper and ground almond mingle with velvety smooth caramels. An impressive Dublin-distilled pot still debut from Teeling with its diverse cask mix for the 1:1 ratio of unmalted and malted barley to develop texture and complexity. (6000 bottles for U.S.)"
2726,10,"This pale-gold whiskey has a bright and refreshing nose with lots of floral character apricot vanilla frosting apple tart and gentle background spices. Lemon meringue pie sugary sweetness stone fruits vanilla orange citrus and an undertow of spice that mingles higher in the mix by the end: a mirror image of its fragrant aromas. The Method & Madness experimental range is delivering some wonderfully characterful whiskeys that are worth hunting down. (2500 bottles) (€92)"
2727,10,"From Calistoga California to County Cork this zinfandel-finished whiskey has bramble damson jam red apple and glacé cherry with cake mix flaked almonds and a steel-tipped edge of spice. Red apple lemon peel pithy orange and crunchy red apple teasing spice with just a suggestion of mint mingled into the dry spicy finish. First Saint-Julien then Napa; where will Green Spot take our taste buds next?"
2728,10,"Rich dried fruits candied peel dried apricot mango strips white pepper herbal notes almond paste and sweet grapefruit flesh—this has signature notes of Powers all over it. Thick and velvety there’s warm marmalade sugared almonds golden barley citrus and green apple. It’s all quite mellow until the spices work themselves up into a bit of a frenzy. Long fruity finish with toasted coconut and a luscious billowing spiciness."
2729,10,"Spot whiskeys inhabit a flavor profile between Redbreast’s fruitiness and Powers’ muscularity and this feisty newcomer completes the family with its nose of baked apple spiced nuts toffee very crisp spices and cool mint. The creamy palate of melted toffee and condensed milk layers on tangy citrus bitter peels baked lemon apple dried cherry and walnut with peppery pot still spices running amok at full strength."
2730,10,"Bursting with hawthorn red currant cherry pomegranate baked sugar sweetness roasted spices cardamom dark honey and plum pudding. This pot still whiskey from 1985 is mouth drawing with fruit flesh and skins tasting of stewed fruits baked orange apple and pomegranate with a very fine shimmer of spices that sparkles on the tongue. Adding to their canon of single cask Redbreast releases this is absolutely smashing. €500"
2731,10,"Heavy on the oak and spices this has aromas of a carpentry shop with salt and pepper steak rub and a touch of red fruit buried deep in the glass. It has quite a mouthfeel at cask strength; one of those whiskeys that makes your teeth squeaky. Vanilla banana and nicely balanced between the slowly unraveling spices hazelnut and oakiness."
2732,7,"Irish whiskey and rum aren't a common combination but Bushmills makes a strong case for it with a 19 year old whiskey finished in a rum cask. The rum's influence is clearly present on the nose with brown sugar that supports Bushmills’ toasted malt. On the palate the rum's dark molasses complements Bushmills’ chocolate malty goodness. Everything balances out in the mid-palate with the addition of oak which carries through to a semi-dry finish. Superb integration of unlikely cask mates.  (Park Avenue Liquor only)"
2733,10,"Hawthorn apple caramel ground almond shortbread and finely ground pepper on an alluring nose. Gentle creamy mouthfeel with caramel dried apple a moderate attack of clove and pepper and a finish of mild spices and bakery treats. Irish oak-finished whiskeys are a rare occurrence making this a good stepping-stone into the category though it’s mellow by pot still standards. (10500 bottles for U.S.)"
2734,10,"This has more vanilla and caramel with less aggressive wood spices than Tree 1 and aromas of clove sharpened pencils and dried morel mushrooms. It’s fruity and mouth-drawing yet less weighty than Tree 1 reminiscent of fruit Life Savers and baked apple and when it peaks it breaks with more alcohol than spice."
2735,10,"It works like this: triple distilled single pot still whiskey matured in bourbon sherry and Malaga casks which produce a complex drink with aromas of red fruits spice nutmeg-dusted custard tarts blossom honey dried raspberry clotted cream cracked black pepper and sweet flowering jasmine. The sweetness and nutmeg flavors are swallowed up by an overwhelming force of clove with a finish of bitter nut oils and burnt toast."
2736,10,"Mitchell & Son’s classic whiskey finished for 1 to 2 years in wine casks formerly used by the Barton family in the St-Julien appellation. Spiced apple redcurrant blushing pink young raspberries with a deeper earthiness like a hedgerow run wild. An autumnal character: apple rhubarb ginger piquant fruits more vanilla then a finish of sweetened apple and peppercorns. A definite imprint from the higher-strength pot still. It feels like the wine has shaped sculpted and finessed the whisky beautifully. À votre santé!"
2737,10,"Red apples bob in a sea of pot still spice on the nose with whole almond strawberry tarts and brown sugar lumps. This is smooth light and delicious with grilled muffins bourbon biscuits spice vanilla and well-toasted granola with a later development of plum and blackberry. Burnt sugar and more spice on the finish."
2738,10,"An appealing nose as an unrestrained spiciness surges out of the glass uncovering notes of rowan jelly baked pear date and lively sherry notes. Slightly sour baked Bramley apple flavors are sideswiped by a rush of spices on a wave of high-strength alcohol somewhat anticlimactically suspending further flavor development. Water rescues coaxing out lemon and gooseberry with spice-flecked vanilla toffee to finish. (252 bottles)"
2739,10,"Cherry raisin aniseed ground pepper and fruitcake on the nose. The taste experience builds to a spicy clove and pepper fistfight and while there are glimpses of red apple it takes time for the spiciness to subside and the other flavors don’t ever really get a chance. Even the chocolate notes on the finish are harried by the spices. Dilution delivers much more enjoyable flavors. (252 bottles)"
2740,10,"A moreish nose rich and sophisticated this was matured for 5 years in marsala vergine casks. A malty nose with cinnamon dark rye bread plain chocolate toasted cereals worn leather plum sauce dry spice and dark red fruits is testament to the cask influence. Mouth-drawing on the palate there’s raspberry black grape brown sugar cherry syrup blueberry and bramble with a finish of fruit skins and spice."
2741,10,"A fruity tour de force matured for 5 years in bourbon barrels this revels in aromas of vanilla sponge cake honey summer fruits in syrup fresh cream apricot nectarine apple and green mango. Very approachable on the palate with vanilla cream thick custard citrus lime lemon zest baked apricot peppercorn green melon apple and candied peel. The spices drop out leaving fruit flan orange honey and a gooseberry sharpness on the finish."
2742,10,"A decent progression of flavor with PX cask influences: heather honey toasted oat and sultana granola hearty prune and fig notes vanilla essence roasted spices peppercorn and baked ginger loaf. Plenty of flavor here but it needs more body to complete the experience; golden syrup spices arrive and depart quickly leaving oozy caramel cereal bars dried and tropical fruits fruitcake and nutmeg ending with bramble black cherry and peppery spice."
2743,10,"Backyard bonfire smoke black pepper charred oak aniseed and smoked fish going from peppered mackerel to Arbroath smokie but the smokiness from the Islay cask finish overpowers this young whisky at times hindering the appreciation of other distillate characters. To taste there’s sugared breakfast cereal fudge donut glaze vanilla stewed apple black currant pepper clove and background smoke with a pepper and salted caramel finish."
2744,4,"It might be Italian single malt but it isn’t whisky. It’s getting there though and this is very sippable in its own right. This is from the far North of Italy where the influence is heavily Austrian. It’s very well made indeed is bursting with vibrant fruit and is good enough now to be enjoyed as an aperitif. It will appeal to Italian palates which are fond of very young spirits. €35"
2745,4,"A single malt it may be because it’s the product of one distillery but a single grain it’s not. In fact there are three malted grains in this and that makes for a punchy vibrant fruity and menthol-tinged new make spirit but with a sweet cereal note and some distinctive spiciness from the rye. Different and interesting up to a point; very well made but still new make spirit at the end of the day. €30"
2746,10,"This second batch was sherry matured before a 27–month sakura cask finish; it’s intricate and contemplative. Cherry lozenge caramelized sugar black currant strawberries with cream on puff pastry rose petal vanilla icing apricot coriander seed and white pepper though the aromas can be quite fleeting. The palate glides through gentle honey strawberry tingling spices caramel stone fruit light cherry and hints of red apple. Utterly charming: the Hello Kitty of whiskies. (1062 bottles)"
2747,10,"Drink this the next time you want a mug of hot chocolate by a roaring peat fire. Whole lemon earthy chocolaty peat notes gentle ashy smoke mocha and Nutella on the nose with some deeper sooty charcoal notes. After a 32-month finish in Islay casks this carries plenty of weight with flavors of chocolate brownie dates cocoa powder and light ground pepper that intensifies into a riot of smokin’ hot peppercorns. (1242 bottles)"
2748,10,"Fully matured in cognac casks for 10 to 13 years the nose initially has vanilla sugar dried banana lemon and lime hard candies then pineapple chunks lemon zest pink peppercorns and hints of pine floor polish. In contrast the scrumptious palate is like a plate of homemade cookies with praline milk chocolate dark fruits caramel sauce vanilla custard and chocolate brownies ending with a dry finish of lightly spiced cookie dough. (2109 bottles)"
2749,10,"Get back to nature; this is a whisky to savor during a spectacular sunrise. Lychee edamame pea shoots green apple and morning dew on lush lawns. As it warms and wakes up there are hints of orange and some piquant spice. The taste jumps from lemongrass to lemon candies with melon mild peppercorn gentle vanilla creamy oak and a few green notes at the end."
2750,10,"A decade of aging in an oloroso cask has bestowed aromas of stewed plum prune throat lozenges and thick fronds inside a tropical palm house while still executing the same dreamily serene Kikori character. Age has enhanced the mouthfeel of this rice whisky serving up a smooth clean palate of tart orange damson and plum sweetness with a complex twist of spice and drying orange peel on the finish. (312 bottles for U.S.)"
2751,10,"The well-balanced nose is terrific with jasmine-scented candles banana peach pit Banoffee pie and polished oak becoming lush and fruity with blackberry green apple and fragrant spices. In the swirl of aromas there’s harmony. Light bodied with satsuma segments cotton candy milk and cookies dried fruits and fruity candy toward the end. The low filling strength may be the cause of less influence of the mizunara cask over the 24-month finish. (2004 bottles)"
2752,10,"Fantastically nutty sherry notes like a good amontillado with aromas of cooking apple plum pecan pie pencil shavings and wood spices. The sherry cask adds depth flair subtlety and expressiveness to both the nose and palate. To taste there is orange peel nuts crystallized grapefruit peel fresh plum clove and pepper. The sweet light flavors keep it aloft as more base notes help to fill it out. (4090 bottles)"
2753,10,"Disgorged from a 440-liter new oak cask this is like a spiced blueberry muffin. The aromas evolve before your very nose; spicy punch dried conifer cone dark toffee cola candy strawberry laces baked plum banana skin and ground pepper. A light palate mouth-drawing at times with pastry butter croissant and dried raspberry developing richer fruits and sweetness with toffee black fruits chewed leather and base notes of pepper. (420 bottles)—"
2754,10,"A mercurial nose like many rice whiskies: pear honeydew chopped ginger lemongrass green herbal notes wild garlic white pepper mineral elements and seashells. Drawn from a combination of refill sherry refill new oak and one red wine cask the aromas are matched by a dense palate of honey herbal notes melon poached pear ginger spice lemongrass pepper vanilla and lemon peel with a tingly spicy aftertaste. Definitely worth experiencing. (3824 bottles)"
2755,10,"Components range from 7 to 27 years old the oldest distilled by the current 6th-generation master distiller’s own father. Pepper allspice baked peach white pepper vanilla fudge pancake batter and orange essence on the nose. Cocoa-dusted red fruits a burst of spice then sharp orange soft fudge and red apple. Complex and piquant: fermented fruits chocolate brownie and creamy coffee to finish. Born to be mild. (1606 bottles)"
2756,10,"Peppercorns and aromatic spices ride over baked orange toffee and lemon peel. The spices are buzzing like you’ve face-planted on a hornets’ nest and it’s a blast: dry-roasted spice rubs cumin coriander seed and some bitter blackened spice notes. In comparison the palate feels like an anticlimax; mild and light with lemon honey a Peppermint Pattie’s center vanilla fudge and zested orange with the spices reduced to a background hum. (7077 bottles)"
2757,10,"Baked oat cookie walnut allspice and a hint of rosehip though the aromas become quite spicy in time crackling with ground ginger and pepper. The palate has a mouth-drawing heavy texture and tastes joyously like a liquid toffee apple after two years in the port cask. Supported by flavors of cake mix sultana and gentle spices it has a dry finish of fading fruit and chocolate cake. (1490 bottles)"
2758,10,"The nose has plum flesh sanded oak allspice and walnut shells but it’s a little undemonstrative. The redemption comes with tasting. Here lush sherry notes wash over the tongue in waves as it shows dark fruits plum wine toffee fresh fig sultana tobacco leaf walnut and orange peel. Don’t overlook this whisky; just take a quick sniff then luxuriate in the fine sherry cask flavors on your taste buds. (888 bottles)—"
2759,10,"Prunes forest honey vanilla seeds dark chocolate cookies and Brazil nut with hints of chocolate orange and ground pepper: I’m hooked. Cocoa Whoppers baked orange jellied peel jumpy peppery spices tamarind bark and milk chocolate pralines on the palate and chocolate stewed fruits and walnut once the strength dies down. This is the complete package and a prime contender as one of the year’s tastiest new Japanese whiskies."
2760,10,"Gentle aromatic peat smoke straw ruddy red apples and soft sponge puddings. There’s a dry spicy edge to the peat smoke that makes it really quite exquisite. Apples browning in sugar iced chocolate cake and luxuriously creamy it becomes oily with a lengthy phase of active spicy pepper oak and smoke though the creaminess returns if you give it long enough. A smoky aftertaste with malt and cocoa powder."
2761,10,"Icy cool clinical whisky with a precision delivery of peat smoke and icing sugar vanilla sponge cake attractive spiciness and a touch of mint on the nose. The mouthfeel is effervescent with fizzing spices buckets of bourbon-cask sweetness sugary vanilla and a huge thrust of clove at full strength becoming richer as the peat smoke blows through. Water coaxes out lime and clementine peel and a deeper more rounded smoke. (2109 bottles)"
2762,10,"It’s the 100th anniversary of the marriage of Masataka and Rita Taketsuru and there’s plenty to celebrate with sweet red apples and soft pear on the nose plus festive spices peppercorn cinnamon stick warmed apple slices apricot lemon zest and lightly charred oak. Creamy with cooked fruit dipped in sweet syrup vanilla toffee apple and honey with just a prickle of spices swimming against the weight of the fruit."
2763,10,"Distilled at Mars Shinshu but matured in the Mars Tsunuki aging cellar this charms with fresh fruity notes of raspberry apple and pear with banana loaf baking spices lemon zest and seasoned oak. The opening flavors of vanilla fudge and warm fruits are submersed by a vigorous peppery incursion though there’s pear chocolate malt and vanilla pod flavors once that settles. I recommend experimenting to pinpoint your preferred dilution."
2764,10,"Aromas of ripe peach barley dry spices waxy green leaves baked citrus scorched earth and dried flowers on Hombo Shuzo’s debut whisky from Mars Tsunuki Distillery produced in the 2016–2017 season. Sipping reveals sweet orange chocolate and clove though the spices are straining at the leash and the high-strength alcohol can KO unwary taste buds. Dilute and the fruits shine beautifully while the spices are kept in check. (9984 bottles)"
2765,10,"The Hokkaido Akkeshi Distillery started in 2016 and with access to local peat it has designs on a distinctive Islay style. This high-strength expression is lightly peated and shows molten caramel crushed spices campfire smoke dried coconut strips peppercorn and rice cakes. Toffee cooked apple and marmalade on first sip it’s tangy with mango canned peaches dried papaya and a streak of clove and pepper."
2766,10,"Juicy and punchy nose with highly promising sherry notes; blueberry bramble nutmeg and fine pepper with date currant stewed Bramley apples and fruity Madagascan dark chocolate. The palate doesn’t quite reach the heights of the nose but sweet fruit sugar barley and orange peel keep the peppery spice in check before settling down to a final plateau of strawberry jam with hints of tobacco and plum."
2767,10,"Treat your nose to an education in young whisky and enjoy the flavors as this is just 16 months old. Young and green aromas with citrus fresh pear young peapods cress pencil erasers and the glue strips on manila envelopes; it’s unencumbered by sweetness or oak influence. Orange zest chocolate and sugary sherbet ride a shuddering wave of alcohol from which Oreo cookies mint and Belgian chocolate cigarellos emerge."
2768,10,"When whisky lovers talk about the grandeur of Japanese whisky the enlightenment they desire can be found within this bottle. A refined luxury evocative of toasted marshmallow sweet incense butter-soft caramels oak spices and ground cinnamon. All the hallmarks of mizunara are here. Concentrated sweet citrus so intensely fruity on the palate; the mouthfeel is rapturously silky with touches of mango dried apricot and gentle but resilient spices."
2769,1,"Though aged in virgin American oak it’s distillery character that’s in charge here; a fully expressive Yoichi. Rich mysterious layered mixing rich fruit compote with scented coastal smoke (ozone tar soot) alongside masses of vetiver and cigar humidor. The palate is oily and immense with fluxing layers of sweet fruit oily peat salt and ink; camphor flax seed and in among the smoke apple mint. Long insanely complex and jaw-droppingly good. This will go down as a classic. €185"
2770,1,"Produced at Miyagikyo’s grain distillery from 100% malted barley this is rich gold in hue while the nose is big and luscious with plenty of ripe banana crushed hazelnut and an intriguing green malt note behind. As it opens there’s the effect of a high-cocoa chocolate bar melting in your hands as well as coconut vanilla fudge and basil. With water (and it needs it) there’s honey on hot buttered toast. The palate is sumptuous; that banana’s now flambéed. Super ripe and fascinating. A grain for malt lovers. £99. Price in US dollars converted at time of review."
2771,1,"Nikka’s first distillery is located in the eponymous town on the western coast of Hokkaido. Here power is the key. Deep and rich with a distinct oiliness — somewhere between linseed and cod liver — there’s also plenty of smoke in the mix as well and a little hint of black olives in brine with ripe apples lurking behind. I hate making comparisons between Japanese and Scotch single malt but if I was forced to Yoichi reminds me most of Springbank (edging into Longrow). Water dampens the personality too much for me; best have it full-on and uncompromising.
Rather than the palate showing a slow procession of flavors along the tongue this is a layered whisky; coal-like oily and richly fruited with a distinct saltiness on the sides ably demonstrating that Japan has almost as much variety on offer as scotch. £76.95."
2802,10,"Fully matured in mizunara oak on land and sea this has tangy orange ground ginger fennel seed cedar and incense though it seems a little more tightly wound than the standard strength whisky. Juicy orange quick firecracker spices and more toffee sweetness; it becomes heavy and thick flaunting high alcohol then turns creamier with marzipan orange Jell-O and singed oak spices."
2772,8,"Notably balanced and elegant the colorful palette of whiskies combines for tremendous depth of flavor. Soft sweet butterscotch and orange peel meet poached pears and stone fruits. Earthiness appears as dried autumn leaves coffee old oak and tobacco. Among the tangle of spices tasters identified chili pepper allspice cloves and universally adored its ginger note. Finally wisps of smoke and sea salt. Overall it feels generously malty with the grain whisky lending broad sweetness and supple mouthfeel across the long finish.

Beyond its delightful flavors Nikka From the Barrel presents some paradoxes worthy of contemplation over a glass. It is a classic yet new to the U.S. It is typically Japanese yet singularly magnificent. It is delightful sipped neat and also blossoms with water. Even the simple squat bottle is in contrast to the profound complexity within. (Fortunately the 500 ml bottle offered in other markets received a supersizing for U.S. drinkers.)

The great majority of new Japanese whiskies now arriving to our shores are so rare and so expensive that they seem intended only for elite whisky lovers. Nikka From the Barrel is a consummate Japanese blend for anyone to enjoy. Number 1 in the 2018 Top 20"
2773,10,"This dark dram is distilled from malted and unmalted rice along the Kuma river in Hitoyoshi. The nose is redolent of stewed prunes raisins plum wine and walnut with a palate of treacle molasses burnt sugar licorice prune dark fruits mocha praline and nuttier elements. Skillfully it never veers into bitterness. This should rock the boat for those who love a huge sherried-style whisky. (506 bottles)"
2774,9,"Deep mature in nature and very complex. Notes of polished leather maple syrup and dark pit fruit with suggestions of tobacco smoke wood shavings and unsweetened chocolate. References to fine old bourbon and ultra-matured pot-still rum provide intrigue. Proof that Japan produces some outstanding distinctive whiskies. Nicely done!"
2775,10,"The first thing you notice is the elegant fragrance of lychee spring blossoms lily rosewater and raspberry meringue. Deeper in grassy notes with star fruit kumquat and kaffir lime leaves. The flavors offer perfection in their simplicity: silky honey soft spices crystalized pineapple barley sugar lemon and orange. On the finish the spices chatter on and on as the sweet citrus and honey fade in and out. One to cherish."
2776,10,"Produced by Kumesen Distillery the Okinawan awamori maker that coincidentally sells a 2001 awamori matured in American oak at 42% in Europe. The nose has cinnamon molasses vanilla seeds and charred oak. It’s a big chewy oily mouthful packed with cinnamon pecan pie an explosion of spices toffee stewed fruit and licorice with a long sweet and nutty finish. Deliciously against the grain. (3600 bottles)"
2777,1,"The final deal of Ichiro Akuto’s Card Series a vatting of Hanyu from 1985 to 2000. Highly complex rich and distinctly resinous. Typical Hanyu boldness but with balance struck between weightiness finesse and intensity. There’s old cobbler’s shop tack room light smoke incense ink autumn leaves and sumac. The palate is sweet to start then builds in power. Leathery then praline damson jam and fine tannins. Water loosens the tension allowing yuzu to show. What a way to go out. £220"
2778,10,"Jota Tanaka Kirin’s chief blender utilizes all the versatility of the complex production at Fuji Gotemba Distillery to create this truly superb non-chill filtered whisky. The dark vanilla toffee brittle macadamia nuts heady incense and singed oak have instant appeal. Sweet popcorn smothered in milk chocolate rotates through cherry damson and red apple settling on a palate of toffee apple spiked with pepper and licorice. Tingling spices on a drying finish. £41"
2779,10,"Bottled to celebrate the refurbishment of Mars Shinshu Distillery it’s named after the area’s native chestnut tiger butterfly. The nose is beautiful but delicate: cotton candy spring blossoms powders and lotions rose-scented Turkish delight fresh linen and cherry sherbet. The palate offers ripe orchard fruit vanilla custard clove and honey. Its smooth mouthfeel makes graceful transitions between flavors showing glimpses of cherry and strawberry. (1122 bottles for U.S.)"
2780,10,"Stewed gooseberry scallions chopped chives fine-ground pepper rolled oats and sweet oak combine to create a sweet and herbal dram. Full-bodied on the palate this boasts stewed fruits brown sugar cooked apple and delicious baked desserts. Drawn from a specially selected new oak cask this Fukano is the most interesting of the brand’s 2019 releases. (487 bottles)"
2781,1,"Sweet with subtle crisp nutty oak then comes fudge ripe banana and peach. The overall effect is like eating vanilla ice cream with toffee fudge and hazelnut sprinkles. The structure is thick and physical the palate sweet and quite fat with light hints of raspberry fruit salad. A jag of acidity freshens the delivery on the finish. With water there’s more toffee and it becomes slightly more yielding with less oak. For me the gold standard of grain."
2782,10,"This is a nuanced delicacy so tread lightly. It offers a nose of rich apple oloroso sherry cranberry pepper fennel star anise and a touch of milk chocolate. The sherry casks are at play: dark ruby fruits peppery spice and cinnamon. The mouthfeel holds steady with Cola Cubes stewed blackberry and apple peels as the spices fall out ending with cocoa-dusted dried fruits. (1479 bottles)"
2783,10,"Satisfyingly smoky with noticeable structure and complexity: grilled fish burning aromatic grasses cocoa powder and jellied and tropical fruit flavors. Soft pulpy fruits to taste with red apple nippy ginger and pepper spices a surge of orange and mango flavors and a backdraft of smoke. The nostrils still detect a delightful kipperiness. Smoke writhes like a serpent on the finish sliding off walls dripping with sweet tropical fruits. (3972 bottles)"
2784,10,"Sooty charcoal aromas with a sweet edge of mango and other tropical fruits mingle with coriander seed and cardamom. It tastes of ripe melon pear and mango with pepper aniseed and a strong seam of smoky oak char. An extra burst of fruit in the finish with sweet peat smoke. If you enjoyed the rum-finished expressions of Kilchoman or Bunnahabhain Moine this one’s for you. (3500 bottles; sold as a set with Miyagikyo Rum Wood Finish 2017)  €395/set"
2785,1,"A high-strength blend that takes no prisoners. The color is full gold and the first thing that hits the nose is a complex mix of restrained smoke (sandalwood cigar) fennel and celery before semi-dried tropical fruits and orange peel take over. The palate also shows some of that mango character but also crisp oak and a burst of sweet powdered spices on the finish. A malt-lover’s blend."
2786,10,"Mizunara oak is the modern signature of Japanese whisky and Kaiyo- whisky enables inquisitive imbibers to savor the spice incense and sandalwood flavors of this rare wood for an attractive price. Distilled and matured in Japan the casks then undergo a three-month ocean voyage from Osaka to Liverpool before bottling to encourage further flavorsome interactions. Ground spices vanilla sponge cake honey brown sugar cubes and scents of aromatic woods and incense. Pastry egg custard and allspice flavors followed by a wave of vanilla creaminess and a lengthy finish with fading spices. Number 14 in the 2019 Top 20"
2787,10,"Kurayoshi Distillery lies between Osaka and Hiroshima in the foothills of Mount Daisen where it produces single malt whiskies brought to proof with soft mountain spring water. The label adorned by Hokusai’s The Great Wave portends this whisky’s rush of flavor: satisfyingly smoky with noticeable structure and complexity. Kippers on the nose with burnt aromatic grasses cocoa and jellied fruits and a smoky palate of red apple ginger pepper orange and mango. Smoke writhes like a serpent on the finish sliding off the walls dripping with sweet tropical fruits. Number 19 in the 2019 Top 20"
2788,10,"Yoichi age statements are gone for now but if the whisky stays this good I can live with that. Black earthy peat smoldering fires a turned-out pocket of briny seashells whole lime lemon twist sugared orange ground ginger and licorice. Silky smooth with light fruity sweetness developing into tangy Spangles kiwi and lime juice. The smoky peat is the weft woven through the fruit structure’s warp. The finish is insanely long: menthol peat and leather."
2789,10,"Trademark rich ripe fruitiness abounds here with a mashbill of malts consisting of Braemar peated Concerto and floor-malted Tipple. Fruit hard candy pear melon skin green apple and grassy turf smoke on the nose. It’s a big juicy whisky on the palate with tangy citrus pear vanilla and caramel sideswiped by pepper and clove. Ride it out to discover Skittles honeydew and a lengthy finish of Golden Delicious apple. (1556 bottles) Collectible"
2790,10,"Finely ground spice vanilla sponge cake light honey and brown sugar cubes as well as the mizunara fingerprints of aromatic wood and incense. Pastry egg custard and allspice flavors; there’s just enough body apparent as the spices settle down unleashing a substantial wave of vanilla creaminess. Leaves a long aftertaste like a light-hearted pillow fight between the vanilla cream and the fading spices."
2791,10,"Yes there is a cute mewing black kitten on the label. Turkish delight pomegranate rose water lemon lime zest clementine and sandalwood. A syrupy texture with the sweetness of hard fruit candy; there are flavors of cooked apple mandarin butterscotch melon ginger and chili pepper. The slow crescendo of spices is particularly impressive. The pleasantly fruity finish sees a drop-off in the spices. Distinctively aromatic and exotic."
2792,10,"Date raisin forest honey star anise black cherry graham cracker and wood spices on the nose. Although it’s a first-fill sherry cask this has a fine balance of sherry influence without letting the cask dominate the aromas. A good mouthful of dark fruit toffee sweetness plum and mild spices but after the initial tasty burst of sherry fruit it doesn’t discernibly develop further complexity. (1124 bottles)"
2793,10,"Sweet honey pears melon and vanilla sponge with smoke that is both sweet and acrid and cuts through like a knife. Islay knows that delicious combination of sweetness fruitiness and smoke very well and this could be amazing with a firmer weightier texture. Flavors of watermelon taffy squeezed lime and candied pineapple with the smoke and meek spices growing in strength adding smoked chocolate notes before a short finish. (5000 bottles)"
2794,1,"This oldie (from a distillery which closed in 2000) seems pretty straightforward compared to the Mizunara [see following review] but has less dried fruit than the sherry note on the label might suggest. Think dried peels rather than raisin then stir in some freshly-polished floor. The aromas are saturated and heavy — almost as if they are drifting towards you on humid air.
The palate shows light smoke and then a pleasant quinine bitterness mid-palate. This has the Japanese quality of laying flavors out very precisely on the tongue while also heightening their intensity. Water reduces the quinine effect allowing the richness of the spirit to come through. Hanyu was a pretty big and firm (even rigid) whisky. Here that shell has cracked allowing anise and blueberry to come through.
£450. Price in US dollars was converted at time of review."
2795,10,"Don’t get me wrong this is delicious but while the mizunara oak subtleties cannot match the intensity of the sherry influence on the nose its flavor contribution to this multidimensional whisky is rather wonderful. Strawberry sherry fig prune and nuts on the nose and palate enriched with fragrant spices millionaire’s shortbread vanilla tablet base notes of pepper and a finish of sherry fig and spice."
2796,10,"This new higher proof Iwai (pronounced EE-why) was designed for cocktails; however it’s supple and more than capable as a neat sipper too with pleasing aromas of honey ripening pear barley exotic woods and citrus. The palate of honey sweetness sugar cubes vanilla pear apricot and spice bows out with honey breakfast cereal nougat and white chocolate. It’s a delicious and unusual whisky from Japan less aligned with the country’s scotch-like tradition of malts and blends and more similar to bourbon being made mostly from corn. Number 19 in the 2020 Top 20"
2797,10,"Drawn from bourbon casks refill chibidaru quarter casks and mizunara-head hogsheads this has barley dried apricot finely ground pepper and sugared apple on the nose. Wafting peat smoke aromas are accentuated by dilution. Incredibly fruity with plenty of body the initial apple pear and spike of pepper are overtaken by golden syrup vanilla pastry candied fruits and fruity desserts. Stick with cask strength: Water releases gooseberry sharpness and quells the spices. (11000 bottles 288 for U.S.)"
2798,10,"Distilled at the Shinshu distillery in Nagano and matured both there and at the aging cellar on Yakushima Island this whisky has a compelling balance of cask influences. Aromas of honey cherry gummy bears red apple heady floral scents banana muffin vanilla essence menthol and feisty aromatic spices. The palate takes a journey through honey grapefruit lime zest Honey Smacks cereal red apple playful spices then more sherry fruit matched by ginger clove and pepper. (3659 bottles)"
2799,10,"If whisky were a warm hug this would be it. The sweet nose is rich with a lovely fruitiness of satsuma Seville orange marmalade yuzu and vanilla. This carries a velvety texture rippled with an orange-flavored effervescence; apricot jam sweet orange sherbet fine spices ground ginger and hot pepper. If this well-made example is an indication of the Mars Shinshu house style they are getting a lot of things right. (10000 bottles)"
2800,10,"Wonderful to see this portly bottle in U.S. stores at last. An exotic nose with turned woods stewed plum sultana ground ginger dried chilies and black cherry it oscillates between spice and dark fruits. Rich smoke is packed deep; it’s far from the most dominant aroma. Orange cherry mango and bubble gum  notes are beaten back by a spicy rush of ginger and pepper the sweetness prevailing over the cloves. Editors' Choice"
2801,1,"A celebration of Nikka’s 80th anniversary and in the spirit of the founding principles of Masataka Taketsuru it’s a blend. The oldest cask here is Yoichi from 1945 there’s also a Miyagikyo from 1969. Only 900 bottles have been made. Huge whisky rancio delicate smoke light varnish wax hints of incense and while rich there is still remarkably fresh tropical fruit. Tasted blind it could easily be mistaken for a Grand Champagne Cognac. Amazing length and purity. Sophisticated. €3600"
2803,10,"This is utterly unique; made from imported Scottish peated malt it spends 2 years in madeira casks then 6 years in mizunara casks. Light clean fruity refreshment: apple white grape lingering cigar smoke coconut macaroons and ample Japanese oak influence. Apple and watermelon flavors developing a more sugary fruitiness of Life Savers hard candy all brushed with gentle spice and a swish of smoke."
2804,9,"The first vintage Suntory Yamazaki offered in the U.S. A portion of this whisky is aged in Japanese oak. Heavy aroma with lush sherried fruit and deep juicy oak marrying with firmly dry and spicy oak resin (the Japanese oak influence is obvious). This same profile follows through on the palate: ripe berried fruit raisin blackberry jam plum spiced with cinnamon vanilla spearmint roasted nuts and gripping leather. All this lying on a bed of molasses and toffee. The Japanese oak really kicks in on the invigoratingly spicy warm resinous finish. Quite elderly in nature but remains very exciting and dynamic even with all the oak."
2805,10,"This boasts a nice balance of baked apple stewed fruits fresh spices and deeply caramelized sugar. The integration of the spice and fruit is a notable Japanese whisky hallmark and the dense mouthfeel peels back layers of dark syrup plum chocolate burnt cookies baked sugared fruits and background spice. The finish sees the spices perk up against the fading strength of the fruit and chocolate flavors. (3000 bottles; 564 for U.S.)"
2806,10,"A delightful fruity specimen with lime Asian pear grapefruit tangerine mango melon taffy and a hint of white pepper. More tropical fruit notes to enjoy on the tongue: papaya dried melon strips passion fruit melon and fruit syrups all floating along on a slick of gooey caramel. Continuity of the fruit-bomb theme continues into a finish of fleshy stone fruits infused with a sprinkle of gentle spices. (3850 bottles)"
2807,10,"Ice cream cone vanilla and white chocolate with a twist of orange peel. The new and refill American and European oak casks give this a soft milky comforting nose. The medium-weight palate includes light fudge vanilla and green fruits with spices on the fringes and a glowing orange core developing over time. A sweet creamy finish with a hint of spice. This will win you over with its effortless charm. (1800 bottles)"
2808,1,"Unlike their colleagues in Scotland Japanese distillers do not exchange stock for their blending requirements. This means that each distillery is set up to produce a wide range of styles. Hakushu uses four different types of malt (unpeated to heavy) run through four pairs of differently-shaped stills. Each single malt is a different blend of these bases. While still herbal this example shows more sherried notes along with sour orange zest tropical fruit and some smoke. Complex.£105"
2809,1,"As the price may suggest there ain’t a lot of this around but to see Hakushu at its most robust try and find a bar with a bottle. Again the sherry component has been upped as has the smoked element. There is however always that graceful Hakushu purity running through this time expressed as rhubarb and strawberry. The palate shows great oily depth hints of walnut and yes a sprig of mint tying it to the 10 year old. £555"
2810,1,"Mizunara—or Japanese oak—was considered inferior for many years. Only recently have its extraordinary aromatic qualities been appreciated. These are immediately apparent on the nose: aloes wood incense sandalwood cinnamon balls sour cherry and apple becoming more gingery with water. Intense and acidic in the mouth there are tart stewed red fruits pomegranate and citrus. Lightly bitter tannins add to the complexity as does the smoke rising from the smoldering incense stick. The most significant Japanese whisky of the year?  £250"
2811,10,"The legacy of the cask’s history imparts more smoke than peat. It hasn’t overpowered the spirit but the whisky is light enough to be put in the shade with singeing smoke coal dust vanilla and asphalt. Sweet rice vanilla honey and warm spices of ginger root and black peppercorn before a late arrival of peat. Milk chocolate burnt driftwood toffee and a little residual pepper on the finish. (636 bottles)"
2812,10,"Supple nose of lychee ripening peaches candy hearts watermelon allspice and white pepper. A light slightly syrupy texture with an underbelly of watermelon and raspberry this year’s release unwraps peach nectarine rhubarb and custard candy fruit Life Savers stewed fruits red berries and light citrus. It’s surprising just how much flavor is packed into this rice whisky. Finish is dry—the watermelon is gone. (4411 bottles)"
2813,10,"Fuji-Gotemba Distillery’s talent for grain whisky is evident here with a nose of waxy green leaves whole peppercorn and fleeting glimpses of lemon peel lime zest and white peach amid the airy floral top notes. It has a serene calming quality to it. Spicy pepper orange peel mouth-coating vanilla creamy toffee and crunchy apple with a clean finish like orange flesh laid out on
hot stones. JPY 5000"
2814,10,"Very pale fresh whisky with lychee fresh pear morning dew apple notes and just a dash of salt and white pepper. It’s a honeyed and thick dram on the palate with caramelized apples and tangerine then late bittersweet citrus that attempts to dampen down the jackhammer of pepper. Enjoyable weight texture and flavors but the mizunara signature notes are a little subtle and underplayed. (3972 bottles)"
2815,10,"Japanese rice whiskies enjoy a cult following for their delicate flavors. This Fukano stands out with its ethereal fruity delights the result of meticulous vigilance to preserve the spirit’s subtle nature. It brings a supple nose of lychee ripe peaches Smarties watermelon allspice and white pepper. A light slightly syrupy texture is underscored by watermelon and raspberry as it unwraps peach nectarines rhubarb and custard candy fruit Life Savers stewed fruits red berries and light citrus. Fukano promises to broaden our whisky horizons. Number 20 in the 2017 Top 20"
2816,1,"This single malt bottling shows Miyagikyo’s emollient style at its best. This is all about super-soft orchard fruits; think apricot and sweet persimmon though there’s also a touch of sweet sawdust and even a whiff of pine sap and milk chocolate. It demonstrates the classic Japanese trick of being both clear and precise in its aromas as well as being heightened in intensity. The palate is a little slow to start with offering a mix of spruce and pine then those soft fruits carry you onward.
In some ways the gentle charms of Miyagikyo are overshadowed by the rambunctious nature of From The Barrel and Yoichi but soft is a worthy element in Japanese — nay all — whisky. £76.95. Price in US dollars converted at time of review."
2817,10,"A unifying blend of 10 year old Chichibu with select stocks of American Canadian Irish and scotch whiskies matured in Japan produces a nose of toffee apple firm caramel milk chocolate ground hazelnut roasted fennel seed chopped cilantro stalks green banana and struck match. Cereal-led palate with Golden Grahams light fruits of apricot peach and melon base notes of pepper moving through butterscotch toffee maple syrup and crème caramel. (U.S. Exclusive)"
2818,10,"Boosting the ABV gives this more versatility for whisky-based cocktails but neat there are aromas of honey barley exotic woods ripening pear box-fresh sneakers citrus and fruity acids with the spices turned down low. A convoluted profile winds through vanilla sugar cubes and honey fudge followed by pear apricot and a gentle crescendo of spice before hitting a plateau of honey breakfast cereal nougat and white chocolate to finish. Best Value"
2819,1,"Poised and complex with typically lifted fruitiness: strawberry ice cream pineapple peach balanced by delicate oak bamboo shoot-like delicacy then lemon. The palate is more rounded than that very forward nose with toffee notes adding some weight. A touch of smoke comes along in the mid-palate before fruits and caramelized coffee biscuits. Water allows the flavors to flood the palate. Exemplary blending skills and classically Hibiki."
2820,10,"A little joy from Mount Fuji: soy sauce five-spice powder grilled pineapple halved passion fruit and the umami sensation of slightly salty umeboshi. It’s dense and mouth-coating with maple syrup cinnamon and a steady build of rye spices particularly nutmeg and clove before closing off with dark baked orange. The spices are short lasting but the pleasurably deep boiled orange candy sweetness persists for minutes. (JPY 22000; Not available in the U.S.)"
2821,1,"A rarely-seen cult whisky made by distilling a 100% malted barley mash in a Coffey still and in this expression then aged in a remade hogshead. This is firm and complex on the nose with vanilla pod crème caramel and ripe banana. The palate manages to balance the silky depths and unctuous flow with nutmeg and a light cereal grip. Grain malt or something else? Who cares? Just seek it out. €155"
2822,10,"This whisky spends 7 years in bourbon barrels with a 6-month finish in mizunara. Sandalwood incense long pepper grapefruit cilantro leaf pencil shavings and red pepper rice cracker give this a dry fragrant air. It’s silky with light honey vanilla fudge and peaks with pepper coconut then green apple before a finish of aromatic spices and tangy orange."
2823,10,"Composed of whisky matured in refill American oak first-fill American oak and a single wine cask this light golden dram has mandarin zested lime peeled lychee summer flowers incense cracked black pepper and dried grasses on the nose. With a sweet hit of vanilla red fruit candy spices baked orange and oat cookies it feels stronger than its ABV. Busy spices under the tongue vanilla cream and hints of orange on a lengthy finish. (2117 bottles)"
2824,1,"Now a hugely welcome part of the core range this whisky—made in Coffey stills at the Miyagikyo distillery—uses 100% malted barley as its base. The nose is all tinned peach tropical fruit juice and baked banana with a surprising green celery note coconut and sherbet. The palate is silky with some chocolate biscuity oak and orange blossom honey. Water brings those green notes forward to add freshness to the peach cobbler sweetness. The grain revolution builds. £43"
2825,1,"The first impression is of dried apricot compote pomegranate sweet persimmon a little touch of anise then herbs and strawberry. Quite creamy with fine structure and with water cappuccino and quince jelly. There's a hint of char on the palate to start then the sweetness returns making the mid-palate distinctly peachy with added poached orchard fruits. Broad and quite elegant with a smooth delivery. Water lightens things allowing more floral elements to develop. Versatile."
2826,10,"Brown rice balsamic vinegar hoisin sauce spiced rhubarb white pepper and clove make this an intriguing and appetizing olfactory experience. The palate is fruitier with dark citrus stewed apple star fruit taffy candy and orange Jell-O drifting to light pepperiness and aniseed. A drying aftertaste homes in on orange peel with some late spice contributions. Complex flavor combinations make this a great exploratory whisky for seasoned enthusiasts. (440 bottles)"
2827,1,"The Ichiro of the title is Ichiro Akuto scion of the family which owned the now demolished Hanyu distillery and proprietor of the brand new and incredibly cute (yes…distilleries can be cute) Chichibu distillery — even the name’s cute.
This release is a vatting of different (un-named) single malts from more than one distillery which have been aged in Japanese oak (mizunara or Q.Mongolica). Mizunara has a highly distinctive aromatic spectrum — the Japanese say that it smells of temples specifically the incense which scents Zen temples but while totally accurate that’s not much help if you haven’t been to one. Think of a heavy exotic aroma of allspice sandalwood even redwood and you’re almost there. In fact if you think of the perfumed aspects of rye but turned up a notch then you’re in the right ballpark. In this one there’s even a hint of trail bar — maybe it’s a hike in a California old-growth forest.
The palate is soft and slow to start then picks up mouthwatering acidity — there’s that rye parallel. Green plum and peach balanced with spiciness on the end. Once encountered never forgotten. £85. Price in US dollars was converted at time of review."
2828,1,"The (sadly mothballed) Karuizawa distillery is at the opposite extreme to Eigashima. Peated malt small stills and sherry casks give a single malt of uncompromising weight and solidity. Those of you who thought Japan was all about the ethereal and limpid think again. In musical terms if Eigashima is the Modern Jazz Quarter then Karuizawa is late period Coltrane or if you prefer it’s Black Flag to Eigashima’s Carole King.
Anyhoo did I mention this bottling (like all of this quartet from Number One Drinks) is green? Or at least has a color akin to tarnished silver? The note is all chicory and coffee earthiness and cardamom - whisky reduced to some weird essence by long maturation. The effect is one of an old-fashioned cough medicine (with less laudanum).
The palate is explosive with masses of camphor tar licorice and squid ink. This is Japanese whisky at its most extreme and fainthearts should not venture here. Those with a taste for the big and the bold will love it however. £130. Price in US dollars was converted at time of review."
2829,10,"Rich amber in color with aromas of fermented fruits toasted oak apple peelings old parchment paper golden pancakes and bright aromatic chili flakes and paprika. A soft gentle dram that caresses the taste buds with caramelized brown sugar fudge vanilla dried apple ground almond and a tang of citrus peel. On the finish the flavor of apple peelings returns after a brief glow of spice. (1475 bottles)"
2830,10,"A nose of cola gummies Dr. Pepper fresh green apple poached pears in cream dried strawberry tree blossom white pepper allspice and mint leaves. This whisky finished in a cask with Japanese cherrywood heads begins delicately with sweet fruit syrups before unwrapping golden caramel with a core of spice. Baked apple notes strudel unsweetened citrus and a tang of bitter fruits which abate to a mouth-coating finish of orange oil. (3972 bottles)"
2910,5,"A composite of Tennessee and Kentucky whiskeys finished in sherry butts and port pipes. It’s sherry-forward but rich and layered in roasted nuts caramel dried caramel vanilla cake batter chocolate chamomile and roasted apple. Marzipan and honey flash with hints of hazelnut pear and molasses cookie over a slightly chewy mouthfeel. The medium to long finish gives a slight hint of citrus."
2831,10,"An accomplished blend packed with appealing flavors from Miyagikyo and Yoichi Distilleries. Honey baked lemon vanilla essence brioche golden syrup and spring tree blossom aromas with hints of butterscotch and caramel. Smooth rich and rounded this has toffee chocolate red berry fruit plum vanilla pod a touch of oak char and clipped spices. A flash of peat smoke on the finish with flavors of burnt sugar baked fruits and spices."
2832,12,"Vanilla coconut confectioner’s sugar tart pickled plums and savory meaty aromas thanks to the koji used to convert the rice’s starch to sugar. The palate is sweet and chalky-dry with a silky rounded texture and flavors of vanilla bubble gum coconut and marzipan. It finishes sweet with a touch of umami: vanilla frosting tempered by oak and warm nuts."
2833,10,"This is airily fruity with a greater emphasis on red fruits: strawberry jam red apple and red currant. With greater age the five-spice and ground ginger are dialed up a couple of notches. A thick jammy texture with flavors of red apple malt peppercorn and chili flakes glimpses of chocolate and cocoa though the spices slacken with dilution. Finish of ground coffee cooking chocolate and fading spice. (2160 bottles)"
2834,1,"I tried this alongside the ‘legendary’ 2013 which while good remains too tannic for me. This though has refinement and some complexity with roasted tea scented wood resin new brogues and then the fruity Yamazaki undertow. In time you’ll get perfumed incense-like sherried elements. It’s the finish where things take off into rose petal strawberry and Yamazaki’s pineapple signature. Water increases the tannin. Better than 2013 but still only for sherry bomb and tannin lovers."
2835,10,"Spicy rice crackers plum sauce bramble jelly fragrant oriental spices and the polished leather of new shoes from this single cask sherry-matured rice whisky. The syrupy texture bursts with juicy red fruits plum red currant pomegranate and cooked peach all bolstered by peppercorns and ground ginger. An enchanting harmony is struck between the fruits and the spice though the finish is short with sherry notes and spicy remnants. (660 bottles)"
2836,1,"Last year saw the release of the Yamazaki “component” range examples of the cask types that help make up its single malt releases. Now Hakushu has joined in. The name doesn’t lie this is very smoky heathery fragrant with orris-like dryness alongside Hakushu’s classic vegetal notes of elderflower bamboo and moorland grass. The palate shows praline ripe lychee and kiwi working alongside this mix of integrated smoke and clean focus. It also makes a fantastic Hiball."
2837,10,"The original Iwai pot stills from the 1960s have been retired and now stand outside the Mars Shinshu Distillery. Cajoled by the savory almost gamey aromas assimilated with brown apple and old strawberries the whisky is surprisingly candy sweet to the taste. Dark jellied fruits: first Rowntree’s Fruit Gums then Fruit Pastilles. Hazelnut gentle oriental spices and chicory coffee usher in a deep fruity finish with creamy chocolate and fresh mint."
2838,10,"This is a handy core ingredient for many cocktails combining single malts from Yamazaki and Hakushu with grain from Chita. Dying embers of burnt heather and aromas of sliced apples browning through careless neglect. A complex interplay between the smoky embers roasted spices tiger fruit coriander and whole peppercorn precedes a sweet taste of buttered popcorn orchard fruit and burnished orange supported by increasingly provocative pepperiness. Quaffable and versatile."
2839,10,"Fruit-led on the nose with cherry cola damson plum aromatic spices and coriander seed plus hints of currant and mixed peel. The texture is light with flavors of toffee date brown sugar chocolate cocoa and malty drinks. (U.S. exclusive; 1272 bottles)"
2840,10,"Herbal with roasted sage leaves coriander seed savory meat juices and a twinge of tarragon though there are fruity qualities like fresh peach and clementine. Creamy orange fondant clove peach and nectarine sweetness honey and caramel with a gentle spicy edge makes for a quite charming whisky. It reaches a plateau relatively quickly with just hints of citrus fruit and light spices to finish. (5443 bottles)"
2841,10,"Spring flowers vanilla toasted coconut lime zest and cashew make for an understated nose. Coupled with its delicately light tone this feels like it was designed for sipping while contemplating a zen garden. With Creamsicle coconut orange kumquat and fluttering spices it is further enhanced by dried strawberry raspberry and a spicy aftertaste. Delightfully unhurried development of flavors."
2842,10,"This young whisky from the Mars Shinshu Distillery was matured in Japanese wine casks. Fragrantly aromatic with perfumed florals apple blossom and pastel-colored chalky candy. By way of explanation Rindo means “gentian” the mountain flower of Nagano. Its light texture is rather sweet with caramel mango a piquancy of tart oranges and a little underlying pepper and clove. A snarl of pepper and lingering soft fruits rounds things off. (8200 bottles)"
2843,1,"Suntory’s second distillery was once the largest producer of malt whisky in the world. Located high in the Japanese Alps its buildings are hidden within a thickly forested national park and there is something of that environment in this expression which is filled with the scents of fern wet bamboo pine and mint. Japanese single malt at its most beguiling.£40"
2844,12,"Kiwi guava and jackfruit aromas meld with generous malt ginger and cinnamon on the nose and all carry into the palate which is light-bodied but retains its intense flavor as tropical fruit and toasted grain intersect with spice. Toasted nuts sweet oak a touch of leather and persistent fruit into the finish. Water has an unbalancing effect so add sparingly."
2845,10,"If you are a scotch drinker contemplating your first Japanese rice whisky purchase this is the one. Dates Christmas cake glazed gammon red cherry and muted roasted spices show the quality of the cask. Raspberry coulis and cranberry make for a juicy palate that evolves into caramel fudge chili and pepper. Spices rule the finish the fruit fading quickly. A great introduction to Fukano single casks. (527 bottles)"
2846,10,"This carmine dram has a soft mellow nose of raisin earthy red wine notes wet slate prune flesh stewed rhubarb caramelized brown sugar and maple syrup. It’s fruity rather than sweet on the palate but it seems held back at 40% ABV without a heavier mouthfeel showing date red plum sultana fudge red velvet cake brown sugar and peppery spice with a raspberry and spice finish."
2847,10,"The high-alcohol strength is apparent on the nose which is dominated by pepper clove and star anise spices. A mouth-drawing concoction that begins softly with honey orange and apple peel then grows in scale at the expense of the sweetness. There’s a takeover by root ginger and bitter fruit skins. The long-lasting finish reverberates with crackling spices and sour fruits. (1140 bottles)"
2848,10,"Nutty dried fruits pear and apple light pepper and an old knob of dried ginger. The sherry notes are more reminiscent of amontillado or palo cortado. The sherry works well with the whisky bringing dried peels nuts golden caramels and spicy pepper the latter surging forth to dominate the last remnants of fudge-like sweetness. Attractively tasty this has a finish of juicy peel clove and pepper. (720 bottles)"
2849,10,"One for no age statement naysayers. An eloquent expression of sweet osmanthus baked lemon yuzu violin resin rich malts and bonfire aromas on a favorite woolen jumper. It glides across the tongue with sweet barley sugar but attests to greater depths; grapefruit spicy ginger and mandarin developing milk chocolate-coated candied lemon flavors. A firm finish: green cardamom spices slowly releasing their grip on the front of the palate leaving clingy vanilla. Unbound by an age statement it’s a beautiful offering."
2850,10,"Suntory built Chita Distillery in 1972 to produce a diverse range of corn-based grain whisky styles. This single grain has bright floral aromas with light honey orange and lemon peel freshly unwrapped bubble gum rose water and an edge of spice. Clean pure and moreish this high-quality whisky showcases lychee citrus banana and honey with herbal fringes and a juicy finish. Oh and it’s terrific on the rocks. JP¥3800"
2851,9,"Well-rounded solid malt backbone and very drinkable. These are the main characteristics of this impressive blend. Honeysuckle vanilla-coated malt and fruit (pineapple upside down cake lemon tart plum bramble) are the primary flavors. Ripe barley marzipan beeswax and clove round out the palate. Gentle soothing finish. Suntory can make a 12 year old blend this good with just two malt distilleries? Scotland are you taking notice?"
2852,10,"This is sweeter than Mars Kisoyama with a spicier finish making it a great choice for Highballs and mixing. The nose has ground spices with occasional more aromatic flourishes and hints of whole ginger root and garlic bulb. Some herbal notes in the initial sip but the mouthfeel is delicate and carries pleasant flavors of caramel toffee fresh melon baked apple and a gentle spiciness. (BevMo-exclusive; 6000 bottles)."
2853,10,"This blend is made in Fuefuki west of Tokyo and seems custom-built for great Highballs. The nose presents fresh pear baked pastry straw and slightly smoky roasted spices: coriander seed peppercorn and aniseed ball. It lacks body initially with sweet orange fruit syrups and ginger root spiciness but then it restores your faith with flavors of tropical fruits vanilla and orange cake and a hot ‘n’ spicy peppery finish."
2854,10,"Mandarin segments crystalized pineapple cubes tropical fruits and green apple with a dash of white pepper and ground ginger. This begins with a pleasant supple mouthfeel of vanilla red apple citrus and flitting spices. The mandarin wells up partnered by butterscotch ginger and pepper but then tumbles through flavors of Parma violets gooseberry and pineapple ending up floundering in childhood cough remedies. Lip-puckering sour gooseberry finish bristling with spices. (1000 bottles)"
2855,1,"Yamazaki’s puncheons contain 480 liters and are made at the distillery’s cooperage from American white oak. The greater size means there are lower levels of oak extract immediately apparent in the paler hue and more restrained aromas where flowers mix with the gentle blandness of pear lychee and with water pineapple. Best neat here is distillery character (or one of the distillery characters Yamazaki makes many styles) to the fore. Less immediate than the bourbon barrel but ultimately more rewarding. £70"
2856,10,"A fusion of Japanese and Scotch whisky from the owners of the Mars Shinshu Distillery who have recently opened a second distillery named Tsunuki. Dates treacle red cabbage and maitake mushroom add intrigue. Light-textured sweet and juicy with burnished orange toffee apple dark caramel but some lackluster spices. The texture becomes fatter with dilution as damson flavors emerge. Finish of bonfire toffee flat cola raisins and spice. £75"
2857,10,"This has the warming comfort of cask strength rice pudding with just enough rice character peeking through the sherry. Marzipan sultana fig and toasted spice. Nutty amontillado notes load up on dried fruits including apricot mango and apples pricked with cloves. The late phase includes black cherry old leather cola-flavored candy and burnt fruitcake. A quick fizzle of spice and dried fig turns slightly savory."
2858,10,"This gentler naturally fruity whisky seems to benefit less from the rum than the peated Yoichi the effect particularly heightened on the palate. A nose of warm muffins fruit salad faint citrus the spiciness of fennel and pepper with botanicals in a tropical palm house. Quite spicy it evokes pepper and ginger with pineapple lemon wedges lime ripe melon and some late maltiness. Cinnamon and peppery spice to finish. (3500 bottles; sold as a set with Yoichi Rum Wood Finish 2017) €395/set"
2859,12,"Toddy-like aromas of ginger and honey along with vanilla bean sugared pecans cinnamon allspice apricot and savory koji. The palate is sweet and fruity a cup of Mott’s applesauce with drizzled honey and sprinkles of cinnamon. It finishes with more sweet apples vanilla and caramel. Water not recommended."
2860,10,"Heady with spring blossoms mixed peel cantaloupe green banana and taffy candy with a fine thread of spices running through it. A hesitant opening it wallows in gentle apple and orange before a strong tangerine streak appears the mouthfeel becoming weightier drawing through flavors of peppery herbal salad leaves and vanilla cream. The spices take the lead from then on the fruit fading quickly in the peppery afterglow. (1440 bottles)"
2861,10,"Age adds a richer creamier note suggestive of lighter styles of sherry more fino or manzanilla perhaps a cream sherry. The fruit note is more rounded the nutmeg clove and pepper deliver a stronger kick. Ripe yellow fruits with melon and apple not too sweet followed by a sharper edge of light sherry. By comparison the younger whisky has more fruit to balance out the nippy spices. (720 bottles)"
2862,1,"Herbal-style Miyagikyo with light balsa wood opening into macaroon and peach stone. The sense especially with water is of early autumn unfolding. The palate is very soft with the assured boldness of character typical of the distillery but tempered with a subtle undertow of persimmon and peach. Sweet and lush but with delicacy. €169"
2863,10,"Fragrant spice cherry and gummy bears on the nose though it’s quite subdued. A light mouthfeel of caramel pepper and cherry candies develops a more complex array of spices getting a late lift of fruity sweetness as the spices die out. Passes muster as a Japanese whisky but it’s quite basic for a straight sipper (BevMo-exclusive; 10000 bottles)."
2864,1,"Although only two years older this expression of Hakushu — the first to be launched in the U.S. — shows a fleshier side to the distillery’s wares. While it has retained the freshness of the 10 year old it shows more pineapple and grapefruit on the nose with a little fragrance of jasmine and osmanthus. On the palate it’s fresh and lively with a hint of persimmon and a tickle of smoke. Recommended."
2865,1,"Very bright gold. This shows some of the warm tatami/dry grass notes seen in Yamazaki 12 year old this time overlaid with fruit stones banana chips fresh persimmon and once it opens cask-generated aromas of crème brûlée cinnamon toast caramelized sugar and cotton candy. The palate is sweet and lush with plenty of vanilla ice cream but there’s sufficient acidity to maintain freshness and prevent things from getting too flabby. £70"
2866,12,"Sweet and straightforward aromas of malt cooked apple butternut squash vanilla and pecans sprinkled with dried flowers; water brings out lemon and grapefruit. Graham cracker and vanilla-sweetened pecan on the silky palate along with gingery spice; again water pulls citrus flavors to the fore. There’s more sweet malt toasted oak and chamomile tea on the finish."
2867,10,"Lemon lime ripening apple spring florals clementine and pear among lilting sweet brandy notes. Calming contemplative and restful aromas. The mouthfeel is slightly musty almost granular with creamy light vanilla and juicy lemon and lime. The tip of the tongue burns brightly with warm spices. It grows heavier the tastes shifting to lemon bonbons as the spice is annulled. A dying gasp of lemon peel candy sweetness and aromatic spices."
2868,10,"Masataka Taketsuru first blended Super Nikka in 1962 in tribute to his late Scottish wife Rita and this limited edition pursues the flavors of the original. A dry nose of whole almond honeycomb woody herbal twigs star anise five-spice powder and cut and dried peats. Lyle’s Golden Syrup flavors baked apple and raspberry coulis with a beautifully balanced spicy accompaniment incorporating lemongrass stalks and coconut flakes. Spicy fireworks herbal remnants and a slight peatiness make for a complete whisky. €49"
2869,1,"Distilled as the name suggests in a (Glasgow-built) Coffey still at the Miyagikyo distillery here we have a corn-based grain with masses of gentle custard tart aromas alongside peach and corn fatness. The mouth is ripe and slow with banana skin and fruit peels leading to a mellow mid-palate section where vanilla comes through. It’s all about the feel. €145"
2870,10,"Prunes barbecue seasonings and hoisin sauce sweetened by rich caramel; soak up the heady aromatics. Gloopy texture on the palate explodes into life with burnt orange dried mango and banoffee pie spiraling down to black licorice burnt oak and Brazil nut. The name acknowledges Kiichiro Iwai’s role in ushering in whisky making for Hombo Shuzo in the 1960s drawing on the notes diligently recorded by Masataka Taketsuru in Scotland."
2871,10,"This blended malt has stronger color and flavors than Hatozaki Finest with scents of marzipan orange sherbet lime rind apricot Danish pastry and delicate wood spices. The palate keeps a focus on vanilla fudge and spice but doesn’t really take you on a journey. There’s creamy vanilla a slow burner of peppercorn a little fudge and honey for sure but the anticipated fruitiness never really arrives."
2872,10,"Aromas of grapefruit orange peel and burnt sugar crackling atop crème brûlée with ground almond and tarragon. The texture is mouth drawing and astringent like it’s warping the dimensions of your mouth for its own ends. Dark chocolate and bitter plum transition into cocoa powder and plum pudding with traces of oak. Persistent heat with herbal notes and chili spice on the finish. Leave the water aside. (456 bottles)"
2873,1,"Lifted quite estery and delicate with fruit blossom preserved lemon and light minerality. It needs water; when added out burst blossoms brioche and fondant icing. On the palate there’s a frothy pink party going on: marshmallows flowers raspberry and cream. Water adds silkiness while the finish throws out yuzu then tightens in the manner typical for a young whisky (it’s 3 years old). Not only on the way but getting there. ¥25000/700 ml"
2874,10,"Aged for just 3 years the nose is a fresh fruit salad of green apple honeydew lychee and kumquat. The green fruits and tangy citrus on the palate fall under attack from peppery arugula leaves and active spices. A structure as light as cotton candy; the flavor of orange taffy is all that remains when the dust settles. The finish is dry and peppery with a slight herbal note. (1440 bottles)"
2875,1,"Chibidaru is a Japanese slang term meaning “small” which is appropriate given the size of the cask—quarter-size—used for maturing whisky from a chibidaru distillery. This has the intensity of youth with some lemon meringue pie pomelo and hint of night-scented stocks. As the nose suggests this is a wee (chibidaru) sweetie with mouthwatering citrus character and soft-centered sweetness moving to mace strawberry and a popping candy finish. Akuto-san is making some great whisky. £95"
2876,1,"This blend is soft and quite sweet with low levels of spice and that characteristic Nikka richness behind a classic fist in a velvet glove. Ripe round and generous there’s cocoa and butterscotch with plenty of persimmon and nutmeg. Lush round and balanced; a classic Japanese blend. This will become the core blend in the range and should be appearing in the U.S. hopefully in 2015. ¥5000"
2877,1,"At the moment this is only available through Suntory’s Whisky Shops ‘W’ in Osaka and Tokyo but as these act as mini-testing outlets this grain whisky is one that should be noted. The nose is buttery and needs water to allow a flow of fudge orange peel crème brûlée and green banana. It’s a bit like an alcohol-laced Danish. In the mouth there’s chewy toffee-cream sweetness offset by tart red fruits. A lovely poised grain. ¥3150"
2878,1,"Can you get sweet peat? For that’s what we have here. Very fragrant with delicate wood smoke mixing with citrus and roasted barley. When water is added there’s a mossy note and the sweet warmth of cow’s breath. Continues in this vein in the mouth with the peat now becoming like hot embers. Again citric on the end though more like Amalfi lemon with light bite. Very good. ¥24000/700 ml"
2879,1,"Aged in a mix of sherry and American oak casks this is the latest work in progress from the reopened Mars distillery. The nose is a little closed with some light oak a touch of smoke some fresh barley and light fruit over the sweet core typical of the distillery. Just a touch of plastic indicative of youth. The palate is immediate and bursting with sweetness exotic fruits and clean acidity. Welcome back Mars! £110"
2880,1,"Distilled 2011 bottled 2015. A warming cozy campfire of a nose with everyone swathed in blankets as some hickory bursts into flames. There’s also an iris-like floral note and a vegetal thing at the back. With water a nuance of cereal and wet dog. The palate moves into a rich oily texture then pulls back into hot embers of scented wood and raspberry. The smoke is all-pervading scented but sweet. Water brings out peppermint and smoky bacon. Hugely impressive for a 4 year old. £95"
2911,9,"Back on the market again but with a tweaked formula (a blend of 9 year old bourbon with 10 and 16 year old rye whiskeys). This Bourye sports a rye freshness crispness and zing. Notes of cinnamon and mint are balanced by caramel vanilla and bright glazed fruit with a lingering honey-rye finish. It leans more toward a rye whiskey than a bourbon in flavor profile. Sourced whiskey."
2881,1,"This with finishing time in sherry wood is the most straightforward of the quartet showing lovely touches of Seville orange rather than heavy dried fruits. With water there’s a slight meaty/new leather note that seems a more natural companion to Hanyu’s density here with an extra earthy note from black cherries juniper and star anise. Water triggers tannins but there’s enough fruit here to balance. The most successful of the four with the wood in balance. ¥8500"
2882,1,"Finished off in a 500-liter American oak puncheon this has typical Hanyu robustness with a burnt edge hinting at roasted corn. A little touch of fresh varnish and wax polish adds a savory air before fruits come through: strawberry sloe and plum. The palate is to this mouth very very hot. Water reveals more dense fruit and on the palate there’s plenty of toasted oak stewed rhubarb and dry-roasted peanuts on the finish. A very solid example.¥12000"
2883,10,"A winsome floral nose with icing sugar green tea sweet toffee and juicy fruits including apricot dragon fruit and ripe watermelon. The honey-fruity core of tangerine watermelon orange oils Starburst candies and a little caramel imports attractive flavors the balance and complexity given heft by the white pepper and dried chili notes. The drawback is the lack of body and texture. The end brings a flurry of pepper and burnt oak and a long tail of melon and spices."
2884,1,"Verging on the opaque with a powerful resinous hit bringing to mind a luthier’s workshop with added Morello cherry Turkish delight and bitter chocolate but on the tongue it is surprisingly sweet rather than tannic with a supple feel albeit with dried fruits dominating. This is a great example of what a small amount of heavy sherry can give to a vatting but is it Hakushu? Sherry bomb lovers will adore it. £100"
2885,10,"Spicy and savory with dark soy sauce the blackened bark of a hunk of roasted meat peppercorn fennel and faint lemon zest. Lemon meringue pie and tangerine flavors; quite sweet with lovely flowing spices throughout and a few green notes but when the creamy fudge comes in the ride is over. Compared with the standard blend this has greater balance benefiting from the absence of the more abrasive spices and herbal aromas. Abrupt finish leaving a hollow spiciness behind. £35"
2886,1,"Ichiro loves Japanese oak (mizunara) and here’s a finished example. You need water however to be able to discern those characteristic incense notes. Without it you’re in a world of vanilla and resin. The neat palate is hot but firm with some red fruits and an allspice note. Water is needed and does allow a fresh acidity to come through on the finish; sadly it also adds tannic bitterness. A tricky balancing act. ¥9000"
2887,1,"Ichiro Akuto whose family previously owned the now demolished Hanyu distillery and have five centuries of experience in sake production opened his boutique distillery outside the town of Chichibu just over three years ago. This is the first official release of whisky (rather than new make) and it’s delicious. Lightly scented with touches of lemongrass fennel pollen sweet pear and cookie dough it has lovely balance and weight. Water allows it to spread over the tongue. One to watch. £90"
2888,1,"No doubts from the color what type of cask this is: first-fill sherry. The nose shows masses of bitter chocolate fresh coffee grounds black cherry and molasses cut with humid aromas of damp earth nut and dried fruit. This bittersweet theme continues on the tongue but its sweetness surprises with the spirit pushing the tannins away just enough to reveal itself. If you like savory power this is for you. For me while it’s instructive it’s too grippy.  £70"
2889,1,"Another work in progress from the ever-enterprising Ichiro Akuto. This is made from barley that was malted by him and his team in Norfolk. Unusually for a Japanese malt the aroma is yes malty but it is more chaff-like than nutty. Chichibu’s floral element is there alongside grape must verjus and herbs. The palate is a fascinating mix of the very sweet with balancing dry and sour notes. A distillery that’s growing up fast. £90"
2890,1,"“At last!” they cry. Anchor Distilling is bringing in whiskies from Nikka. I taunted you with the first of the initial brace in 2010 the exemplary Yoichi 15 year old (a hefty 95 points). The second is the firm’s vatted malt Taketsuru 12 year old. A mix of Yoichi and Miyagikyo distillates it is the latter which is to the fore here: a honey-laden mix of cut flowers persimmon vanilla and apple. More are on their way."
2891,1,"Aged exclusively in cognac casks here is Hanyu again showing its thick earth-rooted solidity even to the extent of some rootier elements showing. That said on the nose some water brings out jasmine frangipani and mace with a light buttery note. It’s very spicy on the tongue: nutmeg mixed with bitter roots but as with the Ace of Clubs water just increases dryness. A bit too rigid for me. ¥14000"
2892,1,"The Eigashima distillery on the Akashi Strait near Kobe may be the least well known of Japan’s single malt plants but has a sound claim to be the country’s oldest as its license to make whisky was granted in 1919 — four years before Yamazaki was built. It has however specialized in shochu and even now only turns its hand to whisky making for two months every year. This 5 year old — bottled for independent Japanese specialist Number One Drinks — represents a tentative move into the single malt market once more. Pale in color it shows a typically Japanese cleanliness on the nose that’s cut with a touch of waxiness. It opens with a scented angelica-like lift there’s even a whiff of something like gooseberry jam. As it opens the aroma darkens slightly showing a touch of roasted tea. Water brings out a little yeastiness (typical for some younger whiskies) alongside cucumber borage and lime. The palate is sweet with vanilla custard and a sweet ginger-accented note leading to ripe pear.
A charming malt and already well-balanced for its age. Here’s Japan at its lightest. £55. Price in US dollars converted at time of review."
2893,10,"Like a trip to the stalls of an old spice market the traders beckoning you closer with their colorful wares. Nutmeg fennel seed and caraway on the nose then papery dried oak leaves toast crumbs and slightly pungent notes of chive and shucked pea pods. This is a fatter more glutinous whisky than the single malt. Lemon glaze fudge honey nectarine and kumquat balance an undercurrent of pepper cinnamon and mustard seed. A slightly sour swallow then the spices reign supreme."
2894,1,"Matured in 500-liter port pipes the color is that of a Provence rosé wine. Young but the oak is apparent. Though it’s slightly hot when neat there is distinct raspberry and cranberry fruitiness nettles grass and with water chalk. Sweet on the tip of the tongue there are little glimpses of raspberry fool and some caramelized notes from the cask but it’s not yet fully integrated. £95"
2912,10,"Egon Spengler warned ‘Don’t cross the streams’ and it feels as though the calvados dominates the flavors of Scotch whisky in this rich sweet mash-up. After a nose of vanilla essence and oxidized apple notes the palate brings baked apple brown sugar caramel syrup and clove with lighter vanilla notes rebounding off the sticky apple flavors. Long warming finish with more calvados sweetness and pounding spices. (6028 bottles)"
2895,10,"Age statements are disappearing from Japanese whiskies but this 80% grain content blended whisky from Sasanokawa Shuzo is evidence that age is no substitute for flavor. A tight nose of lychee white pepper allspice and toasted oats is bettered by a sweet light profile yielding American oak characteristics of vanilla and creamed coconut. It’s quickly dominated by intensely spicy seasoning overcoming late notes of burnt orange fresh fig and sour grapefruit peel before a finish of peppered mackerel. (1992 bottles Europe only) €130"
2896,10,"The historic Telser distillery has been producing spirits for generations. Their pride and joy: a triple distilled whisky produced in two wood-fired stills before being matured wholly in French oak barriques that previously contained Pinot Noir. There are overripe melons powdery icing sugar and an unobtrusive jamminess on the nose. The flavorsome palate hits you with bright yellow fruits then twists brilliantly to divulge deep orange and peeled plum skin balanced with gingerbread (available in Lichtenstein Germany Switzerland and online) CHF 290"
2897,4,"Last time we reviewed Telsington it came with a warning. Everything from triple distillation unusual ways of drying the barley and through to Pinot Noir wine casks for maturation is designed to take you from your comfort zone. Not for everyone we wrote. But this is a big step on. There’s an almost bourbon or rye quality to this. There’s burnt toffee and stewed red berries. Deliberately nothing like scotch but we’re starting to see
what Marcus Telser is aiming for. €71"
2898,10,"A sweet nose of barley sugar Refreshers candy ground cumin mown grass and a trace of salt emerge from this triple distilled malt matured in pinot noir and Swiss oak casks. It’s another robust dram from the Principality though after a burst of maltiness it remains a linear experience of spun sugar toffee apples crème brûlée and pomegranate. Water slackens the mouthfeel to reveal soft lemons but this latest release works really well neat. €69"
2899,4,"Brace yourself it's about to get bumpy. Liechtenstein is a tiny principality in central Europe and the Telser distillery sited there takes its whisky very seriously. Every stage from drying the barley over smoke first to the red wine casks used for maturation is designed to make this different from scotch. You'll love it or hate it. The linseed oil nose isn't encouraging but the liqueur-like flavors with fir tree furniture polish and Rumtopf-style fruit compote have their own charm."
2900,5,"This is a batch of 100 barrels of MGP light whiskey an American whiskey using higher distillation proofs and used cooperage. It reminds me of 1980s Crown Royal with floral vibrancy honey and a slight hint of chocolate followed by licorice allspice and vanilla. Its spice hits early and often with balanced black licorice. Blackberry blueberry and ginger come down the final stretch for a nice medium-length finish. Sourced whiskey. (Distillery only)"
2901,5,"A blend of three rye and three bourbon barrels ranging from 10 to 33 years old. Powerful and mouth-coating. Initially a French bakery with caramel vanilla and torched brown sugar dominating. Then more complex notes such as cinnamon roll coconut chocolate slight hints of oak allspice hints of smoked paprika chipotle roasted almond and Polish sweet bread. A long finish offers fruit and nutmeg. Tasty sipper at the perfect proof."
2902,8,"A fascinating flurry of aromas—red fruit punch floral bouquet honey tropical guava and passion fruit and assorted gummy candies. The dense palate balances sweet pineapple upside-down cake with tart ruby-red grapefruit punctuated with lively allspice dark cocoa powder and ginger. The spectrum of bright flavors is underscored by deep spice and polished oak while the impressive impact and skillful blending are spellbinding. Kentucky straight rye whiskey with two Canadian whiskies."
2903,11,"7 year old whiskey (an unspecified “corn rye and malted barley” mashbill “distilled in Indiana”) aged in used barrels. Maple syrup well-browned popovers and Canada mint lozenges in a boozy-hot nose. Richly sweet on the palate: pastry dough hints of anise buttery and slightly-burnt cornbread syrupy dark fruits: complex rich delicious. Water brings out more of the dough and tames the heat. Delicious unique intriguing. Sourced whiskey."
2904,8,"Straight bourbon and rye whiskeys aged from 10 to 14 years this nicely balances its dry oak almost cedary aromas with bourbon sweetness and a rye finish. The initial hit of orange peel caramel and vanilla flan yields to a spicy finish of lemon zest peppercorns and ginger."
2905,0,"An oddball that crosses the divide between American whiskey and scotch by literally mixing the two Campfire combines straight Indiana rye straight Indiana bourbon and peated blended malt scotch marrying them together in heavily toasted French and Hungarian oak wine barrels. The scotch adds hearty meaty flavors to the dry spicy and rich bourbon and rye. This is a robust and beefy whiskey with smoke reminiscent of Southern barbecue. Earlier releases of this ambitious whiskey didn’t quite hit the mark. Now it’s right on target. Number 14 in the 2017 Top 20"
2906,10,"A defiant creation containing 1% 1 year old Girvan grain spirit and 99% malt whisky from Glenlossie Glen Elgin and Linkwood this collaboration celebrates a decade of idiosyncratic and unconventional whisky label designs. It’s warm and effusive with brown sugar on baked apple pie Scottish tablet plus orange and lemon peel. Barley sugar kiwi lime brown sugar cookies pepper clove and a smooth finish of sugar and spice. (4802 bottles)"
2907,5,"With smoke and oak this starts off so intense with pepper spices peat dried apricot hard candies caramel-covered apples salted butter pecan shell and strawberry jam. Leather tobacco and baking spices begin the descent toward a medium slightly bitter finish. If you like trying new things this is an American cadre of flavors unlike anything out there. (Bottled on February 12 2018)"
2908,9,"This is a blend of straight bourbon and two straight rye whiskeys: thus the name. Very interesting indeed. But how does it taste? It’s clean crisp and quite vibrant (especially on the nose). The rye note is evident throughout. It starts out more like a high rye-content bourbon with the molasses caramel coconut cream sweet corn and honey-kissed fruit marrying nicely with the dried spice (vanilla cinnamon brisk mint). But then on the latter half of the palate the rye really kicks in. The whiskey gets bold the rye becomes intense (almost piercing) with a dried spice finish. Some whiskeys are even keeled throughout. This one is more of an adventure. Not complex enough for “classic status” but a very distinctive enjoyable whiskey."
2909,5,"A blend of whiskeys finished in rum and rye barrels it’s molasses-forward with quick introductions of clove vanilla flowers and strawberry. Green apple and ginger cookies appear before a burst of caramel chew herbs and chewing tobacco. At times fascinating for its rye bourbon and rum qualities albeit a little hot it’s a must-pour for a spirits lover."
2913,12,"Distilled from an “aggressively hopped” IPA aged in new charred oak and finished in Islay scotch casks. Cured and grilled meat on the nose—I’m reminded of Lexington NC-style barbecue—along with chicory coffee and apple blossom. Hoppy and piney flavors reveal the beer wash and are joined by orange lemon Pine-Sol pecans chocolate oak black pepper and restrained smoke. The finish brings it all in: smoked oak zingy lemon bittersweet chocolate and hops. This whiskey will have its fans and detractors; in context it offers unique and enjoyable flavors. 396 bottles"
2914,12,"Aromas of smoked meat kelp saline rubber and butterscotch pudding make for a sweet and savory first impression. Flavors of burnt sugar vanilla custard cooked apple dark cacao black pepper and salty umami carry through on a big aggressive hunger-sparking palate. The finish is unsweetened chocolate ash and pepper—bold and unapologetic it responds well to water.

This whisky has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: 18 months;
Processing: Multiple peated malt distillates are aged in Scotland then blended exported and put through Lost Spirits’ reactor with pieces of charred oak treated with Riesling wine."
2915,11,"More nose than on the Reserve (see below); no surprise. Sweet spicy candy alcohol heat and oak. The spicy candy—clove cinnamon allspice—blooms in the mouth firing up oak and corn with a meaty fullness and a warming finish. Quite a bit more complex and interesting than the Reserve. Sourced whiskey."
2916,5,"The mix: 38.5% Bernheim-distilled 17 year old Kentucky straight bourbon 51% 4 year old bourbon and 10.5% 4 year old corn whiskey. Kudos for the full disclosure. This whiskey doesn’t fit in a typical American box. Hard to assess color with used cooperage from corn whiskey so stick to aroma and flavor here. Impressive beginning of fruits roasted nuts citrus vanilla cherry spice and undercooked cornbread followed by a quick caramel burst. Tasty even better with a splash of water."
2917,5,"When you close your eyes and think of an American whiskey this is what it smells like: leather caramel vanilla oak and a hint of smoke. It becomes ever more interesting with introductions of citrus baked fruit and a hint of oregano; and then the baking spice and pepper follow the finish home."
2918,12,"An aggressive punch of peat—creosote tar rubber and seaweed—mingles with wood spice butterscotch vanilla pudding and red apple on the nose. The palate shows charred meat charred wood earthy smoke crème brûlée and red apple flavors. The short ashy finish satisfies with dark chocolate and black pepper. At such a high proof it takes water well and develops in the glass.

Processing: Multiple peated malt distillates are aged in Scotland then blended exported and put through Lost Spirits’ reactor with pieces of toasted oak treated with Riesling wine."
2919,8,"A blend of American rye Canadian rye and port. Gentle spice and sweet vanilla appear on the nose but the impression of browning apple wet leaves and oxidized red wine are somewhat dreary. Simple and sweet up front it feels thin like fake maple syrup with more sweet vanilla carried on a rather light body almost resembling some rice whiskies."
2920,5,"Finished in barrels that once held nocino a walnut liqueur. This whiskey immediately offers chocolate oak leather vanilla roasted pecans and smoke-fired marshmallow. Then port oatmeal stout cherry cola nutmeg applesauce roasted nuts and caramel. The final notes are soft but an extremely short finish erodes the palate’s promise."
2921,12,"Not a rum cask-finished rye but a blend of Kentucky straight rye with Canadian rye and added blackstrap rum. The experience is sweet from start to finish: Sugar Babies and their parent Sugar Daddy on the nose along with molasses raisins kettle corn maple donuts toasted marshmallow and a little grassiness on the nose. The palate is sugary-sweet with molasses pralines coffee ice cream Raisinets and some bitter oak and it finishes short. Keep an eye on your blood sugar when drinking this."
2922,11,"Shy nose: some cornbread and spicy candy. Whooshes into the mouth though with a lively sweet and spicy rush followed by herbal notes: woodruff fresh marjoram meadow grass. The finish becomes drier finally showing a bit of oak then drying to a powdery medicinal astringency. Almost more like a tonic than a whiskey. Sourced whiskey."
2923,4,"Proof there is life after Cooley. Jack Teeling and whiskey innovator Alex Chasko kept the independent flame alive by moving on. This whisky isn't a revolution: it's a mix of Irish (Cooley) and scotch (Bruichladdich). That's not a new idea and it does what you might predict. It starts with a sweet fruity Irishness then earthier spicier Scottish notes kick in. It works fine but this is a placeholder whisky. Expect a lot more in the coming months."
2924,11,"Not cheap sugar “squeezins” this is mashed from 50% corn and 50% cane sugar run on an alembic still by two Beams whose great-grandfathers were J.W. Dant and Minor Case Beam: some credibility. Clear as glass a big corn nose tinged with light caramel and violets. Nicely sweet and warm grassy-fresh and east to hold in the mouth. Clean straightforward stuff."
2925,4,"I'm really excited that new world whiskey makers and independents are challenging the way we think about whiskey. But there are concerns too such as flavored whiskeys and white spirit sold as the finished article. Poitín is an Irish pauper's spirit made illegally so legal definitions are patchy. It is normally made with potatoes. This is a mix of new make Irish single malt and new make Irish grain. It tastes like new make Irish whiskey. End of story."
2926,11,"Smells kind of…Canadian. Light caramel sweet candy and a bit of oak. Light and sweet on entry; not cloying with some hints of vanilla and fresh-sawn cedar. Body seems to thicken as it hits the tongue and the finish spreads and hangs: sweet with that very light cedary note. Simple sweet but not overly complex. Sourced whiskey."
2927,5,"Straw to light tawny. This blend of straight American whiskeys comes alive with wood floral citrus and cola. The taste presents a heftier body than the 40% ABV suggests with hints of coffee nutmeg and cornbread. This has a warm astringent finish that gives cinnamon caramel and grain. Leaves me wanting more from the experience. Sourced whiskey."
2928,5,"This composite includes 28 year old barrels that yielded a flavor profile similar to pre-Prohibition blends. Smoke mint herbs dandelion chamomile and horehound. Earthiness warms the palate with a slight hint of whole-grain toast. A medium finish shows a bit of black licorice. This style is so reminiscent of early 1900s whiskeys that it’s a must-pour for a palate history lesson. You just don’t taste these notes elsewhere."
2929,5,"Youth and rawness offer the first impression with fresh-cut oak and grains leading the way. The raw grains develop into cooked-oat notes followed by rye toast tobacco oak smoke and an unwanted bitterness that lingers. The short finish offers a hint of caramel and citrus. Price is per 375 ml."
2930,11,"A blend of bourbon and rye whiskeys 2 years old no information on the proportions. Very hot piercing nose: wet corn tobacco juice peppermint oil and pain. Man that’s hot. Bitter and hot on the tongue with an inappropriate sweetness. Finish backs off on the heat but is full of wet oak. Can’t help thinking this was simply a bad idea."
2931,5,"Sourced whiskey from MGP it’s fairly muted with hints of dill oregano basil sawdust hay and mint. Then vegetal cherry cough syrup and candy corn notes over cola maple and oak. Traces of baking spices appear just before sweet syrup over an extremely short finish. Although many notes appeared none were particularly pronounced."
2932,10,"Double distillation in stainless steel produces a higher filling strength than single distillation which may account for the naturally dark color and rich flavors here. From Masahiro Distillery this carries caramelized sugars orange oil blackberry allspice ground ginger and dried pineapple on the nose. Flavors of dark fruits cocoa powder chocolate plum cherry blackberry and pepper; more body and intensity than other Shibui and it gets deliciously nuttier as it dilutes."
2933,10,"Aromas of fresh orange peel burst with tart acidity mixed with milk chocolate stone fruit peppercorns chile flakes five spice and red Twizzlers. A lithe and supple character of mandarin and runny caramels on the palate with elements of walnut and gentle spices then developing greater tanginess creaminess and red berry fruits. Longevity is quite attainable with rice whiskies though don’t expect them to match the body and texture of 30 year old malts."
2934,0,"This hybrid of bourbon rye and blended malt scotch is the dusty trail made liquid flesh. Smoke and cooked meat up front balanced by sizzling rye spice red fruit and dark chocolate. Seaweed salt spray and peat are happy to share the spotlight. Barbecue ribs dry-rubbed with paprika chili powder and clove with a smoldering finish. Hot powerful and beguiling. A great improvement over earlier releases (2016 batch)."
2935,12,"High West has changed the recipe for Campfire to include its own-make rye along with sourced rye bourbon and peated malt whisky from Scotland. The nose is sweetly spiced and subtly smoky with Lapsang souchong tea kelp beach bonfire cigar box orange peel cinnamon white pepper and crème brûlée. Sharply herbal at first taste it warms up to reveal orange oil cherry cola cough syrup cigar wrapper iced tea roasted walnuts caramel and savory smoke. Chili heat on the finish is balanced by oak dark chocolate tobacco and grilled apple."
2936,10,"The combination of mature single malts from Lowlands Scotland and Niigata Japan that have been double distilled in pot stills works well here. This has a copacetic nose of dry spices pepper sandy seashells and Whoppers but it’s the comforting warming flavors—applesauce cream malted chocolate-chip cookies cinnamon brown sugar and spiced gingerbread—that really unmask its full potential."
2937,10,"Manzanilla and fino casks were selected to mature this elegant single-distilled rice whisky from Shinzato Distillery instilling it with delicate sherrywood flavors of plum flesh damson jam dried apricot sticky dates and fine dry spices. This builds slowly on the palate so don’t rush it: citrus zest peppery spice clove orange Jell-O mixed peel and dried apricot before departing with a long lingering aftertaste."
2938,10,"This blend of Scottish and Japanese grain whiskies matured in bourbon oloroso sherry and mizunara oak offers a nose of baked lemon aniseed gently roasted spices crispy roast chicken rock pool minerality and sandalwood. Light bodied floral with lemon and lychee then greater complexity develops as juicy mandarin dried apricot and tropical fruits emerge while peppercorn mounts a rearguard action leaving a citrus and ground-ginger finish"
2939,10,"Shibui’s only bottling from Kumesen Distillery is single distilled in a stainless steel still and matured in manzanilla and fino casks. More oakiness on the nose with milk chocolate dried cranberry slightly bitter cherry notes hints of toffee and muted wood spices. Citrus freshness vanilla fudge gingersnap spiciness licorice walnut and fresh fig with a finish of lime and green melon imply the influence of the lighter-style sherries."
2940,10,"Ripe fresh-fruit aromas of watermelon strawberry red gooseberry fresh plum and coconut strips with a hint of orange peel singed over a flame. This whisky was double distilled in stainless steel at Masahiro Distillery and tastes gently fruity with blueberry black currant juice red fruits stewed apple clove and pepper tempering to cranberry and orange then a flare of spice over orange fondant to signify the finish."
2941,10,"Single distilled in Shinzato Distillery’s stainless-steel still the nose is replete with bourbon-barrel character including vanilla honey toasted oak generous wood spices fresh cream and lemon zest. The mouthfeel is light with honey maple syrup vanilla a slight nuttiness glazed doughnuts ground ginger and pepper with hints of milk chocolate on the finish."
2942,10,"Bourbon oloroso sherry and mizunara oak casks were used to mature this blend of double-distilled Lowlands single malts from Scotland and Japanese single malts. The nose is dry and spicy with crushed nuts coriander seeds mizunara spiciness and salted peanuts. Starts like a fishtailing car before finding its grip then delivers caramel bitter orange boiled fondant sherry fruitiness mango malt pepper and clove with the spiciness enduring through the finish."
2943,12,"A blend of Canadian whisky with 1% sherry and 8% bourbon. Dried and stewed fruits baking spices leather and earthy tobacco blanket light-bodied vanilla sweetness. Assertive dark chocolate and coffee raisins and prunes are balanced with sweet peppered jerky. The generous sweetness is tempered with water. Finishes like a Cadbury Fruit & Nut bar but with more personality."
2944,12,"Delicate aromas of chamomile marigolds gardenias peaches apples and vanilla undergirded by biscuity cereal notes transition seamlessly to an elegant palate of vanilla green apples malted milk balls and fresh herbs. The finish has gentle spice that fades into warm chocolate with continuing creamy grain. A blend of Japanese and other whiskies that responds well to water."
2945,12,"A 5 to 8 year old blended scotch married for 3 years in sherry casks in Scotland and finished for 12 months in Pedro Ximenez casks in Jerez. The nose has luscious figs raisins molasses and berries brightened with apricot-tangerine notes when water is added. The palate is intense: Fig Newtons dark chocolate raisins and orange peel finishing with honey Raisinets and chocolate-covered nuts—a soft slightly under-proofed conclusion but still satisfying."
2946,12,"Grassy grainy and floral on the nose with hints of citrus grape soda and apples. The palate is creamy fruity sweet and light with creamed corn milk chocolate and grassy and floral notes. There’s a hint of spice and a milk chocolate finish. An interesting flavor profile but the blend of bourbon and Irish single malt whiskey never quite comes together as a cohesive whole."
2947,0,"A blend of Highlands scotch Canadian whisky and high-rye whiskey from Seattle’s Oola Distillery with an additional year of aging in cabernet sauvignon barrels. The wine influence is apparent with plum cherry and raspberry on the nose. French vanilla dusty oak white chocolate and stone fruit dominate a creamy and mellow palate. Poached pears honey and cornbread flavors bring a little too much sweetness and lack depth."
2948,2,"From Restless Spirits of Kansas City Missouri a blend of 4 year old Irish whiskey and their own-make pot still whiskey. A gentle nose of pine bough fennel seed citrus oil licorice and potpourri with a veneer of lemon candy. The palate tastes young but sweet and creamy blending vanilla bitter orange and spicy pepper with a raisiny Chunky bar note and chocolate-covered almonds. Finishes with more chocolate orange and a subtle nuttiness."
2949,0,"A blend of Highlands scotch Canadian whisky and house-made high-rye whiskey. Aromas of stewed red fruit pomegranate and mint hold promise but the whiskey is quiet with subtle peach unripe raspberry apricots and white flowers. White chocolate cornbread and biscotti flavors add a good deal of sweetness. The finish is pleasant and rounded. An interesting experiment but it’s hard to discern what each component brings to the table."
2950,10,"This 100% rye has a beautifully developed nose of roasted coriander seed white pepper and Cinnamon Toast Crunch though the spices dominate and impede other characteristics from shining through. The initial mandarin and tropical-fruit sweetness is left behind as the peppery spices roar away. The finish sees the spices vanish into thin air as if teleported back to the mother ship. Ideal for rye-based cocktails."
2951,4,"A single cask cask strength 16 year old malt from the demolished Willowbank distillery to celebrate the New Zealand All Blacks World Cup victory and further evidence that New Zealand is back on track. This is whisky hitting its stride. Creamy and honeyed with a cracked lemon pepper undercoat it's fresh and very drinkable with a delightful sugar and spice combo running through it. Oak only really makes an appearance in the finale. NZ$229"
2952,4,"Rugby union fans will recognize the name and spot that 1987 was the last time the New Zealand All Blacks won the world cup. Bottled for this year's tournament it's 24 year old whisky from the demolished Wilson distillery in Dunedin and it's a rarity — very good New Zealand malt. It's not unlike the Shackleton — big lemon and smoke notes a pear and apricot heart lots of oaky spice and a delicious aniseed rancio conclusion. $NZ 299"
2953,4,"What a surprise this is! After a steady run of aged and just about agreeable dusty lemon and paprika malts this is the youngest release—just 8 years old—from the now-demolished Wilson distillery. At a guess I'd say the original whisky was ordinary so the Tasmanians who own the stock did what Tasmanians do and finished it in port casks to make it fruity. The blemishes aren't entirely ironed out but the whisky gets away with it—and this is rather good and at a better strength. Why bottle premium malt at 40% and your 8 year old at 44%? NZ$79"
2954,4,"Mat and Rachael Thomson run a small hands-on whisky business moving toward a sizeable and successful whisky business. Truth be told much of what's left from the Willowbank distillery is average. This isn't. It's an example of just how good the distillery could be with citrus at its heart plus gutsy and prickly savory notes and some salt and pepper to fill it out. Later on there's a trace of spearmint and even menthol. NZ$142"
2955,4,"Eighteen years? Really? In what? If you're a fan of big oak don't stop here. All the wood seems to have added is a muddy earthy note to what is a good whisky struggling to keep its head above water. There's tart lemon meringue in the mix and creamy crushed hazelnut an array of spices and some bread dough. But the earthiness is a distraction. Overall a bit of a confused kiwi. NZ$126"
2956,9,"A cask from some of the last remaining stocks of whisky from New Zealand’s Wilson distillery. A very unpretentious creamy-sweet malt (fresh vanilla honey) with subtle floral notes mint and hints of smoke. A bit youthful in character-especially on the finish. I think two to five more years on oak would enhance this whisky and provide additional depth and smoothness but it is quite enjoyable right now at ten years old."
2957,4,"The Doublewood experiment highlighted above may be the way forward for what's left of this old New Zealand stock because having tasted several samples now and presumably the better ones there's a pattern emerging. The core whisky is fine with tangy lemon and earthy pepper but the casks clearly weren't great and they throw up inconsistencies. This is fine as far as it goes—until you see the price tag. This is $120 in American dollars. Nor is it as good as the Rugby World Cup 16 year old Vindication bottling.  NZ$148"
2958,4,"This is from the stock of aged Willowbank whisky that  was marketed under the Milford label before ending up as whisky from Thomson. You following this? It’s sweet with an attractive soft melon center but sharp pepper kicks in and coats the mouth staying forever."
2959,4,"Thomson is a small independent New Zealand whisky company with a limited amount of stock originally distilled at the Willowbank distillery and this is as young as New Zealand whisky currently gets. One suspects it would have benefited from a couple more years but its simple sugar and spice combo and rich citrus heart make it an uncomplicated but very drinkable session malt. It's a waltz of a whisky that kicks a bit at the death. NZ$85"
2960,4,"Thomson has discovered and bottled stocks from the Willowbank distillery which closed in the 90s. It was almost certainly the world’s most southern distillery located at Dunedin a South Island city populated by Scots (the name is an amalgam of Dundee and Edinburgh). The whisky? Not bad at all. Sweet edgy prickly with pineapple and kumquat banana and salt and pepper."
2961,4,"Kaiapoi is a small town in North Canterbury New Zealand and was in the frontline of the recent horrific earthquake that wrecked this pretty part of the south island. Made by distiller John Fitzgerald and matured for 13 years this whisky has been something of a secret. It tastes like nothing else on earth. It’s like Germany’s Blaue Maus — working off a different template than scotch. Imagine sweet alcoholic hazelnuts giving way to spice. Lacks depth though."
2962,10,"Styled as the Original Moonshine these aromas whisper of sweet summer fruits golden barley and potato farls. There is no lightning bolt of alcohol sipping at 40% ABV but it is smooth and pleasantly tasty; flavors of melon apple and sugared biscuits finishing with a barley tickle around the gums. A versatile addition to your cocktail armory from West Cork Distillers of Skibbereen but I found it lost much of its appeal poured over ice."
3074,8,"A characterful if peculiar whiskey that suggests younger rye. Horehound citronella oil scented geranium and lemon balm contribute to an intensely herbal slightly antiseptic aroma. There is a compelling bitter edge to the flavor like biting into orange peel while the finish is intensely woody and mouth-coating. Not for everyone but quite captivating and flavorful."
2963,9,"Surprisingly lively. Very much like the 21 year old release in this regard but not as spicy on the nose or palate. Instead the spice is replaced by a layered satisfying sweetness -- not by wood like the somewhat lethargic oak-dominated 23 year old release. Older doesn’t mean that it tastes older. Deep nutty toffee foundation with nougat candied tropical fruit and shoo-fly pie. The spices (cinnamon spearmint vanilla cocoa powder) emerge mid-palate and linger warming the finish. Not as vibrant as the 21 year old expression but more sophisticated. I can’t speak for the other barrels in this lot but I think this one is a great example of what a 20-plus year old rye whiskey should taste like."
2964,9,"Deep amber color. Bold and surprisingly youthful aromas and quite vibrant for its age-huge spicy notes (mint cinnamon vanilla anise freshly ground pepper) with rich toffee caramel and background fruit. Rich enveloping body. Enormous in flavor with youthful dynamic spices (mint cinnamon vanilla pepper) wrapped in rich toffee and molasses tamed by mature oak and leather notes. The flavors intensify on the palate ultimately reaching a crescendo. The boldness of the spices and maturity of age dovetail perfectly. Its finish is very satisfying and seemingly eternal."
2965,9,"Just what the category was missing -- a stellar young barrel-proof rye whiskey. Hugely spicy with piercing mint fiery cinnamon vanilla coconut and fennel. Underlying notes of caramel honey and Seville orange provide some civility. It has more zing and richness than other young rye whiskeys and it lacks the tired woodiness of the majority of the older rye expressions on the market. A clean powerful vibrant whisky that is a must for any rye enthusiast."
2966,9,"The first rye whiskey I have tasted to rival the Sazerac Rye 18 year old. This is a great whiskey from beginning to end. Soothing layers of sweetness (vanilla maple syrup cookie dough toffee) are balanced by candied fruit and waves of spice (mint cinnamon nutmeg cocoa powder).l The palate is clean the flavors are deep the spices are well-defined and there’s not one hint of excessive or tired oak. A bench-mark rye. (A Ledger’s Liquors exclusive.)"
2967,9,"Very similar to last year’s release. Well rounded with a gently sweet foundation (toffee vanilla taffy) pleasant spice (cinnamon mocha soft evergreen) date glazed citrus bramble and a gentle finish for a rye. A classic ultra-aged rye whiskey."
2968,5,"This is High West Rendezvous Rye finished in port and French oak barrels. It is a campfire pour. An arsenal of smoke spice and sweet alternating back and forth. Just when you think the nuance ends pronouncements of chocolate cinnamon plum pepper spice and barbecue. Its complexity hits a homerun offering honey red fruits and citrus to a lingering tickling spicy finish. A must have. Sourced whiskey."
2969,9,"A perennial classic. Not aggressively bold like its younger sibling (Thomas H. Handy) but this is a rye of distinction and class. Still quite vibrant for its age with plenty of spice (cinnamon soft evergreen vanilla hint of nutmeg) softened and balanced by sweet notes (caramel toffee) glazed citrus and dried oak on the finish. This remains the benchmark for what a mature rye whiskey should taste like."
2970,5,"Just beautiful. Long rounded notes of caramel cinnamon roll taffy butterscotch brisket burnt ends nutmeg Jamaican jerk plum pudding ginger light sassafras root beer roasted marshmallow cotton candy orange peel raw honey and pie crust. If it sounds complex it’s because it is and the finish just doesn’t quit giving you a lingering taste of every note."
2971,9,"This is a good as rye whiskey gets. It’s powerfully spicy yet there is a calming sweetness along with soft berry and citrus fruit behind the spice. I find its oily texture very soothing and this also marries beautifully with the spice from the rye and the resinous oak. The flavors are crisp and incredibly clean and the 18 years in oak has added formidable depth."
2972,9,"(Previously reviewed in Vol. 15 No. 1.) A wonderfully crisp clean rye for 18 years old (or any age for that matter) with incredible depth and balance. A perennial classic."
2973,9,"Very mellow silky in texture and on the sweet side for mature bourbon. It’s not bold like Parker’s Heritage Collection 27 year old which has much more oak spice and resin. Willett’s foundation of molasses and toffee is accentuated by candied fruit fig dusty corn and tobacco with mint tea cinnamon and vanilla peppered throughout. It’s perilously drinkable. I am impressed how these 20-plus year old Willett rye and bourbon whiskeys maintain their balance and keep the oak in check. Splendid ultra-mature bourbon. (Less than 100 bottles of this were sent to California and not all the same barrel. Happy hunting.)"
2974,9,"A blend of two whiskeys; a 6 year old made from 95% rye and a 16 year old made from 80% rye.  These are very high percentages; a straight rye whiskey only needs to contain 51% rye to meet the definition.  It was very clever to marry the vibrancy of a younger whiskey with the depth of a mature whiskey.  Thanks to the high rye content this whiskey is very spicy with cinnamon crisp mint and fennel.  Underlying sweet notes of caramel molasses vanilla macaroon cocoa and candied fruit provide a calming effect and enhance the whiskey's complexity.  But in the end the rye is the victor emerging with a vengeance and giving the whisky a bold warming spice finish."
2975,9,"A benchmark rye whiskey which has been stored in stainless steel tanks the past several years to prevent excessive aging while new batches mature. This is the last of the “tanked” stock. Soft and teasing for a rye whiskey but perfectly balanced. Gentle toffee and molasses provide a foundation for interwoven clove mint and cinnamon. Delicately dry lingering finish. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2015 Release."
2976,9,"This was my second lowest rated whiskey from the 2009 Collection (a 91 rating). This one is an impressive whiskey and an improvement from last year. It’s soft (for a straight rye) well rounded and easy to embrace with tamed spice (cinnamon mint vanilla mocha) nougat toffee fruit (bramble subtle citrus) subtle date and polished leather on the finish. Buffalo Trace is playing a shell game with this aged rye (being stored in stainless steel tanks over the past several years until new stocks mature) but in this instance there seems to be a prize under every shell. Well done! (Editor's Choice)"
2977,13,"Sweet bakery notes jump off the nose: globs of vanilla gooey chocolate brownies wet walnuts and almond cream. The whiskey further develops with aromas of incense oil lemon curd and new leather. On the palate there is an increased spiciness that really pops supported by maple syrup and mint leaf. The finish is nutty with excellent length showcasing maturity beyond the age statement. The bold flavor and big proof here benefit from a splash of water to bring a mosaic of flavors into better focus."
3007,9,"One of the best Handy offerings yet. Very vibrant with dynamic spice (firm mint warming cinnamon allspice hint of clove) and lush fruit (citrus orchard fruit golden raisin brandy and teasing coconut) all tamed by a bed of soothing caramel and honey. It’s not easy for a whiskey to come across as excitingly youthful yet nicely matured. It’s a difficult balance to achieve but this whiskey pulls it off. Editor's Choice"
2978,12,"Pure panache: roasted cinnamon allspice berries baking chocolate dried cherries grape jelly and polished oak on the nose; with time aromas of nougat and almond. More chewy dried cherries and grape fruit leather on the palate along with zippy cinnamon paprika black pepper and a hint of mint. Dark chocolate tobacco and plenty of oak add support especially after water is added. More dark fruit and dark chocolate on the finish as well as persistent oak that swerves pleasantly into leather."
2979,8,"This limited-edition rye from Knob Creek beat the odds to rise to number two by flexing its muscle to impress tasters from both the U.S. and the UK. Superlatives were in good supply: intense massively chewy huge very bold aggressive. This 9 year old unfiltered cask-strength bottling simply presents heaps of flavor for a fair price. Caramel-drizzled flan charred marshmallow and honey-roasted peanut aromas lead to mouth-filling flavors of tropical fruits citrus oil and peach nectar. Lemony bright with cinnamon and peppery spice galore it’s surprisingly drinkable at proof but water really unpacks the flavors. Number 2 in the 2018 Top 20"
2980,3,"A seamless fusion of rain-moistened earth gunnysacks and searing white pepper underpins the delicately bitter grain-like notes of fresh-baked rye bread. Lilacs and violets speak of rye grain as do delicate cloves and tingling ginger while dark stewed fruits attest to age. A mingling of hand-selected barrels of 10 year old all rye whisky Masterson’s is redolent of vintage car leather and kiln-dried burley tobacco with touches of dry herbs and spearmint. Sweet vanilla envelops early butterscotch."
2981,9,"Incredibly soft and mellow for a rye whiskey with no signs of excessive oak. This whiskey is obviously of the same pedigree as the Willett Rye 22 year old bottling reviewed here a year ago. It’s another impressive whiskey. Light toffee nougat and rummy notes are accentuated by crisp mint cinnamon nutmeg and Earl Grey tea. Pristine on the palate with lingering cinnamon warmth on the finish. A polished whiskey with surprising subtlety and finesse. At 137 proof it’s like getting a third of a bottle free!"
2982,5,"This sings a tune of balance with caramel coconut chocolate barrel char and campfire smoke harmonizing at the opening. Next comes an amazingly complex series of herbal notes: dill oregano and thyme. That’s when cinnamon bread coffee and crème brûlée take over; each note super concentrated and rounded. The long finish presents a hint of cinnamon. This is a must-have sipper. (450 bottles)"
2983,12,"Rare Breed bourbon enjoys notoriety as a great value and this new rye stands shoulder to shoulder with it. A gift for Wild Turkey fans from master distillers Jimmy and Eddie Russell it’s not chill-filtered making it even more full-bodied and rich. Zesty aromas of mint eucalyptus pine and cedar chest mingle with sliced orange candied strawberry and sweet pecans on the nose and that profile carries over into the nutty spiced herbaceous and citrus-sweet flavors of the palate. With water the full spectrum of flavors—and the harmonious interplay of grain and barrel—reveal themselves leaving an unforgettable impression of perfectly controlled power. Number 5 in the 2020 Top 20"
2984,8,"Elijah Craig always impresses with value but until now has been confined to bourbon. This foray into rye whiskey sticks close to Elijah Craig’s bourbon roots by using only the minimum-required 51% rye in its formulation; however it does achieve a nice departure in flavor. Aromas include butterscotch caramel-nut clusters and peppery spice. The spice ramps up on the palate carried forward by the full body hearty proof and mouth-coating texture as cherry cola baking chocolate and darker fruits emerge. Priced a notch below comparable peers this rye delivers powerful flavors that feel excitingly untamed and will impress bourbon and rye lovers alike. Number 7 in the 2020 Top 20"
2985,12,"Complex from the start with a nose of roasted nuts and dark fruit—blueberry pie grape jelly—along with bundled herbs fresh-brewed iced tea and weathered barn boards. Mint cinnamon pepper concord grape jelly peanuts and black tea swirl on the palate which is full and robust thanks to the absence of chill-filtration. Without water it finishes hot but the oak roasted nut and tiramisu flavors help retain balance. Editors' Choice"
2986,12,"Concord grape juice leather armchair cola syrup iced tea roasted pecans and furniture polish on the nose. The palate is deeply fruity with cooked cherries blackberries Concord grape jelly Coca-Cola dark chocolate silky baking spice and white pepper with a lush and velvety texture. A complex finish of bitter chocolate peanut shell Dr. Pepper and leathery oak rounds things out."
2987,12,"There’s much to discover in the depths of this glass which continues to develop over time. Dark fruit tobacco orange pekoe tea white pepper leather dry-roasted peanuts and varnish unfold on the nose while the palate is fruity with blackberry raspberry blueberry and orange; it also has dry oak nuts tobacco and a lot of black pepper spice. The finish is leathery and peppery with cigar and persistent dark berry flavors. A dense decadent whiskey that makes it all seem effortless. (12000 bottles)"
2988,8,"The vanilla and oak-driven nose offers layers of stone fruits golden raisin tropical fruit and citrus zest along with hints of espresso violet and fresh herbs. On the palate this is so dialed in! Laser-like in its delivery of sweetness and spice it rings clean and bright and simply sizzles with candied ginger warmth before the finish pours on cocoa and nutty flavors. Tastes wonderfully mature yet full of vigor."
2989,2,"A limited-edition release of Boxergrail Rabbit Hole’s 95% rye aged 6 years and bottled at barrel proof. Powdered sugar glazed donuts candied nuts cherry blackberry and vanilla custard punctuate the nose. A rich spiced palate offers notes of grape jelly and allspice while water unlocks semi-sweet chocolate licorice honey-coated almonds and toasted oak. A long finish anchored by balanced oak offers raspberry tart baking spice maple syrup and tiramisu."
2990,12,"The nose has vanilla galore along with nuts milk chocolate cooked cherries orange oil cinnamon and iced tea; water highlights the grain to great effect. Chewy and textured in the mouth with plenty of chocolate peanuts cinnamon nutmeg ground ginger and cayenne pepper plus lively orange zest. It finishes lengthy and satisfying: dark chocolate and that orange zest integrating seamlessly with cinnamon brown sugar and polished oak."
2991,11,"Redemption repeats their barrel-proof MGP-sourced 95% rye now at 7 years old. Has a year significantly changed last year's 90-point outing? Oak is more subdued and the pepper floats on sweet light caramel. It is still quite nice at full-bore no water needed. Sweet vanilla and bitter rye oil blend surprisingly well; this is hitting the bells and it's better integrated. Big swaggering and sporting big-barrel maturity. Can go toe-to-toe with almost any rye out there."
3025,9,"Distilled in 2008 this is always the youngest whiskey in the Collection. The boldest and spiciest too! A blast of mint clove and cinnamon leads the spice charge with fig dates caramel-coated nuts vanilla and candied fruit. Well-integrated flavors and a smart balance of youth and maturity."
2992,12,"A welcome addition to the Elijah Craig family this rye has rock-solid heft and flavor that doesn’t quit. The nose swells with cooked blackberries and raspberries fruit leather iced tea cola and stately oak. It’s chewy and viscous on the palate with more berries and grapes (often jammy) well-integrated oak dark chocolate and lush spice. The finish rides a long way on peppery dark fruit wet walnuts dark chocolate and rich oak. Editors' Choice"
2993,11,"Redemption delivers a 10 year old barrel proof rye (sourced from MGP); the bottled whiskey is mingled from only six barrels. Nose of hot bitter rye spice and caramel with oak. Great whambam! feel of sweet whiskey followed immediately by oily spicy rye which then controls the flavor and finish without dominating. Not over-oaked and these older MGP barrels are finally showing what 95% rye can do. At 6 years it could be a high-rye bourbon; this simply shouts rye. Fascination."
2994,2,"A delightfully complex nose of vanilla hot cross buns and bakery shop cherries coconut raisins figs licorice old leather and hay barn. A smooth viscous palate offers lemon honey fragrant oak cigar ash dark berries and more coconut. Spicier notes emerge with water while the finish offers rich smoothness with spiciness chocolate-covered coconut tobacco and bitter herbs. Lots of depth and complexity. A great whiskey to enjoy with a cigar."
2995,13,"Demonstrating clear maturity and complexity this is sweet right off the bat with cocoa-dusted truffles dark chocolate-covered cherries crème brûlée and gingersnap cookie on the nose. The palate is chewy with more dessert notes like tiramisu mocha and candied apple in addition to tobacco leaf and with water dried ginger allspice and raisins. The finish displays savory spices cocoa powder espresso peppermint stick and blueberry jam with excellent length."
2996,12,"This rye finished in virgin Spanish oak and Brazilian teakwood barrels has a delicious nose full of vanilla extract fresh-baked dough cinnamon and nougat. It’s consistent on the palate balancing the sweetness of marshmallow and vanilla frosting with licorice tea mint and toasted oak. More toasted oak cinnamon and brown sugar on the finish tinged with bitter black tea. Collectibles"
2997,8,"Cereal grain notes and fresh-cut oak suggest some youthfulness here but the stone fruits and hot caramel sundae appear dense and richly layered. On the palate the big up-front sweetness evolves into nougat marzipan and caramel-covered apple sprinkled with root beer spices before more grain and pastry notes appear on the finish. Powerful and vibrant stuff."
2998,12,"Fragrant and inviting on the nose with a juxtaposition of floral and fruit notes—rose petals fresh cherries—then saddle leather spice mint oil tea leaves and almonds. Those aromas are echoed on the palate’s robust Gobstopper of flavors: dark chocolate-covered cherries cinnamon maple syrup Italian plums walnuts and undertones of mint. More dark chocolate mint and almonds on the finish which has remarkable length. Water is transformative bringing out more fruit but with or without it this is an outstanding whiskey."
2999,12,"Deep complex and ever-developing flavor that doesn’t quit. The nose shows cherry Robitussin leather sofa old books polished oak and a refined sweet nuttiness like Jordan almonds. Chewy and oak-driven on the palate with cherry cough syrup roasted pecans dried ginger white and black pepper and ample oak; flavors of burnt ends and burnt marshmallow hint at the peat—which comes from the use of peated malt whiskey backset—but could just as easily be mistaken for barrel char. The peppery ashy chocolaty finish keeps going and going. (2250 bottles)"
3000,9,"A bottling from only five barrels of 95% rye whiskey produced at the former Seagram’s distillery in Indiana. It’s the American whiskey equivalent of drinking Ardbeg Supernova. Powerful and invigorating are words that come to mind. Crisp mint warming cinnamon dried citrus cocoa roasted nuts and subtle botanicals are soothed by caramel molasses and honeyed orchard fruit. Brisk bracing spicy finish. The notes are clean and the whiskey’s not just a one-trick “rye” pony. The sweetness balances the rye spice quite nicely. If you just can’t get enough rye in your whiskey then this one’s for you. (Available only at the High West Distillery in Park City Utah.)"
3001,8,"This veteran rye never managed to ascend from the bottom shelf. Perhaps a new generation of enthusiasts couldn’t get behind the staid name or found the price too low to believe. But having persevered for over two centuries Old Overholt’s time has come. This new version (indicated by its red cap) eliminates chill-filtering resulting in greater flavor and depth. Aromas of Christmas spice cake cinnamon apple and toasted grain lead to a mouthful of berry fruit with seductive allspice cacao and walnut notes. What’s old is new again! Number 12 in the 2020 Top 20"
3002,8,"Dripping with caramel and tingling with spice this is a blockbuster whiskey that delivers across a spectrum of flavors. Maple syrup sugar in the raw and caramel-drizzled flan highlight the aroma while the palate turns fruity and tropical with the sweet drive of peach nectar grilled fruits and pineapple upside-down cake. At the same time it’s lemony bright warmly spiced tremendously rich and oh-so-good! Pour on the water and enjoy the ride!"
3003,9,"The youthful testosterone-laden member of the Antique Collection family. Bold and spicy with cinnamon and clove but softened and balanced by thick toffee vanilla and honeyed orchard fruit. Lush and mouth-coating. An exercise in extremes: bold muscular spice along with soothing sweeter notes. While its older sibling Sazerac 18 year old expresses a classic “older rye” low-risk profile Handy pushes the envelope in many directions."
3004,9,"The youngster in the 2011 Antique Collection. One taste and its relative youth is confirmed. (But no worries; it’s mature enough to enjoy neat or with some water (and would be a killer in cocktails). This is rye whiskey in its most vibrant masculine and purest form. Bold spice (fresh evergreen warming cinnamon) honey-coated orchard fruit golden raisin caramel and brandy with a crisp clean finish. The American equivalent to a young cask-strength smoky Islay whisky."
3005,9,"Wonderfully complex on the nose and palate with great depth; plus the oak is kept in check. Notes of molasses graham cracker Earl Grey tea spring flowers nougat evergreen warming cinnamon and subtle tropical fruit leading to a polished oak charcoal-tinged finish. Very well done! The clear winner in this trio."
3006,12,"Lush cooked dark fruit and dark chocolate aromas mingling with baking spice earthen floor leather and iced tea hint at what’s to come on the palate: chocolate-covered cherries blackberry jam a sweep of gingerbread spices plus fresh mint and zesty dill all with ample depth. There’s no end to the white pepper mocha leathery oak dark chocolate and candied ginger on the finish which remains complex and rewarding long after the glass is empty. (2439 bottles)"
3251,6,"Matured in refill American oak casks. Brine sea breezes woodsmoke green apples and ginger on the nose plus buttery smoked haddock. Sweet and supple on the palate with cigar citrus fruit and spicy peat notes developing. Scorched saucepans licorice lemon juice and black pepper in the finish. £110"
3008,8,"Big vanilla and toasty oak meet the generous sweetness of overripe plums and cooked fruits like canned peaches and marmalade. The deep char aromas suggest toasted marshmallows and bananas Foster with glints of rose petal. The flavors pour forth like dense fruit preserves coupled with sweet dried corn whole-grain toast and waxy notes of paraffin and honeycomb. A richly layered complex rye with dried herbs and strawflower on the finish."
3009,12,"The nose has coffee beans dark chocolate green pepper jalapeño blueberry and bonfire—like an amaro that’s trying to pick a fight. On the palate it’s sweet savory spicy and smoky: Mexican chocolate grilled pineapple and corn smoked nuts coffee ice cream chipotle and barrel char. The mouthwatering finish continues the theme with mole sauce coffee bean dark chocolate roasted pecans and smoked almonds. There are a lot of layers here—you’re going to want to spend time exploring them."
3010,8,"A nicely layered nose reveals cocoa fruit nougat nuts and spice in abundance. The dark chocolate envelops the fruit like chocolate-covered blueberries while the warming spice evokes fresh-baked gingerbread cookies with traces of paraffin wax hinting at maturity. The rich palate is noticeably hot but water treats it well and is necessary to fully unleash the confectionary notes of Jordan almonds and root beer barrels candy as persistent vanilla and cherry coulis ride to the pepper-laced finish that’s long and expressive with drying oak."
3011,8,"The 2019 rendition of this coveted annual release matured for 8 years in new heavily charred barrels evidenced in its deep orange-amber color. An aroma of dried fruits—peaches and dates—is underscored by alpine herbs sandalwood dark chocolate and toasted nuts. The palate pours full creamy and bold with plenty of proof—but it’s carried beautifully. Mouth-filling berry and dark cherry fruit are rounded out with spice and adding water only gives greater length to the sweet treacle and delightful burnt sugar flavors before a finish of chocolate-covered nuts."
3012,9,"A blend of straight rye whiskeys finished in French oak and port barrels. Gobs of fruit (red and black raspberry plum dried citrus) and crisp mint on a bed of caramel and vanilla. Lingering cinnamon and fruit on the finish. Distinctive and impressive."
3013,9,"Spicy and pleasantly sweet. Vibrant too with cinnamon peppermint stick and caramel corn. Warming spice zing on the finish. Quite possibly at its peak age for flavor maturity and balance."
3014,9,"Distilled in 2002 this is the youngest of the collection allowing the vibrancy and boldness of the rye grain to shine through (and an interesting comparison to the Sazerac 18 year old). Lush fruit Seville orange gin botanicals fresh mint golden raisin dried pineapple coconut and honeydew melon tamed by soothing caramel and vanilla. Lingering dried fruit and spice finish. Not excessively aggressive like some young ryes I’ve tasted. I really like the dark sugar notes and lushness in this year’s release that provide balance. One of the best Handys."
3015,8,"This smells of rich toffee and caramel draped over leathery oak and warm apples with a touch of paraffin that evokes age. The body is quite generous—full and creamy—as flavors of maple candy and chocolate-covered cherry are nicely punctuated with red-pepper spice. Dense fudge-like flavors and lively citrus oils lead to a finish of black pepper and baking spices."
3016,9,"Full-throttle rye bottled uncut and unfiltered. Bold spice notes (cinnamon allspice mint) lush fruit (ripe orchard fruit golden raisin) orange liqueur and subtle coconut all on a bed of caramel and honeyed vanilla. Clean and uncluttered. This isn’t a one-trick pony. It’s the sweetness and fruit that accompany the rye spice that makes this whiskey so attractive."
3017,12,"An effusive nose with aromatic notes that become almost incense-like—cardamom cedar pine resin—as well as sweet berry notes lemon milk chocolate and graham cracker. The palate is fresh and intense; breathe out mint on the exhale. Licorice tea cacao horehound candy and plenty of oak are carried by the chewy full texture. Peppery mint oak char baking chocolate and pine on the fairly lengthy finish. Sprightly original and exciting."
3018,5,"Ah the pleasant aroma of warm rye rolls nails its opening but so much more awaits. Balsam peppercorn almond butter arrowroot pie crust pine nuts pumpkin pie brown sugar and savory toasted rye bread tingle as slight hints of pear tobacco and citrus develop. Then it’s earth from sautéed mushrooms to soil. The long strong finish presents baking spices. Lovely sipping rye!"
3019,8,"Complex and complete the sweet and chewy aromas of maple syrup and crème de marrons meet milk chocolate and Andes Mints. On the palate the intense layered sweetness of vanilla crème brûlée pecan pie butterscotch and honey is tempered by chili spice and deep earthy notes of leather and tobacco before toffee and baking spices carry into the long finish."
3020,9,"Darker chewier than the Sazerac 18. Thicker too with more toffee and molasses in the middle reminiscent of demerara rum. More wood and spice on the finish. Not as pristine as the Sazerac 18 (especially regarding the fruit notes) but with plenty of complexity and sheer entertainment to warrant a score in the 90s."
3021,5,"Is this perfect? From the look and nose yes. Rich caramel and campfire smoke early on; it’s robust but balanced. Crème brûlée with a sultry smokiness raw honey with a dusting of nutmeg and a Scotch ale malt profile that’s creamy and mouth-coating. Alas a heavy bite hides much needing water to open up. A drop adds complexity spice vanilla chocolate and licorice."
3022,8,"This elder rye shows fine craftsmanship balancing touches of toasted-spice and floral aromas with dried herbs candied orange peel and mature varnish notes. It’s big on the palate with heaps of molasses creamy vanilla sweetness and orange Creamsicle that lead to pleasing cedar and sandalwood oak with zesty grapefruit notes. The medium finish is satisfying and well balanced."
3023,2,"This presents a pleasant nose of fresh-baked muffins honey-dipped apples powdered sugar raisin bread baking spice and cooked black cherries. Big and spicy but smooth on the palate with flavors of dark fruit and bitter chocolate grape jam blackcurrants herbs cola and dark berries. The finish offers richness and length with vanilla notes spice and freshly baked apple pie. This is a big solid whiskey beautifully structured and carries its proof superbly."
3024,2,"Malted rye is a rarity in whiskey and at 60% of the mashbill here this earns high marks for originality. The nose has lively notes of chili powder pepper and paprika along with licorice pfeffernüsse candied dark berries orange peel and spearmint. The palate begins gently enough then whips into a spice storm of chile peppers and spicy cooked meats with flavors of roasted pecan dark chocolate blackberry jam more orange peel and rich oak before a finish of dried oranges vanilla syrup and well-integrated spice. Number 18 in the 2020 Top 20"
3026,8,"Sweet and spicy on the nose this offers peppermint candy cane root beer barrel candies plenty of citrus and some raspberry notes. However it’s the wet earth and funky mushroom tones that make this the most peculiar of the family. There’s great breadth of flavors on the palate as a mélange of spices—allspice clove and cinnamon—ride along on a wave of persistent sweetness laced with anise and cola."
3027,12,"New Riff’s first whiskey releases were all bottled in bond from the start—a bold move for a brand new distillery. This rye proves it was the right decision. Complex and compelling it shows maturity while retaining liveliness and verve. Grassy and herbal on the nose it also has orange cedar sassafras rose petals and syrupy blackberries. The medium-weight palate balances clove cedar oil orange berries bubble gum and cinnamon which melt into an herbaceous nutty chocolate-rich finish. The patient drinker is rewarded as aromas and flavors develop beautifully in the glass. Number 17 in the 2019 Top 20"
3028,12,"Concord grape jelly blackberry jam Coca-Cola spices leather iced tea tobacco barn and maple syrup on the nose; with water the fruitiness blooms and takes on sweet banana and marzipan. The palate is hot with heaps of baking spice cacao nibs and mouthwatering oak; add some water and the rich interplay of dark fruit and velvety spices returns along with dark chocolate-covered banana cola and chocolaty oak. Warming and lengthy finish."
3029,9,"Enjoyable dark sweet notes: molasses maple syrup fig grilled corn. The spices are there too (cool mint cocoa powder warming cinnamon nutmeg). They’re well-rounded and show up more toward the finish (along with some tobacco and polished leather). Soft reserved and slightly past its prime but it still maintains its dignity."
3030,8,"Rich and mature with its deep flavors of spiced oak figgy fruit and varnish turning to candy apple dried flowers hazelnut torched sugar and cracked black pepper. The palate is explosive at full proof as sweet stone fruit gives way to earthy oak and tobacco. The calvados barrel maturation really sings on the finish where sweet apple candies and pecan pie meet big cinnamon and ginger spices. Incredibly drinkable at this proof with well-balanced oak."
3031,12,"A well-choreographed interplay of rich dark fruit—plums Luxardo cherries Concord grapes—and deep spices on the nose along with hints of wood char and licorice; it turns tropical and nutty when water is added. The palate is richly spiced—cedar ginger cloves allspice—and silky with extra-dark chocolate grilled plums espresso beans and hints of aged cigar. It ends rich and toasty with lush oak hookah tobacco and coffee bean."
3032,12,"Mature but lively character; it has dark fruit black tea mint oil fennel seed and licorice on the nose. The palate is brawny and robust—it practically eats water—and swells with mint licorice root beer black pepper baking spice espresso and grape Robitussin. The lengthy finish is peppery and rich with oak herbs baking spice tea leaves and dark chocolate."
3033,2,"From Colorado-based Wood’s High Mountain Distillery. A nose of apple brown sugar and blackcurrant set against jalapeño spice and smoke. The palate offers flavors of cinnamon and burnt espresso beans with an alluring smoky bitterness and notes of jalapeño smoked chiles and black pepper. On the finish dried dark fruits and bitter chocolate emerge with a blast of pepper at the end. Rich brawny and assertive but also supple and well integrated."
3034,2,"Part of the Tennessee Tasters’ Selection series this rye was matured in barrels located at the top of barrel house #1-05 in Lynchburg. The nose offers custard coffee cake bitter orange orchard fruit spice and toasty oak. Candied apple and orange fill the palate along with black cherries cinnamon bread and pepper. Green apple dark chocolate and raisins mark the finish. Water or ice recommended. (Available at the distillery and in Tennessee only)"
3035,12,"A pretty and unusual nose: nutty with toasted grain uplifted by fresh-squeezed lemon plus chai spices brown sugar seasoned oak and cedar chest. The palate has intersecting layers of citrus wedges allspice black pepper dried ginger milk chocolate toasted nuts cedar and a hint of peppermint. Give it time and a few drops of water to fully open. A full flavorful and long-lasting finish offers peppery chocolate oak and toasted nuts. (Best Value)"
3036,9,"Powerful lush and boldly spicy. A mouth-coating invigorating rye whiskey with chewy toffee fig cake and candied fruit penetrated by thumping mint warming cinnamon and clove ultimately revealing more subtle notes of allspice coconut and nutmeg. Long delicious finish. An amazingly vibrant whiskey that lets you know you’re alive. The American whiskey equivalent of a young cask-strength Islay single malt scotch or an imperial IPA."
3037,12,"An enigmatic and quiet whiskey whose subtle complexity begs for your attention. The nose is minty and fresh with pine balanced by earthy clay matcha green almonds milk chocolate and spice. Dry and a bit earthy on the palate which has texture without heaviness; mint walnuts dark fruit cola root beer and black pepper create a savory-sweet effect leading into the well-paced finish."
3038,12,"Don’t shy away from tasting this at proof at least at first; it’s a gentle giant whose savory character is well-served by the high alcohol. Cooked cherries blackberry jam iced tea tobacco barn and dark chocolate on the nose. It’s chewy and char-forward on the palate showcasing dark-roast coffee cooked cherries and blackberries polished oak dark chocolate black pepper dried chile and a well-woven char note. Savory and lengthy to finish with coffee baking chocolate and persistent white pepper."
3039,9,"This whiskey has been getting intermittently softer and less vibrant since the 2005 release. Additionally the 2009 release is slightly sweeter on the palate when compared to last year’s release. Is this good or bad? That depends on how you like your rye whiskeys. Personally I’d like to see more rye zing but the pleasing soothing nature (for a rye) in this new release makes up for it. Notes of toffee cinnamon creamy vanilla date mocha bramble glazed citrus soft mint and dusty spice (nutmeg cocoa) with a dry polished leather finish. I like it slightly better than last year’s release which I rated an 87. That was my least favorite vintage over the past five years. This new vintage is still not up to those classic Sazerac 18’s bottled in the first half of this decade which I consistently rated 95 and higher."
3040,8,"The savory and spice qualities here are really captivating as spicy Slim Jim converges with Christmas cake mulled wine with spices plum pudding anise cookies and quinine. The palate suggests sherry with its heaps of dried fruits brandied cherries and star anise. Despite the decadent fruit it’s not too far afield for any whiskey lover with drying tannins and added character from finishing in cherry brandy vermouth and bitters barrels."
3041,9,"Very much in the same vein as the Rittenhouse Rye with just a bit more oak spicy heat and some leather on the finish."
3042,12,"High West made a momentous change to its recipe for Double Rye! this year for the first time adding its own house-made pot still rye to a blend that was previously fully sourced from other distilleries. Apple blossom yuzu chamomile tea walnut shells pine boughs and green-apple candy on the nose shift into an oily palate that starts off soft and then picks up speed and spice. Flavors of lemon black pepper walnut-and-apple chutney dark chocolate and a lively hit of green apple make this a satisfying pour—especially at the price. Above all it validates High West’s skill as both blenders and distillers in their own right. Number 14 in the 2018 Top 20"
3043,5,"Delivering a buttery mouthfeel with toasted rye and baking spice notes Peerless is the only craft producer on our list. It’s hard to pinpoint why this young rye succeeds where others fail but one point of difference is the use of sweet mash fermentation rather than the much more common sour mash technique where spent mash is added to the new fermentation. Furthermore the Peerless warehouse achieves temperatures upward of 110 degrees. Whatever the technical reasons Peerless is paving the way and we expect more craft distillers to join them. Number 15 in the 2017 Top 20"
3044,3,"Beautifully boxed for gift giving a quality that carries over into the whiskey itself. Fresh-cut red cedar unfolds into hard candy green apples nail polish rye bread and ripe black cherries on the nose. Vague cedar on the palate becomes fruity and floral then hot and spicy. Distant licorice root is restrained by German rye bread. Earthy but not dusty with a sweet hot effervescent spiciness. Fades in a long tingling finish. Complex and expressive: rich yet ethereal."
3045,5,"First impression: spice and herbs completely own the moment. Then caramel vanilla and the cadre of baking spices develops into identifiable clove cardamom ginger crushed poppy seeds and cinnamon. Then the spice turns to another style: pepper with hints of earthy black pepper and habañero jelly. Slight hints of vanilla powdered sugar and marshmallow appear just before a medium-to-long finish with a spicy caramel chew."
3046,12,"A reluctant nose with aromas that are difficult to discern although a few emerge: white Necco wafers cinnamon Red Hots leafy herbs and—with water—blueberry jam. The palate is chock-full of mint candy even mint toothpaste plus black pepper and tannic oak; water brings out more blueberry notes. The lengthy finish laced with tobacco has more mint and oak black pepper and dark fruit."
3047,12,"This whiskey’s lush qualities are immediately evident on the nose which is redolent of Mexican chocolate cedar spice fresh dark berries raisin-studded stollen and balsam boughs. Without water oak dominates the palate but add a few drops and much more unfolds: grape cough syrup blackcurrant jam mocha and rich spice with more blackcurrant allspice pepper and lingering herbs on the finish. There’s lots to unpack here all of it good. Editors' Choice"
3048,12,"This relaunched version of Old Overholt’s bonded rye is not chill-filtered and it makes a noticeable difference. Aromas of cinnamon-sprinkled apple slices toasted grain spearmint and peppermint candies and Cinnamon Life cereal carry into the palate which balances oak and grain superbly: fresh mint licorice black pepper allspice cinnamon cacao nibs and walnuts. The vivacious spices almost pop in the mouth but settle down into a satisfying finish of black pepper cacao mint and well-integrated oak. Well-balanced without water but a few drops serve it well. Best Value"
3049,12,"An edgy and energetic rye: fresh grassy and herbaceous with orange cedar clove sassafras and gingerbread cookie. Dense and chewy it has an unfurling parade of flavors: orange cedar oil berries oatmeal cookies cinnamon candy pepper pecans and clove gum. Add a few drops of water and the profile shifts to highlight the herbal notes along with mouthwatering oak pecans citrus oil and chocolate. Lengthy and well-spiced finish. Take the time to get to know this whiskey: it’ll reward you."
3050,8,"Lemon oil honeyed sweetness and sharp peppery notes are underscored by earthy tobacco leaf and fresh herbs. Overall the impression is spritely fresh and muscled without ever seeming immature. The palate reveals berry fruits with a burst of spice—chilis peppercorn cinnamon and cedar. Takes water and even ice exceedingly well as the lovely mix of sweet and spiced flavors bounce along the long finish."
3051,9,"Soft and subtle aromas but bolder on the palate. A base of creamy caramel is peppered with cinnamon heat vanilla brittle mint and dried fruit. Firm oak grip on the finish balances the sweetness. Very enjoyable."
3052,9,"(Previously reviewed in Vol. 15 No. 3.) Similar to the other two rye whiskeys reviewed above with less heat on the finish and slightly more minty spice notes."
3053,9,"One of the biggest American whiskeys I’ve tasted. We’re talking heavyweight class here. Notes of thick chewy toffee and maple syrup are balanced nicely by firm spicy rye notes candied fruit faint dusty corn and polished oak. The bold spice notes of the rye (and oak) emerge again on the finish. Not as crisp and clean as the Sazerac Rye 18 year old (our Whiskey of the Year for 2005) but it makes up a lot of ground in its lush decadent mouth-coating richness. This is a dark decadent whiskey. My take on the rye whiskey market is that these older expressions are becoming increasingly scarce and more expensive. (No one could have predicted such a demand or even a category two decades ago.) If you are a rye whiskey advocate buy the good ones at the best price you can get."
3054,2,"Made from a mashbill of 95% rye and 5% malted barley and aged at least 3 years. The nose is freshly sweet with notes of orange tea orange peel nectarine licorice dark chocolate leather and dried flowers. A creamy palate offers marmalade fruitcake baking spice and barrel char. The finish is light but lengthy with bursts of dark fruit tart black currant and vanilla bean. Excellent complexity for a whiskey this young."
3055,9,"Bottled in a glass pot still decanter. Soft and elegant on the nose and palate and very well balanced. An incredibly drinkable whiskey. There’s no age statement on the bottle but it was bottled at just the right time based on its great balance of flavors. Notes of vanilla coconut and crème brulee provide a base for emerging notes of cedar wood shavings cinnamon soft mint and a hint of fennel. A very graceful bourbon."
3056,12,"Finished in casks that first held ruby port then rum. The nose is dominated by mature vanilla and dark fruit aromas: blueberry syrup Concord grape juice and Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper along with tobacco barn tea leaf chocolate orange and maple syrup. It’s thick and chewy on the palate blackberry cobbler and cherry syrup mingling with mint-flavored dark chocolate orange oil and well-integrated spice. The finish is soft but not shy a gentle fade of dark fruit dark chocolate and candied ginger. (1444 bottles)"
3057,5,"On the nose a tapestry of candied fruit dark caramel and molasses. Then it’s herbs ocean air oak fruit roasted peanuts pecan pie and pie crust in the oven. Nuanced vanilla appears but prominent black licorice leather burnt pumpkin bread and tobacco dominate toward the end. A decently long finish gives a strong hint of bread pudding. This is definitely not your typical rye but it sure is tasty."
3058,11,"6 year old MGP rye at full Booker’s-style unfiltered proof. Strong barrel/warehouse reek some pepper and a hint of dill. Shock: drinkable at 61%. Rich barrel flavors: oak light maple and custardy vanilla albeit quite hot. Mint and pepper zip around the mouth; now on the tongue now on the roof racing down the throat a big active whiskey. Finish bubbles on with pepper and prickle daring you to stick in a quarter and ride it again. An experience."
3059,3,"Brighter bigger and cleaner than its 10 year old stablemate (sty mate?) The Boss Hog squeals delightedly with spring flowers fall fruit stands heavy spicy cloves and delicate esters. The alcohol tickles your nose but is soft on the palate where fresh-baked rye bread mingles with dusty rye flour and Werther’s caramels. Fruity currents rise over sweet hot chocolate before the sweet spiciness returns for a long slow fade. Great cask-strength whiskey with no need for water."
3060,9,"Distilled in 2010 this is always the youngest whiskey in the Collection and is younger than last year’s release. I feel this is a slight liability as it comes across a bit green and harsh for a Handy. Bold and spicy with mint clove and cinnamon leading the way. Fig caramel and candied fruit round out the palate but its youthfulness supersedes on the finish. One of the weaker offerings of Handy."
3061,5,"With a mashbill of 70% rye 18% corn and 12% malted barley this rye doesn’t disappoint. Butter-toasted rye bread and vanilla with hints of herbs and campfire smoke. Then fruit…a lot of fruit: pear banana pineapple followed by a bevy of sweets—caramel butterscotch and toffee mainly—with a delightful cinnamon bread finish. This skews more toward bourbon than the Indiana ryes and that’s a good thing."
3062,5,"This rye has a lot going on. The palate ranges from herbs caramel cotton candy honeysuckle and rose petals to chocolate malt black pepper honey and slightly burnt pizza crust. The whiskey sits on the palate richly giving red fruit and pepper spice with a slight hint of banana on the end. The taste is magnificent. If the medium finish was just a little longer this would venture into greatness."
3063,12,"If you’re searching for the perfect whiskey to pair with ribs look no further. Chili powder spices of paprika cumin black pepper and dried chiles leap out of the glass along with tea leaf dark berries dark chocolate and candied orange peel. The palate chewy and textured stays consistent with savory and spicy notes of Spanish chorizo roasted nuts dark chocolate red pepper flakes blackberry raspberry and orange peel. It finishes short but satisfying with more chili powder black pepper and smoked almonds."
3064,2,"Initially the nose is neutral and alcohol-laden but notes of lemon grape and dried apricots gradually emerge along with sandalwood licorice and herbaceousness. Spice dark chocolate bitter orange and lemon show on the palate as well as oak char espresso roasted walnuts and herbs. More dark chocolate and spices ride on a long finish. Smooth but powerful with light fruit notes emerging to balance refined herbs and spice. (1382 bottles)"
3065,8,"Sweet caramel grainy Cheerios root beer spices and waxy crayon make for a captivating nose. The dark fruit and spice suggest toasted raisin bread and diving deeper into the flavor reveals sweet black cherry citrus zest and intriguing notes of licorice and hot asphalt with flickers of horehound and cough drop. The fruit spice and earthy notes are nicely woven together and soar seamlessly through the finish."
3066,2,"Distilled in 2014 this is the first rye from Rhode Island’s Newport Craft Brewing and Distilling. Lemon and potpourri start things off on the nose followed by appealing notes of dried seaweed seashells licorice peat and wood char. The palate is rich and full-bodied; along with the finish it offers lemon pie espresso herbs more peat and barrel char. Bold spicy and earthy but also refined and balanced at the same time. (1110 bottles)"
3067,5,"At first it’s truly American candy: melted chocolate-covered almonds and coconut. Then it’s cinnamon toffee butterscotch gingersnap cookies red pepper and Rice Krispies. This mouth-coating offers lingering baking spices throughout. A drop of water offers even more complexity with pronounced caramel chew notes developing. With or without water a complex and long finish awaits with hints of jalapeño chocolate."
3068,8,"The aroma is a mélange of sweet goodness with violet candies figgy dried fruits and molasses cake that almost evoke a cane-like rum sweetness as tobacco leaf leather and sassafras notes add depth. It’s a real roof burner on the palate broad and mouth coating offering a big blast of spices cocoa powder tropical fruits and vanilla before the wood and minty herbs drive it to the finish line."
3069,8,"The nose smells wonderfully chewy with buttery toffee candied nuts charred oak cracked pepper and a hint of fresh dill. The palate sings with electric spice and rolls along nicely with stone fruit peppercorn sweet vanilla and leathery oak each taking their turn before the slightly hot finish of oak tannins. A blend of 51% and 95% rye mashbills from Indiana’s MGP."
3070,2,"A nose of orange peel dusty spice licorice cherry dark fruit and cola leads to a palate that’s spiced and smooth and offers notes of lemon orange peel and pepper. Water enhances the citrus notes and also brings out bitter cherry dried orange slices leather and cracked pepper. The finish has good length with a fair amount of oak influence orange marmalade cigar ash dark chocolate and bitter herbs."
3071,10,"Rye has been farmed for centuries in England and this sustainably-minded brewer and distiller uses grain grown by company chairman Jonathan Adnams on his farm close to the facility in Southwold. Rye takes the lead in this 75% rye and 25% malted barley whisky matured in new medium-toast French oak casks for a minimum of 5 years. Creamy and spicy on the nose it’s slightly nutty with hints of mixed peel graham crackers hazelnut and nutmeg. A thick malty mouthfeel of toffee and cinnamon finds harmony between the sweetness crisp rye and fresh green edge of the spices. Number 20 in the 2019 Top 20"
3072,9,"A blend of two straight whiskeys: a very young 2 year old high rye content whiskey and a 16 year old rye whiskey with a lower rye content. Perhaps the spiciest American whiskey I have ever tasted yet at the same time quite tame and mellow. Complex notes of mint clove cinnamon licorice root pine nuts and dark chocolate with a surprising dose of gin botanicals throughout. A soft underbelly of caramel sweet corn and soothing vanilla provides an interesting counterpoint. Very easy-drinking too (hard to believe it’s 46%). Intriguing and a must-try for rye whiskey aficionados — even if only to satisfy your curiosity."
3073,2,"This sixth edition of Midwinter’s which is Rendezvous rye finished in French oak and port barrels includes High West’s own-make rye for the first time. A nose of gingerbread allspice nutmeg vanilla and cinnamon melds with fragrant cedar chest leather and oak. The palate offers sweet blackberry chocolate raisins and dried plums along with toasted oak and tobacco leading to a spicy finale. A beautiful balancing act and a wonderfully indulgent treat."
3075,8,"Top notes of spearmint and green apple part to reveal deeper nuances of golden raisin saddle leather varnish and pine resin that suggest some maturity. Bright apple meets blazing spice on the palate reminiscent of applesauce cake or warm spiced cider. The finish really soars adding layers of tropical fruit and toasted banana-nut bread and licorice."
3076,9,"Well matured but still with a spicy rye mean streak. There’s a lush sweetness that tames both the resinous oak and the bold rye spice…it’s a harmonious balance between the three actually. Warming cinnamon and cool mint meld with sweet corn rhum agricole honey-kissed citrus pecan pie and cocoa powder leading to a long dry spicy leather-tinged finish. Bottled to celebrate the 15th Anniversary of Delilah’s bar in Chicago. A worthy effort!"
3077,2,"A nose of lemon drops tea leaves light barrel char and herb-garden notes. The palate is honeyed with lemon licorice herbs and earthiness balancing against vanilla cream and spice all integrating well with the barrel. A lengthy finish is well-textured and spiced highlighted by notes of tobacco herbs and chocolate. Creamy spicy and a bit unusual this whiskey offers spiced complexity and impressive flavor balance on the palate."
3078,2,"Aged first in #3 char new American oak and then in #4 char new American oak. The result is depth and complexity starting with a nose that’s pretty and aromatic. There’s an appealing hint of mustiness and scents of bitter chocolate cherry dried herbs licorice and figs. A spiced palate delivers dark fruits burnt marshmallow espresso and oak char. It also finishes with a char note along with bitter chocolate raisins and prunes. (60000 bottles)"
3079,12,"Is there such a thing as “beach rye?” Wafting breezes carry coconut almond orgeat and tropical fruit aromas along with dried orange rind chamomile tea clove mint and earthy pecans. The easy-drinking palate has less fruit and more herbs with licorice spearmint and allspice underpinned by nuts and dry oak. Rounded out with orange blossom water chai dark berries and more spearmint allspice and oak on the finish. This should come with a hammock."
3080,9,"It’s nice to see an older expression of Old Potrero. This one named after a whiskey that survived San Francisco’s earthquake and subsequent fires of 1906 is certainly more mature and mellow than its younger predecessors. But don’t worry: there are plenty of teeth in this whiskey’s bite. It is still quite spicy and herbal too with strong suggestions of juniper (and other botanicals found in gin) combined with spearmint Earl Grey tea orange peel coriander and cedar layered with sweeter notes (vanilla caramel and toasted marshmallow). If you took a straight rye whisky added distilled (and aged) Anchor “Our Special Ale” and then topped it off with a kiss of Anchor’s Junipero gin for intrigue -- that’s what this whiskey tastes like to me."
3081,12,"The nose is layered with mature baking spices cacao nibs tobacco barn Cherry Coke syrup praline pistachio and dusty oak. Spiced and herbal on the palate with bracing oak coffee with almond cream roasted nuts dark chocolate cinnamon licorice and peppermint all pillowed by a creamy texture. It finishes with minty dark chocolate espresso leather and integrated oak. No need for an after-dinner coffee; this’ll do. (2000 bottles)"
3082,9,"(Previously reviewed in Vol. 15 No. 3.) Certainly the most idiosyncratic of the bunch. A great whiskey if you like the flavors but some might find the spices to be too “over the top” and almost gin-like. Try it before you buy it."
3083,11,"Heaven Hill’s 80-proof standard Pikesville is a summer favorite so I was eager to try this. A woody depth to it at 6 years old: 110 proof-hot stewed plum and horehound candy and sizzling rye spice behind it. It's a jawbreaker: full and hot in the mouth with sweet grassy spice bitter rye grain as it progresses and crackling sugar near the end just before it all smooths into a savory layered finish. Exciting ride great ending."
3084,11,"Sweet spicy nose with sharp mint jellies and brittle sugar laid over the oak presence. Shifts in the mouth to no-nonsense rye: bitter savory dried grass with the sweetness as a spark glinting through it all while a mineral character plays as backbone. The finish is prickly and warming with fleeting richness. A very lean rye overall a bit challenging a bit old school."
3085,13,"A captivating nose with perfumy aromas licorice dry pine needles and eucalyptus. There’s also a rich array of spices and herbs—cardamom black pepper anise dried mint—and water brings out a rounded brightness of strawberry blueberry and lemon. Spiced and herbal notes dominate the creamy palate along with dry toasted oak and nuts tobacco and root beer. The finish is soft with toasted oak and persistent dry herbs."
3086,13,"A blend of straight rye whiskies aged 4 to 18 years from Kentucky Pennsylvania Indiana and Alberta. There’s dill pickle peach iced tea mint leaves and boysenberry syrup on the nose. With water sliced apple and pear and a chalky sugary sweetness. The palate is piney with rich dark chocolate and coffee. A tangy finish brings with it citrus and mint oil. There is clear maturity and nuance here. (9000 bottles)"
3087,13,"A combination of 4 year old and 7 year old rye distilled in Indiana the nose has earthy aromas of pine needles fresh muddled mint and dill in addition to pecan orange peel and blueberry pie. The palate is spiced with more pine some blackberry jam lemon tart and clove. Water brings notes of cedar and grapefruit zest and overall gives this whiskey better cohesion. The finish shows coffee bean and mint oil."
3088,9,"Imported from Canada (which suggests that maybe this whiskey was originally intended to be the flavoring component of a Canadian whisky?) and bottled in Vermont. This is a 100% unmalted rye whiskey (much higher than other traditional straight rye whiskeys). Indeed this whiskey bleeds spices (especially brisk mint vibrant clove and teasing nutmeg) but there’s a rich sweet foundation to balance it all (honeyed vanilla caramel butterscotch and nutty toffee) along with candied citrus and charcoal. Bold spicy nutty toffee butterscotch finish. Very distinctive and probably a polarizing whiskey."
3089,12,"A finish in port casks imparts plenty of dark fruit and rich flavor throughout this blend of ryes which includes some of High West’s own make. The nose is leathery with plums cherries dark chocolate brown sugar orange pekoe tea and blueberry jam. More fruit on the palate including black cherry orange marmalade and raisin as well as cacao nibs baking spice cola and rich oak. The finish is lengthy and layered with cough syrup dark berries chocolate and cola."
3090,9,"A six-plus year old barrel-strength rye whiskey. Young rye whiskeys show the true personality of the rye grain and this is an excellent example. Bold spice notes of fresh mint fiery cinnamon and resinous clove. Sweeter notes of candied fruit brandy caramel honey-tinged vanilla and a suggestion of marzipan add balance. If you like your whiskeys young bold and unforgiving this one’s for you."
3091,2,"Made at B.R. Distilling Co. in Memphis this rye has a fragrant nose of dried herbs and a subtle scent of lemon grove tempered by an earthy minerality. Light and dry on the palate with flavors of cracked pepper aged herbs and tilled earth set against rich sweet undernotes of cinnamon baked apple blackberry tart honeysuckle and vanilla. The finish is smooth malty and fruity with balanced sweetness and earthiness. (4000 bottles)"
3092,2,"Bottled in Fall 2018. A blast of orange blossom on the nose along with raspberry tart cherry and dried currants set against leather and drying tobacco. A nutty palate with notes of toffee orange peel herbs and light tobacco with chocolate brownies and blackberry emerging with water. Tropical rye notes of orange melon guava and grape on the finish along with chocolate ginger herbs and white pepper. Lots of heat but also depth flavor and balance."
3093,0,"A beguiling nose replete with cinnamon crumble blueberry bubble gum and cardamom. This whiskey bakes you a blackberry pie with a flaky crust and vanilla whipped cream rounded out with cinnamon dill and oregano. The finish has clove-spiced orange peel lingering sweet marshmallow and a surprising minerality. This is at least a year older than some of the other Empire ryes and it shows. Craft skeptics seek this out. Empire rye"
3094,9,"Made from a mash containing 53% rye and aged in used barrels. The relatively low rye content along with being aged in used wood means this is one soft smooth rye whiskey. Gentle mint green tea cinnamon nutmeg roasted nuts glazed fruit and candied corn all lie on a bed of vanilla and caramel. I tasted a “work in progress” sample last year which showed more oak. This expression is much better. Not as complex or dynamic as the flagship “Rendezvous Rye” from High West but I could drink this stuff all day long."
3095,5,"When bakers knead dough there’s a distinct aroma that drifts upward as the flour and water combine. That doughy goodness is found here with root vegetable cellar and funky leather notes. Then powerful flavors drive this whiskey home: black licorice caramel-flavored rice cakes rye bread paprika cumin and sugar cookies over a richly coating mouthfeel. Its greatest flaw is a shorter than desired medium finish with a hint of toasted pecan."
3096,8,"Gentle notes of lilac sweet perfume and rye bread are underscored by orange blossom spearmint and blueberry. Heaps of spice—clove and cinnamon hearts candies—will delight rye fans as the mix of berry fruits and lively spices really comes to life with water revealing bitter citrus pith black pepper vanilla and a finish of generous char and tobacco smoke."
3097,9,"Incredibly smooth for a rye whiskey (almost too smooth) but still with plenty of character to make the journey very entertaining. Notes of evergreen almonds and bright fruit lie on a bed of caramel honeyed vanilla and banana bread. Lingering spicy finish."
3098,8,"Initial vanilla and fruit aromas are quickly overtaken by savory notes of fresh dill licorice earth and alpine herbs. The palate serves up some figgy fruit dried cherry and sassafras leaf but the style is clearly oak-driven perhaps hinting at roasted chestnuts and some dusty stale spices. Even with water it remains a bit hot and while somewhat angular oak lacks integration and holds it back from greatness there’s still a lot to enjoy for wood fans."
3099,12,"Dark berries cola iced tea dark chocolate toasted oak white pepper and lime on the nose permeated by an earthy character. Strong oak on the palate is kept in check by spice—ginger cinnamon pepper—and dark fruit with notes of black tea and roasted peanuts as well. The finish is nutty and quite spiced with lingering blackberries and a touch of bitter oak."
3100,5,"This is 3 years old Indiana distilled and has a “ladle” of Maryland spring water added. It includes two rye mashbills—one high one low—breaking the mold from similar Indiana-distilled ryes. For its youth and strength it immediately and amazingly feels mature showing rich caramel spearmint and earth. The momentum slows with subtle blueberry rye muffin black pepper and cardamom. It finishes medium with a hint of cornbread."
3101,8,"Initial aromas of toasted nuts nougat and pistachio. Water releases cedar and sandalwood along with citrusy grapefruit notes. The palate is both earthy and sweet with dried flowers leather and hazelnut. The medium finish offers a nice balance of classic rye flavors including baking spice lavender and zesty citrus. Best Value"
3102,9,"Youthful and very lively. Bold crisp spices (mint cinnamon vanilla) are softened by soothing sweeter notes (candied fruit coconut caramel and rum notes) becoming dry flinty and spicy on the finish. It is very clean and polished and it is superior to other rye whiskeys in this age range. Nicely done!"
3103,13,"Aged at least 4 years. The nose is fruity with orange slices cherries and tangerines but also floral and spicy with notes of honeysuckle and candied ginger. The palate is dry and nutty with ample baking spice and more fruitiness: tangy citrus and flamed orange disc. Sweet cherries mingle with baking spice and dry oak on the finish. This demonstrates good balance and a lovely nose."
3104,8,"Time in the barrel is apparent here with ample cedar sawdust and toasty oak sprinkled across caramel sweetness with a medley of herbal flavors including licorice and basil. Generous on the palate it serves up lots of clove and baking spices before the oak tannin sweeps in leaving a very dry finish of bitter orange pith."
3105,12,"This blend of straight ryes finished in vermouth and syrah barrels now includes some of High West’s own whiskey distilled in Utah. The nose is fresh and herbal with spearmint tarragon dill pickle fresh celery juice and a candied note of orange Kool-Aid. Fruit nut and spice flavors temper some of the wild herbaceousness of the palate: blueberry jam peanuts cinnamon and dark chocolate. Lengthy finish with more dark fruit nuts spice and oak."
3106,2,"A lively nose with scents of orange peel wild strawberries pepper spice and herbal tea. The palate presents a balanced offering of cream orange Creamsicle and bitter chocolate all overlaid with a ring of white pepper. The finish is long and silky with more vanilla some orange oil sweet oak and a hint of jalapeño pepper. Youthful and fresh for its age with a lively complexity and bold character."
3107,8,"Rose petal orange pekoe tea and grandma’s perfume earmark this as a somewhat youthful rye with white pepper and cinnamon Trident gum accompanying the floral aromas. The palate weaves together heaps of cinnamon clove sandalwood spice dried flower sachet and chamomile with generous oak balancing the confectionary notes of circus peanuts candies and Pixy Stix. Quite distinctive—and likely divisive."
3108,12,"At first the nose is dominated by wood—pencil shavings and Popsicle sticks—but it soon reveals violets blueberries grape Kool-Aid and peppery spice. The palate is dry with nuts herbs and spices mocha and semi-sweet chocolate; a few drops of water help with integration and bring out more fruit including lemon meringue pie. It finishes nutty and dry with coffee beans and a touch of lemon."
3109,2,"A pleasant honeyed nose of brown sugar lemon peel candied clementine cherry hard candy and light notes of herbs. The palate is liltingly sweet with an overlay of spice as well as flavors of orange peel and marmalade. Water brings out notes of vanilla wafer orange spice licorice and black pepper. The finish is spicy but sweet with hints of candied orange and vanilla cream all punctuated by a spice-note finale. (24000 bottles)"
3110,5,"Barely legal at 51% rye Rittenhouse packs lots of corn offering a different profile than those higher-rye whiskeys from Indiana. Straight from the glass burst caramel campfire smoke and vanilla with hints of dill weed and Herbs de Provence. Ripe in flavor it shows slight mint from the rye and a complex voyage of herbs with a touch of chocolate here and walnut shell there. There’s a reason bartenders love mixing with this; it’s good neat or on the rocks."
3111,8,"This pours punchy vivid and somewhat youthful with sparks of white pepper cereal grain aromas and an impression of menthol and alpine herbs. At full proof it opens with a fiery flurry of sizzling spices as cinnamon hearts candies meet sweet candied apple and dense fruitiness—raisin and fig—that evolve to grilled pineapple and melon. (914 bottles)"
3112,2,"A floral nose with fragrant orange and tropical notes of melon and guava grape and cherry chamomile tea licorice and rye spice. Smooth texture on the palate with more orange and vanilla lemon toasted almond dark chocolate and allspice. Water brings out pears and apples chocolate and pepper spice. The finish is long with orange peel pink peaches marmalade and strawberry then balanced spiciness melding with fresh fruit and oak."
3113,8,"An unconventional flavor profile with a nose featuring fresh mint and chocolate in abundance along with secondary notes of candle wax tinged with a bit of alcohol heat. It’s the chocolate that sticks around through the palate as gentle sweetness is quickly swept up in warming spices and bitter Mexican chocolate supported by flavors of nutty honeyed malt. Enjoyable and highly original."
3114,12,"The grain shows itself richly on the nose with baking spice peppermint stick and nutty aromas; with time candied fruit notes emerge. They reappear on the palate especially after adding a few drops of water as cherry skins and grape jelly. There’s also peppermint cocoa powder roasted walnuts chicory and black pepper. The finish veers toward bitterness with dark chocolate and coffee bean but retains a peppermint verve."
3115,11,"Distilled from a relatively low-rye mash of 53% rye 33% corn 14% malt; true to Woodford Reserve form a mingling of whiskeys distilled at Woodford and at Brown-Forman in Louisville. Nose of leather cinnamon rye snappiness and hints of red raspberry. Hot and lean on the palate spicy/sweet until rye’s bitter layering floats in making for a dry finish as the oak comes on stronger. Balances drinkable and elegant quite nicely and it’s real Woodford."
3116,12,"Spiced plums spearmint clove dried ginger fennel lilac and bubble gum on the nose. The palate is perfumy and well-spiced with candied rose petal blueberry bubble gum chili powder black pepper and chocolate tingling with a racy spicy oaky finish. Now aged 4 years this whiskey has shown improvement with every orbit of the earth and exhibits hallmark rye flavors: a perfect silhouette."
3117,12,"It’s recommended to taste everything neat once; after you do that here add water liberally. Once you do you’ll find lovely aromas of butterscotch orange brown sugar and toffee. The palate is richly spiced with cinnamon clove orange iced tea and cedar oil as well as generous oak ending on a finish of cigar wrapper cloves and lengthy oak."
3118,9,"The third recently released 100% rye whiskey sourced from Canada with the others being WhistlePig (50% $70) and Jefferson’s (47% $40). (The one you purchase might depend on which one you can find as they are all quite limited.) This one sells at a premium to the other two but shows polish and is nicely rounded. Layers of sweetness (honeyed fruit caramel nutty toffee maple syrup) toasted oak cinnamon evergreen nutmeg and a dusting of cocoa. Very distinctive!"
3119,2,"The sequel to Redemption Rye’s rum cask-finished expression following 2020’s release of Batch 1. Candied raspberries and cherries on a lightly sweet nose which also offers notes of herbal tea and subtle earthiness. Bitter cherry and toasted almond on the palate as well as dark chocolate licorice orange roasted nuts tobacco and white pepper. More tobacco notes licorice and drying oak tannins on a finish that’s spicy and powerful."
3120,0,"An alluring and inviting nose promises sweet tea mint dill and a full Thanksgiving dessert spread. The palate delivers with flavors of blueberry crumble cherry tart and candied ginger. The juicy spice is counterbalanced by oak that’s slightly too bitter and tannic with notes of dry walnuts and chili powder. But a warm spicy and rounded finish helps bring the whiskey home. Empire rye"
3121,5,"This whiskey is bananas. Is it banana pudding atop vanilla wafers or warm Bananas Foster melting into vanilla ice cream? It’s hard to say but the lovely banana-vanilla combination dominates until baked pears pumpkin bread rye and baking spices appear. A medium to long finish brings a bright cherry note. Price is per 375 ml."
3122,2,"Driftless Glen Distillery’s third rye expression named for its 51% rye mash (compared to 74% in their core rye) as well as its 51% ABV. The nose has notes of orange peel apricot fragrant oak bitter chocolate burnt sugar ginger mint and citrus oil. A rich spicy palate offers more chocolate as well as chili powder tarragon and cigar ash. A long finish of tobacco leaf chocolate custard and cinnamon."
3123,8,"Cherry cola sassafras and root beer barrels meet sweet vanilla and roasted coffee aromas. The lavish oak almost feels double barreled or small barreled with its bounty of spiced flavors—cinnamon nutmeg mincemeat and spiced poached pears. The finish deals more oak laden with dark chocolate. Nicely executed with some youth perhaps cloaked in there."
3124,2,"Old Forester’s first-ever rye and first new mashbill in 150 years balanced at 65% rye 20% malted barley and 15% corn. Cinnamon raspberries blackberry vanilla and spiced oak greet the nose. The palate starts out sweet and fruity then reveals an almond nuttiness cinnamon orange and chili pepper. Water coaxes out ginger pecan and more heat. A smooth finish that’s still spicy ending with a flourish of candied orange and rich chocolate."
3125,8,"Rose petal and grapefruit meet clove-like spice but it’s the soapy floral sachet and dill notes that distinguish this rye. While it seems somewhat young the generous cinnamon candies spiced cherry and red berry fruit pour lively and vibrant with drying tannins peppery spice and green apple on the finish."
3126,12,"Rye at its prettiest and most delicate: bouquets of flowers with boxed pistachio pudding Apple Jacks honey cough drops licorice and anise on the nose. Though it shows plenty of barrel influence the palate is more spirit-driven and provocative with peonies lilacs rose petals pistachios and nougat lengthened by cocoa powder on the finish."
3127,2,"This leads with herbal notes of dill mint and fennel on the nose followed by candied orange dried apricots lime vanilla and allspice. A creamy palate offers milk chocolate raspberry jam orange and lemon peel with a peppery back note. The finish is long and rich with a balanced oak influence almond and more chocolate. The aging lends complexity while all is vigorous and lively."
3128,8,"Sweet bread pudding and cracked pepper are tinged with wintergreen and earthy oak the alcohol strikes just a touch sharp. With water banana lemon and vanilla cupcake sweetness appear. On the palate lively citrus white pepper violet candies and peanuts before finishing with a tapestry of spices: ginger allspice and paprika. Characterful well-proofed and tasty stuff."
3129,12,"Earthiness and warmth on the nose: iced tea licorice root beer candy white pepper sassafras ginger and vanilla along with citrus peel. Chewy tannins provide a foil for lively spice on the palate—pepper ginger anise cinnamon—while orange oil cola cherry cordial and black tea provide supporting notes. The finish shows generous earthiness and oak. Takes water well."
3130,12,"The sherry cask finish asserts itself right up front with orange oil sweet figs cloves and cedar; aromas of grape candy peonies spearmint and allspice appear as well. While this is unabashedly a rye with flavors of cinnamon black pepper and oak the sherry comes to the fore again in the guise of grape soda sweet cherries and chocolate. The finish is sweet and oak-driven with good length."
3131,12,"Showcasing the sweeter side of rye this has tropical aromas of papaya guava kiwi and melon along with candied oranges Craisins and aromatic spices: cassia cardamom sandalwood. The palate is sweet and spiced with pineapple blueberry jam bananas Fruit Stripes gum and orange Creamsicle finishing with chili pepper dry oak and a hint of flowers. A combination of 3 to 5 year old ryes made at Graton Distilling Co. and MGP Distillery. (54000 bottles)"
3132,12,"Sweet cherries bubble gum and fresh blueberry on the nose along with nougat honey-roasted peanuts and milk chocolate. The palate has flavors of clove-studded orange spice and the chewed end of a pencil. It’s light-bodied and verges on thin when water is added so be judicious. The finish is gentle with peppery oak cinnamon and espresso bean. This is a new higher proof and the whiskey is now non-chill filtered so don’t be surprised by a little haze if you add water or ice."
3133,12,"Lovely perfumy fragrant nose: orange and peach blossoms tea rose lilacs apricot jam and blueberry muffins. It remains floral and sweet on the palate but with a solid oak backbone surrounded by red berries orange sherbet ginger baking spice and a fizzy zing that finishes sweet and light sprinkled with pepper and drizzled with Hershey’s chocolate syrup. (1000 bottles)"
3134,5,"Think of sitting on the front porch swing legs up a good song playing and this smooth barrel strength rye. It’s an easy sipper from the allspice and old-style licorice to the cadre of caramel and vanilla expressions that intertwine custard and German chocolate cake. You don’t expect sweetness but it’s here and lasting. If it has a weakness it loses its intensity about mid-palate but rebounds with a healthy medium-length finish."
3135,5,"High West Double Rye is transferred into vermouth and Syrah barrels making for an interesting limited release. Herbs blackberries black currant and black pepper are vibrant followed by a medicinal hint of mint. The vermouth comes alive with earthy notes meeting the rye’s traditional spices a welcome back and forth with hints of black fruits. The warm medium-length finish offers another hint of mint. If you like vermouth you’ll love this."
3136,11,"“Vatted” from five 4 to 15 year old straight ryes from Canada Kentucky Pennsylvania and Indiana in an old-timey bottle. Classic spice-candy-bitter nose leaps out of the glass with 100 proof heat; friendly. Easily drinkable at this proof well-integrated rye oil and grain sweetness some cinnamon and dried apple and the barrel rolls in on the finish. A neatly-wrapped package and not crazy on the price. Sourced whiskey."
3137,9,"One of the best kept secrets in rye whiskey. Not quite as refined as the Sazerac Rye 6 year old but it makes up for it in its sheer brute force. It is darker deeper and more rustic (but in a good way). Chewy toffee and dark molasses balance the spicy rye notes and soothe the alcohol heat."
3138,13,"Made in collaboration with Virginia-based band GWAR this 100% rye whiskey was finished with sugar maple and cherrywood. The nose shows signs of herbal cough syrup clove green almonds and orange marmalade. The palate is piney with lemon oil mint and bitter chocolate all present. Water brings out black pepper and coffee bean. The finish is short but satisfying with more herbs and cocoa powder. It’s consistent and tasty if at times a tad simple in its construction. (2000 bottles)"
3139,2,"Classic rye notes of orange and pepper spice along with vanilla custard. A full mouthfeel presages a palate of lemon meringue pie whipped cream caramel baking spice and herbaceous notes of pine and dill but also tropical flavors melon and peach. A lengthy finish that’s full and rich offering chocolate and reprising the tropical notes of pineapple and orange on the back note. Quite powerful solid and reliable."
3140,3,"Regauged into once-used bourbon barrels this is not the WhistlePig of old. Four years’ finishing in Vermont has toned down the sweetness and high notes emphasizing a complex leather/dark chocolate/tobacco spectrum instead. Lavender violets and ripe red fruit rise over dusty-dry barn boards blue clay and dark rye bread. The spicy rye tones glow with white pepper while hints of astringent barrel oak keep a slight slipperiness from clinging."
3141,12,"New York Distilling Co.’s first bonded whiskey which also conforms to the voluntary Empire Rye standards. It’s herbaceous and grain-driven on the nose with licorice dried mint brown sugar peanut oil and buttered pecans. The dry palate is remarkably light with flavors of black pepper walnuts licorice mint orange and tart cherries. Oak roasted nuts and dark chocolate on the finish."
3142,12,"A burst of orange on the nose: orange blossom orange peel orange pekoe tea candied orange slices. It also has sweet licorice sage honey and blueberry. Light-bodied in the mouth with a bit of astringency; the flavors run to berry orange spearmint and cinnamon with gentle spice. On the finish more fruit and cinnamon prevail along with nuttiness and an undercurrent of herbal pine."
3143,9,"The follow up to the 21 year old expression reviewed a year or two ago. I prefer the 21 year old (which I scored a 92) over this 23 year old. While a dynamic entertaining rye whiskey of massive structure (toffee maple syrup pancake batter and Play Doh leading to leather tobacco oak resin mint and cinnamon) its age starts to show towards the finish becoming dry and a bit ornery."
3144,5,"At first fruit and charred oak own the moment only to be interrupted by petrol florals and earth. Spice sets in with an abundance of sweetness following. Then a lovely explosion of fresh-baked rye rolls with hints of pomegranate orange peel banana and apple. Pepper spices remain to the end where a medium finish with hints of cinnamon await."
3145,8,"Floral notes of violets meet heaps of spices: allspice cloves and nutmeg. The oak is right in your face but not overwrought woven with vanilla and cedar. The flavor shows good maturity with leather lanolin and wax crayons before more drying oak and spices bring it to a close. Brings some age to the table but also feels just a bit tired perhaps owing partly to the low proof."
3146,8,"A bright floral citrusy rye that is almost grassy offering a lot of primary grain notes of toasty breakfast cereal fresh rye bread and even some caraway. The floral sachet and potpourri notes are distinctively young rye as are the vivid sizzling spices. Certainly a rye lover’s rye as clove-studded orange sails into drying minerality and cracked pepper on the finish."
3147,8,"Bright delicate and approachable. While not a showstopper it delivers generous sweet fruit almost candied red apple sweetness along with floral and black cherry notes. On the palate it shows modest structure with notes of lemon and pistachio along with gentle wisps of baking spice and sandalwood. A blend of two Kentucky straight rye whiskeys and two Kentucky straight bourbons."
3148,12,"A classic rye nose with aromas of pancakes butterscotch vanilla and baking spices. The palate balances sweetness and spices—a bit tannic from the extra maturation in toasted oak but well-rounded with flavors of cherries chocolate and spice leading into a gentle satisfying finish."
3149,2,"Orange rind pineapple and tropical aromas on the nose. The palate has notes of chocolate milkshake with nuttiness and a hint of espresso. Water brings out more tropical flavors bitter chocolate and a light char note. A bit hot but the finish is balanced and reasonably long—chocolaty lemony with more of the charred note and some tobacco leaf. Not quite as full-bodied as it might be but a solid rye expression nonetheless."
3150,2,"Classical fruity rye notes of orange green apple and blueberry on the nose along with fresh-baked muffin and a whiff of new oak. The palate is somewhat arch at first but it quickly melts into honey warm chocolate sauce caramel cinnamon baking spice orange candy walnut and a hint of pipe tobacco. The finish is light and well-balanced with more orange along with chocolate malt caramel iced tea and black pepper."
3151,12,"Give the nose time to open up and it reveals herbal and earthy aromas with fennel dill root beer and evergreen forest as well as sprinklings of cinnamon and cloves. The palate is chewy and vivacious although the proof keeps the heat in check; flavors of chocolate clove allspice orange oil and nutty oak are ultimately enfolded in cigar wrapper black pepper and orange Creamsicle."
3152,11,"Rye whiskey has gone hip. This is a new offering from Beam Global Spirits and Wines but it is not part of the Jim Beam portfolio. It will be its own new entity. It's crisp and vibrantly spicy but with a rich silky sweetness that marries very well with the rye intensity. It is exactly what I think it was designed to be: a mature enough rye whiskey that can be enjoyed neat or on the rocks but with plenty of youth and vitality to zing in a cocktail. I tasted it next to a couple of the other ''entry level'' straight rye whiskeys to confirm this isn't all just fancy packaging and it is indeed a superior product. No it's not one of those ultra-aged rye whiskeys on the market but it wasn't meant to be either. A nice whiskey but pricey for a rye with no age statement."
3153,9,"Deep and complex yet still quite lovely for an 18 year old whisky. Not as a lush and sweet as its younger sibling (Thomas H.Handy) showing more oak dried spice and a certain degree of sophistication. Toffee and molasses are quickly matched and then dominated by notes of brittle mint vanilla cinnamon dried fruit and black raspberry leading to a long earthy resinous polished leather finish. The last great vintage of Sazerac Rye 18 year old was 2005 which was impeccably balanced and still displayed great youthful qualities. The three vintages since then including this one are similar in flavor profile and while still very nice whiskeys show just a tad too much oak and lethargy to reach the classic status of the 2005 release."
3154,2,"The nose begins with an aroma of orange peel followed by a lively parade of black pepper rye spice cardamom and tilled earth then sweeter back notes of molasses and cinnamon stick. There’s pleasant heat and spice on the palate starting with black pepper and then chocolate powdered-sugar French toast orange treacle cooked apple and allspice. A lengthy toasty chocolaty finish with another pleasant note of orange and some peppery spice."
3155,8,"Generous proof and just 3 years of age mean this is no wallflower whiskey. Peppermint white flowers leather and Pine-Sol aromas turn gingery on the palate revealing bold rye spice root beer licorice cinnamon sticks and pine boughs. Good intensity if a touch brash."
3156,2,"A bottled in bond sequel to the 48% ABV Bonticou Crag Straight Malt Rye whiskey this second Empire rye from Coppersea Distilling is made from 100% Hudson Valley rye. A whiff of new wood yields to complex notes of blood orange iced tea cinnamon cloves and red candy. A palate of allspice mint white pepper and orange peel is followed by a spicy herbaceous finish that also offers citrus chocolate and a hint of tobacco."
3157,8,"A veteran rye whiskey brand that flaunts the floral quality of younger ryes with its summer flowers bright citrus and lemon oil notes. A well-polished palate with warm porridge and grain notes that smack of peanut butter on warm toast. Nice character and balance if a touch anemic at this proof."
3158,8,"The floral and violet candy notes on the nose suggest a younger rye followed by fresh citrus and a pronounced herbal quality that borders on vinyl with primary grain aromas peering through like warm porridge. On the palate it emerges a bit hot up front on the thin side as sweet vanilla honey and tropical fruit meet peppery spices tinged with caraway and licorice. A solid if somewhat simple sipper."
3159,12,"The nose is a bit reticent but with time reveals lovely aromatics of kiwi grapefruit mango banana hibiscus lilac and pistachio. This light sweetness is borne out on the palate which has tropical fruits chai masala brown sugar rye bread and a little nuttiness counterbalancing sharp oak and a full-bodied mouthfeel. The finish is short with honeyed sweetness."
3160,2,"The first whiskey fully distilled at Castle & Key—site of the old Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Distillery—since its revival in 2018. A fragrant floral nose offers candied orange lemon toasted almonds and banana cream pie. The palate is soft with notes of creamy vanilla baking spice and pepper. A smooth texture characterizes the finish with notes of banana and almond still emerging. Youthful in profile but a promising start."
3161,2,"A tropical note of lime on the nose as well as licorice and ginger root offers youthful but balanced oak. The mouthfeel is creamy with grapefruit and orange peel on the front palate melding into vanilla cream and underlying flavors of spice and pepper. The finish brings more citrus and creamy vanilla along with cinnamon and drying oak. It seems young but the profile is fresh and offers interesting flavors."
3162,12,"Piney and grassy on the nose with fruity aromas of grape Kool-Aid bubble gum and grapefruit as well as new wood. The palate picks up the herbal and pine notes adding licorice and spearmint as well as honey orange blueberry grape and grapefruit oil with Popsicle stick throughout. Lingering mint banana bread citrus oil and green wood on the finish. (8400 bottles)"
3163,12,"The nose has gooey butterscotch pralines toasted oak vanilla custard and blueberry muffin with pops of green apple and Asian pear. On the full-bodied palate stewed fruit and oak vie for pride of place with baking spice butterscotch and lemon and orange peel urging restraint. The finish is hot and centers on toasted oak stewed apples and nuts; cloying at times. (16500 bottles)"
3164,8,"Violet candies rose petal and lots of fresh grainy aromas meet hints of candle wax on the nose. The palate is quite pretty and pure and delivers good intensity of white pepper spice citrus and vanilla cream before a fairly short finish. Does not hold up to water but there are some nice flavors here."
3165,9,"More mature and with more depth than the US-1 expression reviewed below. Lush sweet notes of caramel and toffee up front are followed on the palate by light fruit dried spices (cinnamon evergreen and a hint of ginger) finishing long and dry with more spice leather and suggestions of tobacco."
3166,12,"Without water most of the aromas and flavors are locked up so taste neat and then add it generously. When you do you’ll unveil toasted grain nuts apple peels bran muffin and vanilla on the nose along with plenty of oak. The opened palate yields cinnamon and mint dark chocolate shot through with orange flavor toasted almonds grain and again plenty of oak. Warming and bittersweet on the finish which has both coffee bean and cinnamon-pecan coffee cake: a winning combination."
3167,13,"Distilled in Indiana and aged for 3 years on a “floating rickhouse” on the Mississippi River this rye has a nose of blueberry muffin cinnamon babka crushed nuts and banana peel. The palate demonstrates nice spice with additional notes of lemon curd dill and orange slice. The finish is moderate in length with sustained cinnamon spice and a bit of bubble-gum sweetness. The barrel impact here is prominent. (2400 bottles; Tennessee only)"
3168,12,"This blend of straight ryes is fruit-forward on the nose with red berries grape Pixy Stix sweet orange canned pineapple and shredded coconut along with almond extract baking spice and herbs. There’s more fruit on the palate—strawberry orange lemon pomegranate—and a full panoply of baking spices and black pepper. Fragrant nuttiness extends into the somewhat short finish supported by oak and bitter chocolate."
3169,12,"Herbal and medicinal aromas—eucalyptus menthol licorice Pine-Sol—intertwine with kiwi green banana and blackberries on the nose. It remains consistent on the palate with mint bay leaf eucalyptus Szechuan peppercorn licorice dark berries and dry oak; with water lemon oil and hints of tropical fruit emerge. The finish is oak-driven and peppery with the sweet medicinal quality of cherry cough syrup."
3170,12,"Full-bodied and dense with aroma and flavor this benefits from a few drops of water to unlock notes that are buried under the proof. Mint toothpaste allspice and cinnamon dominate the nose until water reveals sugared almonds milk chocolate and vanilla. The palate is heavy on charred flavors—roasted nuts and grilled meat—that turn to sweet blackened marshmallow and coffee bean when water is added. Peppery charred oak with an undercurrent of cooling mint rounds out the finish."
3171,12,"This rye was divisive among Whisky Advocate’s blind tasting panel due to its unusual smokiness the result of using smoked barley in the mash. On the nose it presents as mesquite cooked sausage tilled earth Lapsang Souchong and dry leaves along with saline and nuts. The palate is full dry and savory with peppered smoked meat cinnamon chocolate nuts and big oak flavor. A short dry finish with cigar notes but little ash. Distilled at Copper Fox Distillery and blended by Founding Spirits Distillery."
3172,2,"Named for the town of Deadwood S.D. where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down in 1876. A blend of two rye mashbills 95% rye and 70% rye aged at least 2 years in American oak. Orange blossom on the nose herbal notes pine nuts anise and fragrant oak. A honeyed palate offers kiwi tangerine and orange balanced against bitter chocolate and espresso. The finish is sweet with floral orange notes and chocolate syrup."
3173,2,"Made with 100% malted rye. A nose of candied orange cherry green banana and melon along with sultanas prunes berries and nuts. The palate starts orangey and sweet followed by licorice espresso bitter chocolate cashew molasses burnt sugar and spice. Water unveils roasted peanuts marshmallow char more chocolate and coffee beans. The finish is balanced oak charred almonds more coffee beans tropical melon and orange. Pleasurably crunchy with intriguing overlays of bitter chocolate espresso and nuttiness."
3174,9,"Made from a mash containing a whopping 80% rye. The antithesis of the 21 year old reviewed above. This is one bold rye whiskey which gets more powerful as it develops on the palate. It’s crisp clean and very spicy (cool mint hot cinnamon) with molasses caramel honey golden raisin kiwi coconut shavings and a dusting of cocoa. A lighter-weight whiskey when compared to High West’s flagship Rendezvous Rye but this whiskey throws a mean punch!"
3175,2,"Contract-distilled and aged in Danville Ky. and bottled by Danville-based Luca Mariano the whiskey company owned by entrepreneur Francesco Viola. Oak influence and licorice on the nose lead to a light palate of orange peel grapefruit bitter oak and pepper spice. Water unlocks dark chocolate toffee and peppery heat. Melon and orange peel punctuate the finish with hints of almond and coconut. Barrel-forward and youthful but with some interesting notes. (20000 bottles)"
3176,11,"Bright grainy rye in the nose bitter and green with contrasting streak of sweet cola. Quite balanced in the mouth; the rye is more savory and saves the bitter spark for the finish the sweetness less obvious the body neither featherweight nor heavy. That’s really not bad at all. Sourced whiskey."
3177,5,"This non-chill filtered rye is bold and ready for a spice-hungry palate. At first the aroma gently introduces herbs pepper spice cinnamon and vanilla; preparing for a hopeful taste of the same. Instead there’s a surprise: toasted rye bread at the beginning followed by cinnamon and caramel with a medium-length finish."
3178,9,"Very different than other straight rye whiskeys you might be familiar with: there’s no corn in the recipe just a large percentage of rye and a small amount of malted barley. It’s youthful with spice as the defining character (cinnamon mint allspice freshly ground pepper) balanced by blackberry preserve caramel butterscotch and a hint of cotton candy. Lingering dried spice and polished oak on the finish provide balance to the sweeter notes."
3179,5,"Initially an unwanted mustiness is present but it quickly turns into a damp cellar note followed by dill eucalyptus fresh oak and mint. Hints of smoke emerge over pecan shell and chewing tobacco. Then a cherry cough syrup note appears with baking spices gaining steam but the whiskey never truly finds a desired dominant note or balance. The finish gives it hope: it lingers with a hint of brown sugar."
3180,13,"The debut rye from Kentucky’s Castle & Key is a batched product that will vary in proof. Batch 1 has cooked cherries birch beer almond shell and wood shavings on the nose. Banana Popsicle almond extract and light caramel sauce atop vanilla ice cream on the palate. With water added orange gummies and roast coffee. The finish is sweet short and woody with pepper and Popsicle stick. (13200 bottles)"
3181,9,"A 100% straight rye from Canada. This is curiously similar to (and more affordable than) WhistlePig rye which is also a 100% rye 10 year old Canadian whisky but at a slightly higher 50% ABV. (Neither whiskey identifies its origin.) It oozes spice (mint cinnamon hint of nutmeg) balanced by layers of sweetness (honeyed vanilla caramel) with nutty toffee emerging on the finish."
3182,11,"A 5 year old rye whisky made in Lawrenceburg Ind. (with the signature LDI 95% rye mashbill) that went through the Lincoln County Process after aging. A somewhat anemic nose lightly grassy; sweet with edges of mint vanilla and oatmeal. The mouth is more rewarding; the rye’s bitter spice and sweet mint emerge to flame across the tongue. It’s very easy to drink with a flare of oily mint intensity at the finish. Good but you expect more from Dickel."
3183,11,"Very grassy with dry earth and pink peppercorn layered in but none of the heat you’d expect from unaged 92 proof rye. Very well-behaved on the tongue; oily bittersweet with the 95% rye mash rolling like an unhurried river one long smooth wave of rye flavor. A whiskey like this could be called too simple but this is strikingly single-minded. A likely candidate for cocktails at the price."
3184,9,"Unlike the Knob Creek bourbons (which are 9 years old) there’s no age statement with this new rye which tastes relatively younger. It’s bracing vibrant and spicy. (The rye contribution is unmistakable.) Cinnamon spice and crisp mint dominate with charcoal botanicals ginger nutmeg honeyed fruit vanilla and caramel. Warming spice finish. Its dynamic personality should shine in cocktails but from a sipping drinking neat perspective I wish it was a little older like its siblings."
3185,3,"Whiffs of whole cloves quickly turn to cedar shavings acetone menthol horse liniment corn syrup and German rye bread. Brighter and fresher than other 100% ryes but somehow a bit muddied with a grainy earthy wet-clay mealiness. Searing spices turn rye drinking into an extreme sport. Leather peppermint sweetish rye grain and firewood gradually emerge. A blistering finish pulls like tannic black tea while underlying rye grain notes drift along forever."
3186,2,"The age is readily apparent on the nose which offers notes of chamomile tea spice cabinet antique store grape jam candied orange and balanced oak. The palate is spicy with bright citrus flavors orange peel pepper and tingly spice. Water brings out guava lemon iced tea and mocha. The finish offers loads of spice with drying oak tannin and more orange peel contrasting with a hint of vanilla sweetness. (10000 bottles)"
3187,12,"Sweet citrus pervades throughout starting with fresh orange and lime zest on the nose as well as honey cotton candy coconut flakes brown sugar and a hint of bubble gum. Orange and lemon slices on the palate along with a sprinkling of lime zest when water is added; toasted wood cinnamon and pops of fresh ginger add some excitement. The finish is short and a touch thin retaining some gingery spice."
3188,5,"Think of an herb garden. It’s pronounced with herbs such as parsley dill and hints of basil and mint. Fruits develop (canned peaches and pears) followed by earth floral and oak. Then a medicinal note sets in forming as cherry cough syrup striking an unbalanced astringent mouthfeel with hints of mint and salted chocolate. A drop of water softens the medicinal approach and returns the herbal fruity and earthy richness. Finishes medium with a hint of dill."
3189,11,"The old Beam rye never got a lot of respect from aficionados. It’s been pulled reformulated and repackaged. Let’s try it. Smell: sweet grass and pepper. Taste: hot flashy sweet on top with rye oiliness underneath a tickling bitterness that blends well with oak into the finish. The higher proof plays well giving this a punch of flavor the old yellow label didn’t have and at a good price. It’s Manhattan time! Value Pick"
3190,11,"Sharp even a bit of a sour edge and some stemmy grass. Sweet and chewy grain in the mouth with a nice touch of oily rye bitterness some hot oak that quirks the tongue a bit then a finish that melts into creaminess."
3191,2,"Three and half year old rye finished in rum casks from Barbados. Rum-influenced notes of ripe mango guava and orange curaçao dominate the nose. A light nimble mouthfeel with rum sweetness on the palate plus candied mandarin lemon pineapple and a light pine note. Similar notes on the finish helped by a sprinkling of white pepper. Flavorful and rich with the overlay of rum sweetness dominating the rye notes to some degree."
3192,12,"Orange and flower aromas mingled with cinnamon candy tea leaves and fresh-cut wood show off the lively side of the grain from the start. In the mouth this whiskey is spicy and vibrant with chili pepper Hot Tamales green banana and plenty of oak finishing on dark chocolate black tea and lingering heat. A young whiskey but well on its way."
3193,2,"Orange mango strawberry candy and licorice on the nose while water brings out watermelon more mango and a soft wood note. A light palate offers fruitcake orange blackberry chocolate almond gingersnaps tobacco and cedar spice. A finish of vanilla orange and more tobacco with water bringing out hot chocolate orange burnt espresso beans and drying oak. Orangey and tropical at the outset but also deep and nutty particularly on the finish."
3194,0,"A very grain-forward nose reminiscent of caraway or a fresh pumpernickel loaf. A soft dusty rye with hints of peppermint spearmint and cinnamon candy and bitter brown sugar. Quite dry with some bitter oak dry hay and fresh-sawn lumber. Dried herbs grilled pineapple and lingering pepper on the finish. Made from rye malted by hand and distilled in direct-fired stills this whiskey is more focused on grain than oak. Empire rye"
3195,0,"A true fruit bouquet on the nose with apple lemon peach and apricots balanced by gentle wood. Very buttery and creamy on the palate with a panoply of earthy white chocolate pretty baking spice and minced apple. A little too much fresh lumber and banana flavor but well-balanced and intriguing. The applejack cask finish is a nice touch but the rye could still use more time in the barrel. Empire rye"
3196,8,"Clearly young and grain-driven this suffers from a few oddball aromas of pencil eraser and Play-Doh. The palate delivers heaps of sweetness and an overload of vanilla along with citrus oil and white pepper notes that succumb to a finish of new oak and mocha. Has merits but lacking in structure and balance."
3197,12,"A puzzling whiskey with golden raisin and treacle aromas as well as cereal and butternut squash. The palate is dry and herbal with faint hints of vinous fruit herbs and spices and plenty of oak. It finishes short with almond chocolate and amaro-like herbaceousness. The third batch of FarmStock this includes 52% WhistlePig’s own 3 year old rye along with 31% 6 year old rye from MGP and 17% 10 year old rye from Alberta Distillers."
3198,12,"Fruity and earthy on the nose with orange Fanta mixed berry compote lemon drops chamomile tea fragrant oak and caraway. The palate is sweet and gently herbal with orange oil cinnamon candy chocolate old-fashioned cough drops and spearmint. Cinnamon-spiced pecans chocolate and sweet oak on the relatively short finish. This is simple but tasty—a painting in primary colors."
3199,5,"When one imagines the Indiana ryes this maximizes every note on the nose warming up with mint dill oak macerated cherries and a ton of baking spices. There’s a bit of a medicinal palate property in cherry throat lozenge form followed by oak and chocolate. Its best attribute is an unexpected long finish with a big bite of candied ginger."
3200,11,"“Aged 24 months.” In these debased times they should be applauded for the correct labeling of this 2 year old. Somewhat hot nose of grass cinnamon Pixy Stix powder candy and oak. Simple sweet on the palate with a crisping of rye bitterness and oak. Easy-drinking and not overly young. Color me surprised: it’s well-made for inexpensive young rye."
3201,5,"Distilled and aged in Indiana it’s herbal floral and slightly fruity with a hint of cherry syrup. Resounding dried apricot and peach cobbler are followed by concentrated caramel and vanilla creating a very pleasing and easy-drinking whiskey. Although not complex nor with a strong finish it’s perfectly balanced by intense notes. Perfect for cocktails or table whiskey."
3202,5,"At 95% rye and 5% malted barley it’s initially an herbal and floral bomb with slight hints of earth and rising bread dough. Then cinnamon and lots of it over nutmeg baked apples clove ginger and molasses. An explosion of cracked black pepper dominates toward the medium finish with a slight hint of baked pear. Tasty as a summer sipper or cocktail base."
3203,9,"The back label of this whiskey describes it as “feisty” and feisty it is! Brandishing 95% rye (another Canadian flavoring whisky that was diverted?) bottled at 46% and at a relatively young age (around two years old) this whiskey lets you know you are alive. It’s very spicy with crisp evergreen warming cinnamon clove rooty licorice dark chocolate and suggestions of gin botanicals. Spicy vibrant finish. I’m having fun drinking this au naturel (the whiskey that is) but this would also zing in a cocktail the same way smoky Islay whiskies make their presence known in a blended scotch. Value Pick."
3204,2,"The nose starts out with orange blossom lemon zest licorice iced tea and confectioners’ sugar set against pine forest notes and a hint of minerality. The palate is light with orange pekoe tea vanilla baked apples and cloves and more pine. The finish is also light and somewhat brief with pleasurable notes of spice as well as figs brown sugar and an overlay of white pepper. Some interesting notes on offer."
3205,5,"What begins as a banana oat and Malt-O-Meal delight turns into honey and potato chips. This is followed by cookie dough dark cherries sweet-potato chips beets dehydrated pineapple pine nuts and oak. Its medium finish offers a mouthful of banana. If you love banana you’ll love this whiskey."
3206,11,"Hot nose plenty of rye spice — it is 100% rye — mint bay leaf sweet clove. Quite a kick but there's good flavor behind it; more spice oak and a firm sweetness. The finish is quite quick just some dry rye in the back of the mouth and gone. Better-behaved than most Hudson whiskeys I've had; hardly mellow but enjoyable. Price per 375 ml."
3207,12,"A blend of 51% 3 year old Canadian rye and 49% aged American corn whiskey. It has aromas of peanut shell tea leaf dill mint Popsicle stick and bags of grain at the general store. The light-bodied palate is redolent of pencil shavings chamomile dried Turkish mint and oaky spice finishing very quickly."
3208,5,"In the pantheon of rye whiskey Breakout sits at a coveted 8 years old. The nose offers its age with a hint of oak over the delicate savory herbal aromas that range from dill to oregano. There’s a slight vanilla note on the second whiff. The palate offers smoke coffee smoked paprika vanilla wafers and a hint of chocolate followed by a medium-length finish making me wish this was just 10 proof points higher. Sourced whiskey."
3209,12,"Peanut taffy licorice black pepper tarragon and lemon vie with Popsicle stick and a bit of solvent on the nose. The palate is laden with herbs—anise licorice tarragon and basil—as well as cubeb black pepper and cough syrup. There are some enjoyable flavors here but heavy-handed oak throws things off-balance."
3210,2,"The amber color portends a nose of stewed fruits—apples prunes and pears—as well as hazelnut and a hint of oak char. Red berries and cooked fruit on the palate with overtones of oak tannin. Water brings out flavors of creamy milk chocolate orange and peanuts. The finish offers straightforward chocolate notes and water adds length and depth. Youthful but solid with flavors that don’t quite come into full balance."
3211,12,"With spearmint licorice dried flowers cedar and new oak on the nose it’s no surprise to taste a wood-forward palate. Iced tea with orange peel spearmint grain sweet cedar and drying oak lead into a finish of menthol dark cocoa and shoe polish. Youthful with some rough edges but enjoyable. Distilled by Catoctin Creek from 100% rye. (Total Wine & More)"
3212,12,"Roasted lemon and orange peels grilled apples nutmeg ginger and Popsicle stick on the nose. Citrus-flavored hard candies cinnamon cloves iced tea apple skins and drying wood on the palate which takes water well. This is simple wood-forward and immature but the flavors are pleasant. (Total Wine & More)"
3213,9,"The follow-up to 81 proof Wild Turkey bourbon—and part of a continuing trend by distillers to release versatile whiskey: reasonably priced no age statement that will stand out in cocktails but can be enjoyed on its own in a pinch. Very spicy yet relatively soft in character with suggestions of gin botanicals dried fruits honeyed vanilla and teasing charred oak. Very quaffable for a rye whiskey."
3214,5,"Chocolate honey vanilla cotton candy smoke from barbecue coals and a big whiff of brown sugar cooking in butter. Then oak shows softening to vanilla and an explosion of cinnamon nutmeg and allspice. You’re thinking this is a nice mid-range rye but a short finish really disappoints. Its finish is saved by a nice hint of dill. Sourced whiskey."
3215,11,"Clear as Cave Spring water a mashbill of 70% rye “mellowed” by charcoal and ignorant of barrel-aging. It is white dog-brash: fresh wet grain trampled grass and a salty tinge. The spirit is pleasurably smooth and cool sweet in body with a bitter film of rye spice. A gentlemanly clear spirit that’s itching to get into a cocktail; my only real complaint is the price. (This is “a taste of what’s to come” so expect an aged rye to follow.)"
3216,9,"Distilled in 2008 this is the youngest whiskey in the group. A vast departure from last year’s release — which was delicious — particularly on the palate. This year’s is thinner and less complex with unintegrated spice botanical and vegetal notes dominating. Yes there’s some honey vanilla bright fruit and a hint of toffee but it doesn’t help. Easily the weakest whiskey in this year’s Antique Collection and a bit of a disappointment."
3217,12,"Youthful and fresh with piney and grassy aromas Lemon Pledge fennel seed and orange candy. The palate is thin and spiky; orange and lemon oils mingle with fresh herbs and tobacco leaf but the effect falls short of cohesion. It finishes hot with more tobacco oak and a hint of lemongrass."
3218,8,"A nose of cinnamon-sugar and citrus leads to flavors of orange gumdrop tangerine
and sweet tea. The body is quite light and quickly succumbs to drying spices and a
finish of bitter tea leaves. Passable but just not a lot to see here. (1428 bottles)"
3219,11,"Dark hot brown sugar sweet peppermint candy. A hot rye burner but moderate on the palate: the heat's here but the flavors come through clearly in waves of mint sugar oily clove and a brittle sweet finish. This is no lapdog but neither is it a clumsy huge puppy; there's real rye character the rough spots smoothed off by wood. A good young rye."
3220,9,"Youthful in nature and fairly straight-forward. Fresh minty spice notes accompany some candied citrus fruit and some light toffee. What’s there is pleasing enough. I just wish there was more there (in both flavor and depth)."
3221,12,"Aromas of black tea clove allspice horehound Vicks VapoRub new wood and wet leaves on a forest floor give way to a chewy palate led by green oak with flavors of cinnamon semi-dark chocolate tarragon mint licorice and allspice. It finishes with spiced dark chocolate menthol and a slight nuttiness. Water helps integrate the herbal and spice flavors with the oak."
3222,11,"Continuing progress on Jack Daniel’s rye whiskey; this one is 2 years old and labeled “straight.” Pale amber. New make sharpness sawn oak hard candy and a flip of cinnamon bark: driven simple insistent nose. Thin on the palate: sweet with an oily overlay of bitter grass and grainy flatness. A dry contracting finish. Not flawed but not particularly pleasant either. Someone tell Jack; craft distillers get $50 for young rye because they’re small. JD should be half that."
3223,5,"Beginning with charcoal smoke oak herbs and vanilla grains set in in the form of cornbread rye muffin and spelt pasta. This 3 year old lacks the mouthfeel or richness one hopes for in a rye. The finish is flat and short. This is an okay cocktail mixer but lacks the oomph for a sipper."
3224,9,"Sweet (caramel butterscotch) botanical and liqueur-ish with honeyed fruit and a peppering of spice throughout (cinnamon pine needles anise). Very clean too! But what impresses me most is its maturity for its age. It’s pretty mellow for a two year old 100% straight rye whiskey. (Available only at the distillery.)"
3225,9,"A balanced and well-rounded whiskey but it tastes a little youthful and spirity on the finish and lacks the depth I’m looking for to score it higher in the 80s. Notes of maple syrup crème caramel and raspberry tart with cinnamon vanilla mint and dried citrus peppered throughout. I like it but there are better bourbons at this price."
3226,11,"Distilled from 100% organic rye. Very fresh oily rye nose bursts with rye spice fireworks. Tastes like a textbook example of 'what rye does in distillation.' Spicy oily hints of mint with just a bit of vanilla from a month and a half in wood...which is where it fades needing that barrel complexity. Catoctin Creek is making some nice clean whiskey a great start and I do hope they're tucking some away for the long haul."
3227,11,"Barely aged white whiskey. Huge new-make nose soaked grain and green apple then rye-driven mint and spice. Bursting spice and mint in the mouth quick hot fireworks long gripping finish; somewhat drying. Hot but holds your attention. Lower distillation proof (134) leaves more room for flavor on this one and some water makes it enjoyable...if I could just get past that new-make nose I can't help thinking of as “too young.”"
3228,11,"Sharp bitterly vegetal reminiscent of crushed turnip or radish; sweet oaky caramel in the background. Building block flavors—oak rye oil more turnip sweet cereal—not well integrated. As if a very tight-cut new make had been put in a barrel and rolled and heated continuously for a short period of time (with some turnips). Finish is initially sweet then closes with a bitter note. Turnip dissipates as it airs but the memory lingers. Sourced whiskey. (Total Wine exclusive.)"
3229,5,"Oak comes out strong and dominates. Its astringency appears to mask everything else for a moment just before tobacco dark chocolate peanut butter and sesame seeds set in. Unfortunately these notes surface only briefly before the oak barrage reappears. It’s simply over-oaked."
3230,9,"The labeling is a little confusing. Small batch implies a marriage of multiple barrels not just a bottling from a single barrel; the label seems to imply both. Plus there’s no indication of the source of this whiskey or its age. Regardless this is one of the sweetest and mellowest rye whiskeys I’ve tasted. Spicy fresh mint cinnamon white pepper and subtle clove are tamed by sweet notes of toasted marshmallow cotton candy creamy vanilla candied fruit and red licorice. Soft finish. Rather gentle for a rye whiskey."
3231,12,"Aromas of lumber wood spice and butterscotch give way to pencil shavings toasted sawdust and cloying sweetness on the palate. Gentle baking spice and cherry flavors aren’t enough to redeem the assault of wood.

This whiskey has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: minimum 6 months;
Processing: Distilled in Kentucky and aged in new charred oak barrels before undergoing the TerrePURE process."
3232,9,"Very mature and quite rich on the nose with thick toffee molasses maple syrup suggestions of Pedro Ximinez sherry deep sappy oak notes and background spices. Similar on palate entry too-a mouthful of rich chewy whiskey-but the whiskey then unfortunately turns very dry with oak and leather notes that dominate. Save some $$ and get the more balanced 21 year old."
3233,9,"This whisky is only 10 months old made from 85% rye and 15% malted barley. It’s vibrantly spicy (cinnamon mint licorice root nutmeg) fresh and clean. Bright citrus and peach also entertain. Rich underlying vanilla notes try to tame the beast but they’re really no match. Warm spicy finish. There’s a lot going on here. Yes it’s youthful but far more mature than I expected. This whisky is certainly drinkable now (for those who like their rye whiskey young and bold) but I would like to see it develop some more on oak. That’s the only thing missing here. It shows great potential."
3630,9,"Deeper richer more viscous and more intriguing than the 12 year old (and not as sappy as the 18 year old). Complex and intriguing with raisin orange marmalade grape skin sugar plum cinnamon bun raspberry preserve mixed nuts and coal ash. Nice tannic grip on the finish. The best of the bunch and very impressive!"
3234,11,"Young but dark; this one's finished in sherry barrels. Peppery sweet fruity aromas make it hard to separate the whiskey from the sherry influence. Lots of sherry wood in the mouth too; oily waxy but the whiskey comes through clearly now with sheaves of rye rolling across the tongue. The sherry is too heavy-handed it has more presence than it should. Maybe more blending of un-sherried whiskey would work."
3235,9,"Deep on the nose and heavy on the palate. Enjoyably perfumed aromas and an entertaining palate with both showing a complex array of chewy toffee cinnamon candied fruit roasted nuts dusty cocoa and tobacco. But a very tactile leather and oak resin component dominates mid-palate through to the finish spoiling the party. It’s past its prime."
3236,5,"For rye whiskey drinkers Jim Beam isn’t the name you’re usually looking for but there’s a distinct rye nose: menthol dill herbs and boiling oats. The palate is dull lacking the up-front spice typically found in ryes and only shows hints of vanilla caramel and eventually cinnamon. The extremely short finish leaves me wondering if it would fare better at a higher proof."
3237,10,"This may be the best-known Belgian single grain whisky and it vies for attention with its perfumed nose of violet creams acetone and peach juice with ripe mango and papaya. Unfortunately the body is lacking yielding up a juicy collision of tropical fruits and icing sugar sweetness but after that initial arrival the torpid profile is rather unremarkable. The flavors die quickly with some residual flavor trails persisting. All in all a bit drab. €53"
3238,10,"Soft berry fruits and roasted spices draped in the wine flavors of the California Cabernet Sauvignon barrique. The flavors start softly with rhubarb apple blackberry fruit and Brazil nut before a spice steamroller rattles through jettisoning licorice and star anise over cooked fruits. The reverberations of the spices continue through a dry finish. With the grain as a canvas the wine’s colors work particularly well here."
3239,10,"Finely nuanced grain whiskey showing the light sweetness of honey on toast and golden syrup with wood spices peanut and oak shavings. Rich mouthfeel with an enduring intensity of flavors of glazed fruits vanilla and citrus peel oils with the new Spanish oak making a significant contribution through oak flavors wood spices crunchy oat cookies and pecans in caramel. Those sweet toffee flavors will keep you coming back for more."
3240,10,"Triple distilled in Coffey stills and aged for over 6 years the black grape blackberry dry-roasted spices and cocoa demonstrate how the 6-month finish was well-judged. A wonderful mouthfeel the wine notes chasing the vanilla sweetness fudge gentle spices and creamy custard tarts before a finish of chocolate and spiced dark fruit. This is so good I had to check the bottle to confirm this was grain whiskey. (5000 bottles)"
3241,10,"Smooth delicious and easygoing this has sweet cereal and biscuit notes vanilla macaroon bars salt pepper and lemon zest on the nose. Sweet caramel smooth honey zested mandarin gentle wood spices Cinnamon Toast Crunch mango guava and papaya with a finish of cereal notes and dried tropical fruits. Provenance watchers: Beam Suntory makes grain at Cooley Distillery and the Kilbeggan name was appended to Irish blends in the past."
3242,10,"If you were expecting a young grainy aroma you would be much mistaken. Multi-layered nose of fudge vanilla pecan cookies soda bread and Ice Breakers mints. Ethereal and soft array of creamy vanilla pear fruity hard candy and greengage before a groundswell of pepper star anise and clove. Evolving juicier tropical fruit notes risk being swamped in spice. The dough gingersnaps and hot finish remind us it’s grain. Hyde? Go seek. (5000 bottles)"
3243,10,"From vintage 2009 this bourbon cask matured whiskey is around the 8 year mark. Vanilla custard tarts digestive biscuits green vegetal notes and scents of a bakery counter pull you in. Caramel active spices soft fruits peach apple pear pepper and golden sultana flavors but as the caramels slide into toffee the grain character becomes more evident into the finish."
3244,10,"Very light whiskey with lemon honey dried pear slices ground ginger and cracked black peppercorn. Matured in marsala casks and bourbon barrels it’s light-bodied with lemon lime zest cream and vanilla and slowly adds toffee spice and a touch of red fruits before golden syrup and spice run through the finish. Works better on the rocks and in Highballs than as a neat sipper."
3245,9,"Cooley distillery’s oldest grain whiskey to date and marketed as a limited edition. Similar in personality to Greenore 8 year old -- rather light and gently sweet -- but deeper more oily in texture not as crisp with enhanced spice notes. You’ll also find soft creamy vanilla lemon meringue cut hay orange rock candy teasingly subtle bitter chocolate and a dry spicy finish. Whether you like the 8 or 15 year old depends on mood and time of day. I find them equally pleasant in personality."
3246,4,"Greenore is the grain whisky produced by Cooley and as an 8 year old and a 15 year old it has proved to be a world beater.  Now it’s being marketed as the oldest Irish single grain whiskey in the world and while there’s lots to recommend this age might be a step too far. Lashings of banana and vanilla ice cream are up front but then sharp salt and pepper slash across it and leave an astringent puckerish mixed finish."
3247,10,"A remarkable beauty from the Angus town of Montrose. The elegant nose shows a dram at peace with itself; golden syrup hay bales ground hazelnut liquid honey French baguette High Mountain oolong and rubbed spice blends. Refreshing palate of honey toffee citrus honeycomb wax and a profusion of sweet vanilla. Rich sweet oak and deep pepper notes to finish. Truly a sublime and venerable grain. (106 bottles) £2400"
3248,10,"Sure the oldest of this year’s Diageo Special Releases manifests the brown-and-orange world of 1970 incarnate but it does so in glorious fashion. Golden and warm dessert-like with bread-and-butter pudding spun sugar plenty of oak character lavender honey golden puff pastry perfumery scents and the first fruits plucked from the orangerie. Quite simply the grooviest thing to come out of Alloa this year. (1000 bottles)"
3249,9,"A really stunning grain whisky. So rich for a grain whisky with no excessive oak. Lipsmacking notes of vanilla cream coconut custard ripe banana sticky toffee pudding rhum agricole and delicate honeycomb. The flavors are clean deep nicely integrated and complex. Single malt drinkers take note: this whisky will change your opinion of grain whisky forever! (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
3250,10,"An intense syrupy nose of fermenting fruit with honey ripe plum grape Braeburn apple passion fruit pineapple and taffy with flashes of cinnamon and snuff. Lush weighty sweetness to taste with honey vanilla mandarin baked apricot peach molten caramel oak baked apple and bananas in custard. What a find! As Blackadder celebrates 25 years in business this will banish any doubts you have about grain whisky’s flavor. (273 bottles 60 for U.S.)—"
3252,10,"You little beauty! Maple syrup pecan sliced peach and vanilla-laden bread-and-butter pudding. Soft baked-apple tart smooth sticky toffee pudding red apples oozing with caramels and a fine layer of spice. The mouthfeel is silky rounded and effortlessly elegant. Finish of walnut clove and marron glacé. Douglas Laing has brought out some amazing grains lately but this is better than ever. (K&L Wines exclusive 233 bottles"
3253,10,"This grand old Highlander brings warm flapjacks baked with golden syrup nutmeg oak spices toffee brittle toasted muffin cinnamon sticks and beeswax polish. The oat breakfast cereals and caramel beckon in a fruit explosion of mango burnt orange raspberry banana chips and papaya. Rejoice in that dense ever-changing satin mouthfeel with Invergordon’s grain character only more apparent toward the end. Soft spice underplayed on a dry finish. An enchanting find."
3254,10,"Arbikie’s signature rye is matured in virgin oak casks giving notes of cinnamon swirls choux pastry vanilla seeds flaked chocolate and allspice developing a little savory pepperiness on the nose as it opens up. The flavors are superb with vanilla pod caramel popcorn honeyed fruit pulp apricot cocoa and cinnamon opening up a deep well of swirling spices. Hints of butterscotch follow ending enticingly with vanilla toffee and clove. (Editors' Choice)"
3255,10,"Strong-scented floral perfumes cotton candy gumballs nail polish remover fruit Jell-O and sherbet. Imagine Dylan’s Candy Bar did a pop-up at Sephora and you’ll get the idea. The fruity flavor gives intense orange oils sweet candy notes warm caramel and a fiery edge of peppery spices cinnamon nutmeg and clove. This has everything I want in a grain whisky. (Batch 14; 108 bottles)"
3256,10,"Sherry butt-matured grain whisky evoking aromas of raisins runny caramel crème caramel polished oak furniture and inky blue plums. It glides with a buttery texture; it’s disarmingly drinkable for its strength enabling the discovery of deep pockets of dark sweetness caramelized sugars chocolate-flavored toffee oak tannins and berry notes. A long finish of cacao nibs wood spices peppercorn and dark fruit. One not to miss. (425 bottles)"
3257,10,"A single cask from a refill hoggie this bursts with vanilla fudge cracked peppercorn wood shavings and apple strudel. Incredibly fruity with mouth-watering gummy bears tangy orange and dried pineapple evolving from sweet fruits through to banana chews. Diluting down from its considerable cask strength only pumps up the juiciness. To conclude a long creamy finish like a banana shake. Evidently terrific cask selection at work. (K&L Wines exclusive 246 bottles)"
3258,10,"Top notes of hay honey and caramel over a spicy core pulsating with pepper rye spiced Quaker Oats and freshly planed wood. An epic battle ensues: round after round of citrus vs. spice both growing stronger as they slug it out; jabs of sweetness meet a chastisingly nippy right hook until eventually exhausted both protagonists drop their guard. Dry crackling spice and sugared almonds run through a mighty long finish."
3259,10,"This is an assured release one not trying to be anything other than beautiful old grain whisky. Caramel aged oak rose petals and dried heather twigs with touches of sweetness. The palate has a lovely substantial feel to it the strength quite apparent with soft sweet toffees fleeting citrus and grapefruit then aniseed tugging at your tongue. The finish is a gum-numbing sweet decay of fading oaky memories. (78 bottles)"
3260,10,"This is massive. It even pours thickly as the aromas spill out of the glass: rich stewed apple dry oak a passing digestif trolley wobbling with dark sticky bottles and currants on the tummy of a gingerbread man. There is a rum-like quality to the thick texture that lands squarely on the palate bursting out with sweet apple and brown sugar. It hardly loses its grip after swallowing dissipating almost imperceptibly against the approaching oak flavors. Special indeed. (330 bottles WoodWinters Wines & Whiskies only) £150"
3261,10,"The nose is bathed in aromas of lime bergamot lychee and fresh pineapple cores. This is delicate refined and complex with touches of fragrant spices and a calming influence of oak. A web of citrus strands barley sugar and toffee is shot through by wood spices and surpassed by a delicious butterscotch flavor that continues into the finish.  Effortless relaxed and brilliant whisky and quite frankly I’m not sure you could find better 30 year old whisky at this price. £106"
3262,10,"A rich nose of sweet dark fruit: dates dried fig sultana orange drizzle cake honey lemon zest and taffy. The fruits merge beautifully with the grain to give a tightly integrated and sophisticated nose. The thick luscious palate drips with dates burnished orange pepper and clove leading to ginger. Mouth-coating finish of cardamom and bitter spices. (474 bottles)"
3263,10,"This single-estate rye whisky Scotland’s first rye in over a century lets you lose yourself in deep clove spiciness dark chocolate Brazil nut orange peel and aromas of pressed cigars. The flavor is astonishingly good with marmalade old-fashioned toffee rye bread and toasted malt biscuits before a shower of clove spices breaks through with dark toffee treacle chocolate and pepper leading into a long finish of toffee and spice."
3264,10,"You really don’t see many of these. Pear drops stewed apple strawberry jam fragrant rhubarb stems and vanilla pods. Neat there’s a tacky sweetness of hard candy with bitter skins of damson and green plum sloes and custard creams. Counteract this with water to bring out acetone cake mix and sweet bourbon notes of vanilla and creamed coconut. Then it is triumphant. Dry oak and dark vanilla complete one of the longest finishes I’ve savored this year. (111 bottles) £420"
3265,10,"Fresh pear grilled banana chile oil cardamom brown sugar oak sawdust vanilla snuff tobacco and peppery crackers on the nose. Light vanilla and caramelized brown sugar then mouth-drawing with apple and lemon peel. A spicy buildup spills into banana peel and banoffee pie; the mouthfeel gains weight over time. Smooth sweet caramel finish. (150 bottles) Collectible"
3266,10,"Waxy lemon light honey lychee physalis fresh hay and the slightly tart aroma of ripening pear. On the palate the pear is honeyed and ripe awash with a lovely citrus sweetness before a brief spasm of bitterness as the peppercorn and clove spices move in. Perfect drinking at this strength it ends with a tart dried-fruit note on a bed of spice."
3267,10,"If your glass is half empty you might overlook this because it is the most expensive single grain Scotch whisky released to date. If your glass is half full you will relish sweet toffee popcorn coconut fresh fruits linseed oil and some spicy and nutty notes. Makes sense as South African white maize was heavily used in the production in the early 1970s. It’s mouth filling dark and brooding with plenty of chocolate oak tannins char and layered spice. Sumptuous. (5060 bottles)"
3976,6,"Mosstowie was the name given to single malt produced on Lomond stills at Miltonduff Distillery. Butterscotch ripening peaches ripe plums and a hint of lime on the nose. The palate is viscous with red berries peach and vanilla. Drying steadily in the finish with aniseed black pepper and finally black tea. (164 bottles 16 for U.S.)"
3268,10,"Incredible! This dark golden dram was distilled in the same year that the Beatles first played in America. An aromatic nose of fruit spangles gentle acetone clove eucalyptus vanilla pods and tamarind. Soft gentle apple flavors with a silky texture; sweet orange vanilla ginger spice and raspberry. The oak is mouth-puckering unless you add water (and you can). A finish of Starburst chews although a soft presence slowly drying from the oak. Simply gorgeous experiential whisky. (93 bottles) £290"
3269,10,"This 1964 distillate has a nose of rich toffee weighty oak allspice antique hardback books dried apple cracker bread and banana chips. A fairy tale taste of red apple perfection as if Snow White polished it on her skirt. This ripens to encompass gumdrops and lollipops. Golden syrup lime zest caramel and vanilla bleed into a conclusion of nutmeg oak and apple peel. An auspicious moment for grain whisky. (752 bottles)"
3270,10,"Baked lemons light caramel throat lozenges and a butteriness to the nose the grain character complemented by sweetness and warmer fruits. Light red fruits butterscotch Scottish tablet with a nippy herbal bite to the palate and a deep persistent burn of cracked black pepper spiciness that glows long into the finish. Strathclyde showing lots of enjoyable distillery character here."
3271,6,"Two parcels of whisky of varying ages from the same Northern Highland distillery were blended together in this expression. Floral on the nose with ginger biscuits malt vanilla and peach blossom. The palate is voluptuous with sweet orchard fruits more malt and cinnamon spice. Nutty with cocoa and oak in the ultimately drying finish. (4394 bottles)"
3272,10,"This is an amazing link back to Glasgow in the 1970s. Fresh peach cherry blossom red Tunes baked apple hay bales acetone orange peel and old pepper grinders. A silky texture with red apple orange oils and a luxuriantly refined taste leads to apple peelings caramel and ginger. Such quality! The finish slips away quietly: melon peach fudge and a final twist of pepper. Bliss! Great to see Douglas Laing bringing out more XOP single grains of such standing. (150 bottles)"
3273,10,"This slippery little rogue exudes sweet popcorn lemon peel summer florals linseed and Quaker Oats pillows adrift in a sea of butterscotch sauce. Rather tasty; the cask strength alcohol rips through the juicy mandarin and toffee opening overcoming an active peppery middle section then relinquishing its grip to leave herbal notes corn and fudge. Reverberating lengthy toffee and spice finish. Water brings out more cereal notes and soft orange."
3274,10,"Distiller Kirsty Black selected four casks laid down in 2015 made from rye grown on the Arbikie estate. The nose displays greater depth and fruit than the first (2018) release with cinnamon nutmeg cocoa dates dried apricots orange oil and mango. Chocolate-covered peanuts walnut and cocoa on the palate with peppery spices raisin date and crème brûlée then a dry finish of dark chocolate cookies praline and further spice. (1220 bottles)"
3275,10,"Here’s a grain that mellowed as it matured wrapping itself in the wood while retaining its distinctive character. Nectarine cilantro stalks celery tops gently herbal candied lemon slices and Jaffa cakes on the nose. Warm buttery flavors initially with citrus herbal notes and energetic spices leading to a finish of soft ripe fruits and cinnamon. Really worth the experience; try playing with the dilution to control the spiciness."
3276,9,"According to the Christie family who owned North of Scotland Distillery before it was sold to DCL in 1982 (and closed it shortly thereafter) they would purchase the least expensive grain possible to make their grain whisky. In 1964 it was barley. The barley combined with the fact that the whisky is finished off in port casks makes for a surprisingly rich sweet and fruity grain whisky expressing notes of demerara sugar perfumed candles cherry almond tart caramel and vanilla. Remarkably restrained wood notes for such a mature whisky which expresses itself mostly in its soft creamy finish. Unique among whiskies."
3277,10,"A delightful whisky with a nose of honey nectarine fresh apple sandalwood strands of lime and sweet florals. Sipping unlocks flavors of apple pastries and orange peel before a powder keg of spices explodes on the tip of the tongue. The aftermath has melting fudge baked orange and finishes with hot chili nuts. This hits the trademark flavors of Glenrothes but the cask strength helps to champion the spices. (Batch 6; 430 bottles)"
3278,7,"A rare old single grain whisky from Scotland’s most northern grain distillery. The nose brings together varnished oak clove dried orange peel and molasses. On the palate an unexpectedly lush mouthfeel supports a flavorful combination of citrus molasses and varnished oak. This single grain has depth and character that’s completely uncommon to the category tasting a lot more like an aged rum. A long acidic slightly sour dry and spicy finish rounds out a unique and intriguing whisky. (U.S. only)"
3279,10,"Herbal notes of coriander pepper candied almonds circus peanuts and dried sunflower seed heads with slightly waxy lemon and creaminess overlaying it. This has a slick oily/waxy texture and a sweet nutty taste; those circus peanuts meet a stampede of pepper and sugared mice the alcohol strength coming to the fore at the end. Unexpectedly moreish this is packed with gum-nipping tongue-twisting spicy mischief."
3280,6,"The oldest of the 2016 Diageo Special Releases distilled in 1975 then rested in refill American hogsheads. The initial nose is slightly balsamic with green tea ripe eating apples and developing vanilla. Creamy on the palate with big vanilla custard notes white pepper and dates. Relatively short in the finish with soft spices and mild oak. No negative tannins despite its age. (1812 bottles)"
3281,10,"This example is more assertive than the Strathclyde 1987 (see below) but with a better defined grain character. Peeled plum skins Christmas spices and honey. Well-balanced yet intense it feels packed with potential. Warming with dried orange peel a big wave of ginger spice dried apple and mango ensure sufficient sweetness to swamp the acidic tendencies of the citrus. The spices rattle around the mouth for some considerable time colliding with the dry citrus. (198 bottles) £89"
3282,10,"This spirit was laid down five years before the distillery closed and has a classic grain whisky nose of green herbs and spice with notes of aromatic woods tarragon dune grasses and plain popcorn. The mouthfeel is smooth with evident strength and flavors of honey corn flakes vanilla granola bars dried banana golden syrup crunchy oak cookies sultana and sesame oil with a hot dry and slightly nutty finish. (232 bottles 60 for U.S.)"
3283,10,"The senior member of the Girvan range is very approachable with a gorgeous nose like a hay meadow on a summer’s morning while sucking honey-lemon lozenges. The fruitiness has mellowed ripened and softened with the extra aging. A thick luscious layered dram of toffee banana sparkling orange peel wood spices ripe fruits and banoffee pie lead to a mouth-coating conclusion of shimmering spiciness. This will fill you with joy and satisfaction. Grain can be this good. £375"
3284,10,"Rosewater polished antique oak furniture nail polish remover and clove on the nose. It’s fruit forward compared to other aged examples from this closed distillery; the spiced apple and baked plum are partnered by peppery heat and chili ginger and fleeting hints of coffee and cocoa. The flavors throb out of this one producing a long-lasting experience ending with a dry finish of soft fruits and ginger. A splash of water coaxes out nougat and makes the spices behave. (162 bottles) £380"
3285,10,"This potent grain whisky from a refill hoggie bears ripe pears green apples vanilla sugar polished horse chestnuts and a waft of acetone. Neat there is sweet fudge runny caramels and heat but natural dilution dissipates the sweetness to boiled candy with faint cocoa. At this strength it really takes water generously illuminating fruitiness and softening the heat. Dry sweet vanilla pricked with orange seals the finish. There’s a sweet spot where this is deliciously drinkable. (114 bottles) £190"
3286,10,"You can feel the power taut and straining underneath the sweet nose of powdered sugar sliced banana in custard packing straw from tea chests apple fritters and sweet oak. There’s instant gratification as this colossal whisky is fit to burst with honey tropical fruits apple melon and strawberry candy. Water adds shafts of sweetness to the nose and more jamminess to the palate. Made in Glasgow in the fall of 1988 and delivered at perfect drinking strength: they’ve bottled sunshine. (154 bottles) £90"
3287,10,"A rare beast of 100% malted barley mash distilled in a Coffey still. Dried grasses butterscotch toffee honey spread across hot toast fresh green apples custard creams and peppercorns leap from the glass. From the sweet apple lemon orange and honey it fleshes out with toffee apple sweet vanilla and cinnamon stick concluding with a little more grain character and spice on the finish. Delicious stuff!"
3288,10,"How wonderful it is to have this single grain whisky added to the Label 5 range of blends! A heavy waft of vanilla essence toffee toasted nuts and wood spice but there is a clear grain character no mistake: chopped herbs perfume notes mint leaf and a whiff of nail polish remover on the nose. Light-bodied and delicious with toffee nuts coconut macaroon maple syrup ground hazelnut and oak char with a nutty toffee finish. Best Value"
3289,10,"William Grant is making pioneering efforts to develop Girvan as a single grain whisky brand with more to come. The aromas beckon with masses of buttery vanilla notes fresh apple cinnamon stick bundles dark peel and chocolate pralines. The creamy unctuous texture packs in white chocolate citrus lime chewy caramels and pineapple with soft American oak characteristics. Long finish of vanilla ground cinnamon and mint. One of the tastiest grains on the market: expensive but still it’s patently very good. £250"
3290,9,"Very typical of old grain whiskies: light in body and floral with soothing vanilla and a mélange of tropical fruit (mandarin in syrup honey-kissed pineapple banana and coconut cream). The better examples like this one are not dominated by dry oak on the finish. Subtle spices (ginger cocoa powder) add intrigue. Old grain whiskies are hard to find but worth exploring. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
3291,10,"We get off on the wrong foot with that vegetal note common to certain Strathclyde bottlings. It quickly blows over to release candied lemon and orange slices fresh-baked honey biscuits eucalyptus clove and eventually some fresh breath mints. Divinely sweet orange and lemon puddings caramelized sugars close to burning and soor plooms. Despite the lemon sweetness at the fringes there remains a central core of mint and clove. Sherbet lemons fizz on the tongue to finish. All is forgiven. £88"
3292,10,"Need more whisky? Of course you do! Try this then. It was matured in a sherry butt following distillation in 2005: savory beefy roasted meat juices brisket bark balsamic vinegar new strips of colored plasticine and chocolatey Guatemalan coffee beans. A sherried soft and wispy opener with a whiff of ginger clove plum charred notes raisins and black bun: this youngster can handle itself alright. A cloying clingy finish with heat sweet sherry notes and spices. Give it plenty!"
3293,10,"A divine lilting nose of exotic summery fruits that brings a smile to your face. Split papaya fleshy mango and candied peel join freshly squeezed OJ and sugar-dusted marshmallows. The thick syrupy texture fizzes attractively on the palate with flavors of warm marmalade on buttered granary toast. After some mid-palate heat there is flavored sherbet candy mint and burnt orange on the finish. Fruity but happily not sugary sweet like some grains. (171 bottles for Europe and Asia) £85"
3294,10,"Selected from one of Scotland’s most fascinating distilleries and finished in fresh bourbon casks from Chicago’s Koval Distillery the nose has light lemon white pepper mixed citrus green melon green chili and floral notes. Soft pulpy melon green fruits poached pear hints of citrus then a wave of brown sugar and caramel sweetness melts into buttery fudge with a late burst of cloves peppercorn and toasted hazelnut. (635 bottles for U.S.)"
3295,10,"Toasted coconut custard cream biscuits vanilla freshly peeled banana skins and ice cream wafers make this an enticing olfactory prospect. Vanilla lemon cream and shortbread this puffs out beautifully with a tug of pepper always in balance before relaxing into lemon meringue pie territory with those sweet lemons persisting into the finish. A mellow well-balanced offering but you’ll know the truth when you taste it."
3296,10,"Like a throwback to childhood: fruity lollipops Love Hearts and gobstoppers. Stewed apple crusty bread and dry roasted coriander seeds add more dimension to the nose. The palate has toffee orange peel dates and briefly flirts with chocolate and coffee though this grain has mouth-drawing astringency and savory spices to balance the sweetness. Long finish of aniseed spiced dark toffee and charred oak."
3297,10,"There’s little quality Port Dundas being bottled so don’t pass up the opportunity for this one. It evokes aromas of grated milk chocolate grilled pancakes apricot mango and poached pear Jell-O with spice notes of ground cumin cinnamon and nutmeg. This is simply delicious: a honey pot of sticky sweetness. A rich cask strength grain whisky with notes of mandarin and candied jellies. A dash of water enables the sweet creamy flavors to swirl around the mouth. £64"
3298,10,"The oldest in the Strathcolm trio of whiskies this has greater depth and richness on the nose with caramel ground hazelnut whole-wheat bagels honey and fragrant roasted spices. With cinnamon-dusted Quaker Oats honey vanilla and spice on the tongue this has more body with deeply toasted spice and honey sweetness on the finish. (3000 bottles)"
3299,10,"Mid-period Garnheath here the distillery existing for barely 20 years. This brings aromas of freshly ground pepper oils soft fudge and dry monkey nut shells. The fudge is smothered by spices exploding in the mouth: ginger nutmeg pepper and cinnamon. Warm toffees oak and citrus emerge late but boy this dram has great stamina and length. Sure the finish has an oakiness slight sourness and a gentle spicy pepperiness but water subtracts more than it gains. A genuine rarity. (141 bottles) £222"
3300,10,"A rather moreish grain and Wemyss certainly nailed the chocolate orange aromas on the nose here. Bright bursts of rich orange and comforting milk chocolate accompany gentle underlying spices star anise treacle-drizzled hams and Godiva mint pearls. The palate is easygoing with chocolate muffins condensed milk dates and milky Coco Pops. There is oak but it’s never obtrusive and of course cold mocha that fades slowly until the moment has passed. (240 bottles) £102"
3301,10,"Apples squeezed in a cider press sherbet Dib Dabs and cinnamon sticks comprise the nose of this west coast grain whisky. It’s lip-tingling at cask strength; the lemon and molten honey tussling with the effervescence of the Dib Dabs before golden syrup pours over the tongue. It’s like crunching through a packet of powdery Love Hearts erupting in the mouth. Water encourages peach fondant French fancies flavors with a slightly pushy fruit skin note at the finish. £75"
3302,10,"Rich notes of baking chocolate compacted dry earth runny caramel and garam masala highlight the versatility of aromas between these expressions. Chocolate digestive biscuits plain chocolate nibs caramel a hit of mouth-puckering pepper and chili heat but the chocolate endures. A zinging finish akin to Tache spiced bark."
3303,9,"Antique gold. Thought-provoking aromas and flavors of molasses leather vanilla and wood spices with a hint of bourbon and rum. Light to medium in body. Given that this whisky is so mature and rather light in body it has held up very well-the woody dryness is balanced nicely by the sweetness of the grain."
3304,10,"Drawn from a pair of casks filled back in 1962 this brings out dried mango strips white chocolate melon honeysuckle and light vanilla with pepper and cumin around the fringes. Plenty to explore. Maple syrup flavors with plenty of thick tannins but its vitality is intact. Darker verging on bitter notes appear later on as it melds into rootsy funky territory with burnt butter deep vanilla treacle and spiced coffee. More wood with dry nuttiness on the finish. Leave off the water. £500"
3305,10,"Produced the year before the distillery closed this has lemon butter popcorn bouquet garni garlic shoots and chopped cilantro ensuring the imbiber knows this is grain not one masquerading as a single malt. Light green fruits reminiscent of melon apple and nectarine on the palate with caramel vanilla a little oak and a ripple of spice notably coriander seed and pepper before a finish of pears in golden syrup."
3306,10,"Can it really be six years since the distillery closed and they demolished the chimney stack? This nose has a much stronger grain character than the other two Old Particular releases so one to try before you buy. Beach driftwood and toasted spice aromas with flavors of warm butterscotch mandarin and peach on a peppery base shuffling into dried fruits and muscovado sugar before a spicy nougat finish. This is hardcore. (K&L Wines exclusive 243 bottles)"
3307,10,"The closed grain distillery niche is small but Cambus rightly has its followers. The latest in a series of sequential cask releases from Signatory this refill butt signals a grassy nose of green hay bales tangerine potting compost white pepper and almond-studded nougat. To drink it’s like joyously biting into a tangerine marshmallow to be rewarded with thick cloudy puffs of flavor with a peppery accompaniment.  Dabble with the water to reveal the delights of orange creamsicle pie. £65"
3308,10,"This opens promisingly with creamy buttery aromas of vanilla frosting toasted crumpets and dry spices and delivers on that promise in flavor. A charming silky texture with vanilla sweetness hints of lemon spice and flavors of baked goods arriving in time for the finish of toasted spice. One to splash over ice and sip in the great outdoors. (6000 bottles)"
3309,10,"This refill butt has produced a perfumed and aromatic whisky with peach green foliage maize a spritz of melon juice and a pinch of ground cinnamon and nutmeg rubbed between the fingers. It’s zingy! Ginger sears the lips before the warmth of the ginger invades the mouth. The satin texture of honey and vanilla concludes with Spangles before it enters a long mouth-coating finish of sweet ginger. With water soft ripe fruit abounds; the ginger harmonizes rather than attacks. (282 bottles) £83"
3310,10,"Vanilla ice cream drizzled in caramel and speared with a couple of wafers. Ground hazelnut faint dashes of cinnamon and garam masala complete the nose. A brief opener of rich toffee and tangy citrus is overrun with a piquant acidic rush and nippy alcohol flare. It’s actually light in texture and a largely absorbing experience ending on some dusty marshmallow notes though never losing the tanginess. Water accentuates the tangerine and mandarin but negates the mallow candy flavors. (264 bottles)"
3311,10,"The nose evokes aromas of school textbook spines freshly planed oak vanilla and dry-roasted fennel and coriander seeds. A mouth-puckering sip begins innocently enough with golden caramels and toffee before a double whammy of spice and alcohol give it quite a kick. The sweetness concentrates deliciously becomes tangy before sliding into a finish of long-lingering spices and residual oaky sweetness. (Cask no. 901820; 168 bottles)"
3312,10,"The strength is immediately apparent though the nose has a curious mix of potato chips tarragon salt and fizzy sherbet. The palate is more fruity quite syrupy and sugary with a lift of honeycomb and spicy ginger. It develops spiced orange notes lime soft summer fruits vanilla and Milka chocolate encased in a thick dense mouthfeel with nutmeg dried peel and powdered chocolate. A rumbustious dram at cask strength but when tamed it coaxes out ginger-sprinkled papaya and mango. (96 bottles) £89"
3313,10,"Red apple skin sharp citrus zest peach stone and shortcake biscuit greet the nose though there is abundant grain character with lemongrass and coriander seeds too. A muscular dram from a closed distillery this reveals sweet cereals honey a spectrum of citrus notes sherbet sweetness pepper clove and herbal notes. Sweetness remains with the pepper in the finish though clove reigns supreme when water is added."
3314,10,"Buttery croissants golden honey peach stone rye cracker bread royal icing vanilla essence and dry oak. It’s sweet and sticky with icing sugar and yellow fruits before a scorching alcohol burn kicks in lasting 30 seconds. It settles down to banana custard and vanilla becoming tangy with candied peel Turkish delight and Edinburgh rock. The gum-tingling finish evaporates quickly. Careful—water disables the flavors all too easily though adds some toasty spice and warmth. (192 bottles) £96"
3315,10,"A pale grain from the colossal Fife distillery released at 18 years old as part of Signatory’s Vintage Single Grain Collection. Vanilla icing digestive biscuits pumpernickel toasted coconut flakes crushed cumin seed and a background note of fresh mint are apparent. The vanilla and blossom honey flavors are in union with the buttery lightweight texture and there’s a pulsating spiciness that lives on in the finish. A refreshing alternative. £26"
3316,10,"Spicy from the start this has aromas of earthy whole spices rolled marzipan new books and bakery shelves. Before it lays down the spices it shows its hand with sweet vanilla cereal notes flapjacks and almond paste on the palate. The finish has toasted oats golden syrup and spiciness. Decent whisky though the sweetness is pegged back and the other Strathcolm grains show greater personality. (3000 bottles)"
3317,10,"Green grapes fresh apple caramel wood spices cinnamon nutmeg and digestive biscuits show the freshness of this quarter-century dram. Before the alcohol grips sweet corn flavors and acidic-citrus fruitiness present themselves (a North British characteristic). A pleasurable thick-textured taste of cookie dough lime lemon orange Jell-o and oak spices. A sparkling citrus finish dances on the tip of the tongue. Water discharges the taste of artificial sweeteners so buck up and take it as it comes. (K&L Wines Exclusive)"
3318,9,"A rare bottling indeed from this now defunct grain distillery. Very tropical with a macaroon and vanilla cream foundation. Complementary notes of marshmallow crème brulee honey and pineapple. Surprisingly vibrant for a 43 year old whisky and while expressing sweeter notes not at all cloying (the grain whisky aspects actually help here). Soothing and distinctive. Great price too!"
3319,10,"Nearly a quarter of a century since Cambus Distillery closed select casks are still being bottled by the independents. Grapefruit peel fruit teas lemon zest mixed spice cardamom and wild garlic make for an intriguing nose. A sweet taste of sugared almonds lemon bonbons strands of candied peel bananas and vanilla before the spices stomp all over the sweetness. Hot dry spicy finish with just a lick of butterscotch."
3320,10,"This was distilled the year before Carsebridge joined Scottish Grain Distillers under Distillers Company Limited (DCL). It brings a nose of toasted muffins whole lemon light honey vanilla pencil shavings and a slight herbal hit. Smooth thick and viscous with light lemon honey gentle spices peach melba and toffee. The finish is silky and mouth-coating; rich and luxuriant. A venerable pleasant old grain but it lacks the zing to become truly exceptional and distinctive. (101 bottles) £267"
3321,10,"Perfect for fall; like strolling through an orchard polishing a windfall apple before crunching into its juicy fruit. Nose of caramel dry worked wood banana chips cinnamon and Indian spices. The palate is warming with apple juice backed by a slowly growing spice note later caramels and a slight oxidized apple and brown peel note to end. The finish has a mildly bitter apple tinge and buzzing spices. The apple sings out with a dash of water. (494 bottles) £89"
3322,10,"As young a Caledonian as you’ll find; I found the nose rather underdeveloped. Crystallized lemon slices green banana solvents dry grasses and a sniff of nail polish remover. In the mouth lemon flavors saccharine sweet honey and banana dipped in melted chocolate while the alcohol nips at the tongue. A good trajectory redeems its character leaving deep throbbing spice notes in the finish with bitter citrus at the fringes."
3323,10,"More typical grain whisky territory here with a nose of cornflakes fresh cream cut grass filaments of orange peel and a curiously dull pepper note. Spice sweetness and citrus fight for dominance. Spice wins with a K.O. on sweetness and lays the citrus out cold on the canvas. Creamy chocolate notes tarnished with hot pepper on the finish though coffee-pot flavors emerge with a dash of water."
3324,10,"This is a little darker in color than its younger counterpart (see below) although it is achieved without the complex recipe of different cask maturation that characterized the 2011 Special Releases bottling. Weetabix hazelnut shells and the aroma of warm pretzels from a street vendor waft out of the glass. It’s a soft silky wheat-flavored whisky that reaches into dark toffee and nutty territory. Imagine a molten toffee crisp if you like. A nougat and walnut-whip finish. Distinctively different."
3325,10,"The nose has a conspicuous grain quality to it like a bouquet of flowers in a nail salon. In addition to acetone there is orange fondant and the smell of new Legos. Soft marshmallow and orange cream dilute to strawberry candy soft peaches and pineapple but it’s all swept aside by a Tabasco jackhammer that ricochets between the tongue and palate. Finish of Gatorade fruit punch and ginger root. (246 bottles)"
3326,10,"Sharp citrus notes like an unruly spritz of grapefruit juice first thing in the morning. This is an assertive dram with aromas of lemon bonbon sour fruits toffee fruit sodas and a whiff of potions and unguents wafting from the back room of a pharmacy. It floats between sweet and sour fruits settling on a sweet lemon mush wedged between some nibbling spices."
3327,10,"From the most westerly grain distillery in Scotland comes this wee charmer offering coconut fondant galia melon fresh cream and a pleasing fragrant foliage note (walking through dense reed beds in early summer). A big juicy dram with citrus tropical fruits and dabs of white pepper heat. The creaminess builds as dilution occurs then it reaches a natural plateau and hits cruise. An intensely tangy and long finish of dried fruits. (232 bottles) £81"
3328,10,"Drawn from a single refill barrel the nose is like a day in the life of a honeybee: streams of pollen rich nectar heady scents of flying over bright summer flowers and summer picnics of white peaches and lemonade before returning to the hive to the sweet sticky honey. It’s quite a buzz! There’s an acidic palate of lemon juice lime honey and lemon pith bordering on bitterness. The finish is incredibly dry like someone just invented lemon-scented sandpaper. (168 bottles) £85"
3329,10,"Creamy vanilla fresh-cut grass gentle herbal notes Murray mints and the warm newsprint wrappers of fish and chips on the coast (in a lovely comforting way). The cereals provide a sweet biscuit note butterscotch candy gingersnaps and a nip of aniseed. The outturn of cask #10804 its taste develops with dried orange peel cookie dough and vanilla. Quite scrumptious! Fading slowly it leaves behind gentle spices and syrup-drizzled popcorn. (198 bottles) £86"
3330,7,"An uncommon 26 year Lowland single grain whisky made from wheat and aged in refill bourbon casks. Oak is quite present on the nose but it's not alone: there's also bright citrus pine and white cake. The opening is softer with vanilla and apricot but it's only a brief respite before a very spicy mid-palate focused around oak and white pepper. There is a fair amount of fire from the alcohol which drives a very spicy and dry finish. (U.S. only)"
3331,10,"Sweet top notes of brioche loaf with baking spices but there are savory flavors of pastrami bark lurking deep in the glass. Flavors of golden syrup and butterscotch unfurl beautifully from within the thick texture at cask strength. Roasted spices explode but as it dilutes stewed fruits and sucked boiled candy notes are found. Water emphasizes confectionary elements and purple fruits but kills the spices stone dead. Dry spicy heat on the finish. (490 bottles) £85"
3332,10,"A tasty example from the historic North British distillery in Edinburgh with a bouquet of vanilla sweet hay and mint ice cream. A sip made me nostalgic for childhood candies such as sherbet-filled fizzy flying saucers and prohibited ivory-white candy sticks. I was seized by the initial lemon zing of acidic tartness which becomes creamier before a richer candied peel taste appears. There’s a clean sweet finish and the mint pops up with water. Overall satisfying but uncomplicated."
3333,10,"This refill barrel is perhaps more suited to those well versed in drinking grains regularly. The nose is herbal with tarragon endive leaves and artichoke hearts though there is balance from oat biscuits and honey. The palate begins clean and pure builds complexity with vegetal notes and honey sweetness before delivering flavors of dates nougat wheat crackers and dry toasted spices. The drying finish has Quaker oats and sizzling spices. An acquired taste this one but not without merit. (162 bottles) £87"
3334,10,"A light golden dram from a refill hoggie redolent of fragrant honey custard slices orange water perfumed soaps and fresh spring blossom. Vanilla dried peel and shortbread petticoat tails on the palate that develops with spun sugar flavors. The whole concoction is anchored by a little oak but the cask has been gentle. The finish is mouth-drawing but settles down like a well-sucked butterscotch. Mellow and serene. (305 bottles) £91"
3335,10,"I’m playfully perplexed as to whether the titular “vintage” refers to an elderly strawberry or an aged punnet. Undaunted this example from the Highland powerhouse noses much better than promised with fresh mint small tight strawberry buds sandy loam and a saccharine sweetness. It has a sweet syrupy fat flavor in turn revealing caramel buttery notes white chocolate vanilla and black currant. A satisfying finish of browning butter and warm chestnuts. (242 bottles) £82"
3336,10,"Oh boy! It’s like tearing open a warm banana-and-toffee muffin the steam bringing the moist sweet goodness to your nostrils. Roasted peach and neat orange cordial join the party. On the palate the alcohol strength is noticeably strong with flavors of red currant cranberry and black pepper. At the fruitier end of the Cambus spectrum this concludes with a whimper of spices leading to a nip of cinnamon and bitter vanilla in the tail. (270 bottles) £87"
3337,10,"It’s been four years since Diageo last released an official single grain whisky from this Glasgow distillery. This will kick off your evening with its aromas of golden syrup flapjacks light vanilla sponge fingers and waxy linseeds. The American oak notes are all over this: vanilla sweet granola and pecan yet there is a squeeze of lemon and a square of milk chocolate too. The creamy finish has real length and makes this a most accessible grain whisky."
3338,10,"An official Strathclyde from Chivas Bros. presented in its squat bottle from their under-appreciated Cask Strength Edition series. I found a peculiar nose comprising shafts of lemongrass garlic bulb root ginger taffy candy and green tea. As an Iron Dram it’s oily and bold with coconut fresh mint and green pea with a savory note tugging at the taste buds. Dilution highlights scallions a light creamy toffee and Reese’s peanut butter cups. Curiously intriguing: for bold flavor explorers only. £43"
3339,9,"Some of these older Duncan Taylor grain whiskies are very individualistic and exciting. With others the wood has gotten the best of them (Grain whiskies are light in body and thus vulnerable to excessive oak aging). This one fortunately gravitates more towards the former with a rather reserved oak influence given its age. A bit tight on the nose. Rather sweet too and somewhat viscous. Notes of vanilla crème brulee marzipan caramel-coated popcorn brown sugar toasted coconut and subtle pineapple and papaya. A gentle dried spice finish rescues the whisky from all the sweetness."
3340,10,"Scooped-out spaghetti squash whole red bird’s eye chilies celery tops and country ham. It is redolent of sugary-sweet candies like Spangles (from the 1970s). Light and delicate initially moving into phases of vanilla sponge dried raspberry and peppery spices then the vegetal notes grow larger in the later phases. An enjoyable effort from refill cask #10439 but it fizzles out leaving a finish of light pepperiness heat and sodden newspapers. £88"
3341,10,"Did you hear that this distillery produced its 2.5 billionth liter of alcohol in 2015? This example from a refill hoggie has a floral bouquet with a nose of snapped fingers of vanilla shortbread butter frosting and Angel Delight. An oily texture with flavors reminiscent of popcorn turns to caramel vanilla parkin and gingersnaps. There are some growling base notes of peppercorn but it ends on a singed popcorn note. Sticky nougat and toasted corn chips on the finish. (294 bottles) £76"
3342,10,"Cometh the night. Shadows veil a whisky hewn from the cold lands in the north. A whisky of black cherry crème de prune rancio balsamic and salt for it has known a mythical chimera cask; half Pedro Ximénez half oloroso wood. The magical syrupy texture foretells of passion fruit fig cherry and raisins but prophesizes that cask char will dominate the swallow. Dark forces swamp the quest for grain though there is taste hope and nourishment for the journey ahead. £77"
3343,10,"A single grain whisky made equally from wheat and barley to keep you amused until R&B Distillers builds their new distilleries. The first impression created by the oloroso cask finish is an abundance of fruit sugar sweetness; cherry raspberry plus freshly picked mint leaves. This is a bold muscular assertive grain where the juicy fruit is soured by aniseed licorice and toasted walnut. Notes of dried apple accompany a hot drying finish. Water straightens it all out though. £50"
3344,10,"Unmistakably grainy in character this offers aromas of pink lemonade Dubble Bubble faint vanilla confectioner’s sugar and mild herbal tones. Its redeeming qualities are the good thick texture and creamy buttery feeling in the mouth. Sparkling orange and processed raspberry and strawberry flavors are hit by a surge of pepper and clove which subsides to allow some late herbal notes to creep in. The finish has a heavy clove note. File this as a grain enthusiast’s grain whisky. £81"
3345,10,"Vicks inhaler (menthol camphor and pine needle oil) freshly unwrapped sticks of spearmint gum cilantro and root ginger make for a stimulating if not exactly charming olfactory experience. Mouth-filling and structured with good weight this has sweet orange and a mild gingery glow. Although there are fleeting vegetal notes it stays just sweet of the middle. Close heat on the finish saturating the taste buds with spice and dark citrus. £83"
3346,10,"You can smell the time that has elapsed on this dark chestnut dram. Glimpses of vanilla essence mushroom gills blueberries aged balsamic vinegar and beef stock. Flavors swirl around charred meat juices walnut oil chewed leather rancio tobacco leaf tree bark black toffee and licorice root. A slight creamy salvation tugs it from its oaky and savory comfort zone. The moderate finish is awash with Brazil nut and bitter coffee grounds. Forget about adding water. An ancient fragile grain whisky. (K&L Wines exclusive)"
3347,10,"A sweet aromatic nose with fresh cream flaked almonds macaroons pomegranate juice and a veneer of vanilla from this refill barrel. The palate starts warm and sweet then revs up to full power; light butterscotch cotton candy clementine Toledo marzipan and corn kernels with a hint of fresh green salad leaves. The short finish picks over corn cake mix and cream soda. Power but not enough finesse from the wood here. £64"
3348,10,"One might speculate about the initial qualities of this young grain prior to its sherry cask finish. While it boasts a richer color the nose is reminiscent of roast beef plasticine wet dog and bruised raspberries. In the mouth it has good weight though mouth puckering with some brief rubbery notes early on before showing strawberry bubblegum sugar crystals black cherry rhubarb faint coffee notes and an ever-growing pepperiness. An enjoyable finish of baked apple and star anise. (727 bottles) £44"
3349,10,"The entry level official Girvan is named after their ‘MPS’ distillation apparatus that distills at various pressures and under vacuum to vaporize and distill at lower temperatures. This is very light with fresh whole pineapples orange fondant creams delicate vanilla and risen dough. It’s fiendishly sweet (have a dental hygienist on standby) like a deep layer of butter frosting sticky cotton candy honey overripe bananas and spearmint. The expeditious finish tenders cookie mix digestive biscuits and a grind of pepper. £45"
3350,10,"Papier mâché adhesives lemongrass green cardamom peanut pear and other aromatic fruity characteristics create a puzzling aroma profile. On sipping there is fruity baked apple sherbet and glowing light citrus notes of orange grapefruit and lime with a medium weight structure. The flavors tip toward a slight sour fruit note but as this flattens out creaminess rules. The finish suffers a short quick death leaving mild sour fruit. Water brings crystallized lemon on the nose and sweeter light fruits. £63"
3351,10,"Boldly this is naturally colored (barely colored) 3 year old grain whisky presented in a tall clear bottle. The predominant aroma of corn husks is mixed with a sentimental schoolroom whiff of white glue peeled from the fingertips. There’s wheat cracker bread cooked ham dripping foliage and chopped parsley. A clean refreshing mouthfeel with pleasant marshmallow sweetness is nixed by flavors of corn sliced bread and vanilla but they are hastily extinguished. A finishing spicy glimmer shuts down quickly too."
3352,10,"Squished rosehip nuttiness and seasoned wood but there is little else of note on this one. The palate has corn sweetness red fruits pomegranate cherry lips and descends into soor ploom territory with more oak wood. The finish continues the woody theme with a residual baked apple note.  Port Dundas can be wonderful to drink but with no shortage of good to great grain whisky on the market I feel this one is past its best. (258 bottles) £90"
3353,9,"Its best attributes are vanilla toasted coconut and tropical fruit but the rest of this grain whisky is a bit of a disappointment. It is thin and at times harsh. A paint thinner component is evident (especially on the nose) along with more wood on the finish than this thin body can handle. Two Carsebridge grain Scotch whiskies from Duncan Taylor which I have tasted recently were much better: richer and creamier and with more balance."
3354,12,"Marrying fruit and pastry aromas the first whiff brings angel food cake topped with strawberries which soon develop into a jammier presentation. There are also notes of mango pineapple and guava along with currants dried chile dry oak and caramel. On the palate strawberry jam and sweet mango balance out chewy oak chile heat mocha and rich spice sliding into a wave of spice tropical fruit smoked almonds and cocoa powder on the finish."
3355,12,"A peculiar nose of cucumber cinnamon Red Hots cedar shavings fresh melon jasmine tea and tobacco barn and somehow it all works. There’s much complexity to be explored here with a whole spice cabinet tumbling out on the palate dusting black tea Cherry Coke pecans espresso and taut oak with its clouds of blooming flavor. The finish expresses lovely barrel char red chiles coffee beans herbaceous pops of licorice and a lingering incense quality. Enchanting. (1000 bottles)"
3356,12,"Round ripe fruit flavors permeate this robust whiskey finished in port casks. Rich caramel-apple cider on the nose along with red candy apple toasted almonds cinnamon raisin bread and earthy spice. It's brightly fruity on the palate showing off berries green apple candy dried figs and Welch's grape juice as well as ample spice dark chocolate and nuts. Persistent grape and strawberry into the finish along with roasted walnuts warming spice and rich chocolaty oak."
3357,12,"The oloroso and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks that this whiskey was finished in present themselves right up front with raisins dried figs marmalade blackcurrants leather cinnamon allspice and dried chile on the nose. The full somewhat tannic palate is savory and sweet all at once juxtaposing dark fruit ample spice figs raisins and marmalade with hazelnuts almonds mole sauce and tobacco. Transitioning into the finish peppery spice dried fruit dark chocolate mocha cigar and rich oak highlight the finesse and balance this whiskey pulls off with aplomb."
3358,12,"Don’t try to be macho and slug this without water; you’ll miss out on its best characteristics. Totally neat it’s quite good but constrained by the numbing alcohol. Add some water and unlock flavors that continue to develop: tropical fruit cinnamon stick dark chocolate and caramel on the nose and more fruit nuts eucalyptus and bitter herbs on the palate. It has a juicy mouthwatering character with water capped off by the well-integrated finish of charred oak roasted pineapple eucalyptus and coffee beans."
3359,12,"Perfumed with orange blossoms and dripping with nectar the nose also has watermelon pistachio pudding coconut vanilla bean and apple-scented tobacco; new aromas reveal themselves with every sniff. Tropical fruit mingles with dried chiles cocoa powder coffee bean barrel char cinnamon and jalapeños on the palate. The finish has good length highlighting chile-chocolate coffee bean charred oak and grilled pineapple. Warming and complex with good development though it never feels heavy."
3360,12,"Persimmon pudding guava juice baked apple blueberry and pineapple on the nose as well as fresh clay pencil shavings cocoa powder cinnamon and salty ham. The palate is big and chewy with Popsicle stick dried chile roasted nuts black pepper and juicy guava and pineapple. More tropical fruit rounds out the palate mingling with pepper nuts and plenty of dry oak."
3361,12,"The nose shows glorious maturity with tropical fruits blueberry concord grape jelly and pineapple soda all mingled with wood spice dried chile and smoked meat. Excellent consistency into the palate which benefits from water to tame oak tannins; juicy pineapple guava papaya jackfruit and hibiscus tea brighten up cocoa powder and chile flavors. It finishes floral and fruity with persistent chili chocolate and cigar notes. Multilayered and rewarding."
3362,2,"Bitter and dry with a hint of charred oak on the nose along with dried apricots lemon iced tea and candied orange slices. The palate starts with drying oak tannins but is balanced offering black cherry pie mint cloves baked apple spiced chocolate and cinnamon. The finish has hints of oak char chocolate caramel dark fruit and a burst of baking spice at the end. A delicious sipping whiskey. (200 bottles)"
3363,12,"Opening with fresh grain aromas it soon develops to show complex cinnamon clove chai black tea dried orange peel and smoked salt; delicate pastry notes also appear. The palate is rich roasty and hot without water offering dark chocolate dried chiles barbecued brisket cacao nibs charred nuts and peppery spice that starts as a small flame and builds into a burn on the warming chocolaty ashy finish. (1200 bottles)"
3364,12,"The official debut of the distillery’s 100% own-make single malt. The nose has an earthy expression of the grain and works in heady aromas of guava pomegranate blueberries and kiwi along with sandalwood soap. It’s oily and silky in the mouth with forthright lemon and orange oil guava and kiwi as well as dried leaves nutty tobacco and peppery spice. The finish is gentle and fades slowly with lemon oil milk chocolate and a hint of ashy charred nuts. (9600 bottles)"
3365,2,"Orange blossom tropical notes of lime pineapple and guava as well as fruitcake powdered sugar maple syrup and balanced oak on the nose. More tropical notes and powdered sugar follow on the palate along with hot chocolate roasted nuts grain notes pepper and barrel char. Light tropical flavors return on a long finish interwoven with chocolate tobacco and barrel notes. Unconventional and intensely racy with an intriguing complex interplay of diverse flavors."
3366,12,"Smoke acts as an emulsifier of fruit nut and oak flavors in this deceptively delicate whisky. Toasted marshmallows pound cake crème brûlée cinnamon Red Hots and earthiness on the nose; water brings out candied pineapple. Sweet smoke and tropical fruit are well-integrated on the palate with salty and mouthwatering flavors of grilled fruit and blueberry jam. Over time more oak and nuttiness emerge wafting into a gentle burnt marshmallow and toasted-walnut finish. 1083 bottles"
3367,12,"The sweet mineral herbal smoke of this whiskey is a rare treat calling up memories of the shells of grilled oysters smudging a bundle of sage and lightly charring marshmallows over a campfire. Subtly smoky on the palate well-woven with sweet confectionary notes of meringue candy cigarettes and powdered dried lemon zest. It finishes mild and still sweet vanilla and coconut on the final breath. Curious unique and delightful."
3368,12,"This whiskey shows no reticence in asserting a unique and frankly thrilling personality from first sniff: tea leaves coconut brown sugar saline raspberry plum cinnamon incense and the freshness of a cedar-filled forest rush out of the glass. Such layered complexity—belying its 18-month age statement—carries ably into the palate which is fruit-filled with dark plums and berries lush with dark chocolate and baking spice and tannic with oak and tea leaves. The well-balanced finish showcases dark chocolate sandalwood subtle spices and cigar wrapper. Very approachable. (600 bottles)"
3369,12,"Spice forms the foundation from start to finish. Allspice cloves and cinnamon Red Hots are interwoven with caramel-coated shortbread dark chocolate and walnuts on the nose. Zingy and lively on the palate with cinnamon allspice cloves sandalwood nuts and semi-sweet chocolate. With water the flavors deepen adding burnt sugar vanilla bean orange oil and roasted nuts. The spices fade with a slow burn mingling with sturdy oak and coffee bean. (3000 bottles)"
3370,12,"As American single malt ascends Balcones shows its leadership with this triumphant offering. It’s bursting with tropical fruits—kiwi mango guava jackfruit—buttressed by undercurrents of cinnamon dried chiles blueberry muffins and nuts. Those juicy ripe fruits remain intense on the palate two-stepping with cocoa powder barrel char roasted pecans and black pepper; the dance sweeps into a lengthy finish of grilled pineapple mocha and tobacco tapering off into bitter chocolate and oak. Balcones is putting both American single malt and the state of Texas on the map. Number 17 in the 2020 Top 20"
3371,2,"Virgin Garry oak matured 36% of this peated single malt and 64% was matured in new American oak. Whiffs of powdered candy bonfire smoke grilled meat dried strawberries and antique shop on the nose. A robust diverse palate features vanilla allspice cooked peaches black tea candle wax and bitter chocolate as the smoke drifts into the background but never leaves lingering into the finish to play against notes of honeycomb vanilla cream and cooked red fruits. (5625 bottles)"
3372,12,"Sweet smoky brisket brown-sugar bacon vanilla bean nutmeg buttered pecans milk chocolate dried strawberries and spearmint swirl on the expressive nose of this mesquite-smoked single malt and there’s more of the same on the palate: minty freshness nutty milk chocolate vanilla dried red fruits and sweet smoke. The oak turns mouthwatering into the peppery cinnamon-hot yet minty-cool finish where vanilla smoke lingers longest. (785 bottles)"
3373,12,"An intriguing first release from one of craft beer’s most inventive producers. Like many whiskeys made by brewers this one’s charm is in its deceptive simplicity that reveals successively complex character with every sip. The rum-cask finish is evident throughout: caramel-banana sundae marzipan and pistachio pudding on the nose along with rose petals meringue and a touch of suntan lotion. The palate has fresh banana rose water pistachio kheer almonds lemon and lime sherbet. Oak asserts itself on the perfumy elegant finish."
3374,2,"Each release of the limited-edition Reverie series will be different from the last as Westland explores the boundaries of single malt blending. Spice and fragrant oak on the nose delicately floral with light fruitiness on the palate and a hint of peat. A spicy white pepper note precedes a lengthy finish of apricot honeycomb and then more spiciness. This whiskey floats like a butterfly but has plenty of heft depth and balance. (900 bottles; distillery only)"
3375,12,"Tropical and floral on the nose with kiwi mango hibiscus coconut cream and pistachio and almond halva; add water and a big burst of honeysuckle blooms. There are more tropical notes on the palate: melon guava pineapple and Juicy Fruit as well as almond coffee ice cream milk chocolate and spice. The mouthfeel is robust becoming mouthwatering on the finish which is oak-led but balanced with floral hop character."
3376,2,"A limited-release preview of the distillery’s first American single malt label Courage & Conviction which will launch in April 2020. Aged at least 3 years in sherry bourbon and cuvée wine casks this whiskey has a malty nose with notes of dried fruit wood spice lime and pineapple. Baked apples figs vanilla and baking spice on the palate with a honeyed finish of toffee toasted oak and almond. A deft balance of barrel influences. (4200 bottles)"
3377,12,"The nose says gentle and light: banana cream pie Nilla wafer lemon custard bubble gum pineapple soda blanched almonds white flowers pistachio and graham cracker crust. But the palate is rich and robust with nuts tobacco mocha gingerbread and vibrant spice to counter the banana almond and vanilla-chocolate shake sweetness. The finish is short but satisfying with spiced pecans cigar semi-sweet chocolate and mocha. (3750 bottles)"
3378,2,"The third release of Westland’s single malt aged in native Garryana oak from the Northwest. Supply limits meant the wood was used more as a finishing agent this year but the results are impressive. The nose has woodsmoke eucalyptus dark chocolate espresso blackberry and lemon zest. The palate is toasty with cocoa powder berries cinnamon and chili pepper finishing with more dark chocolate and espresso. A lot going on here and it’s all good."
3379,12,"Finished in 500-liter oloroso sherry casks this is one for the sherry lovers with sugared almond fig milk chocolate and candied fruit notes on the nose. The palate is rich with milk chocolate Toblerone grape soda raspberry coulis candied ginger almonds Fig Newtons and drying oak. It finishes sweet and silky with a hint of tobacco vanilla and delicate dried fruit."
3380,12,"Sweet barbecue smoke vanilla bean milk chocolate sesame breadstick grilled apples and charred peppers on the nose. On the palate the smoke is sweet and savory a little meaty—grilled sausage—and supported by dark chocolate and tobacco leaf. There’s also lemon and orange oil raspberry vanilla and satisfying nuttiness. More sweet-savory smoke into the gently fading finish overlaid on cocoa powder mint leaf and vanilla. (2500 bottles)"
3381,12,"The nose presents a complex almost condensed array of aromas: cantaloupe vanilla Rocket Pop raspberry jam sandalwood tobacco leaf fancy mixed nuts and incense. Equally complex and layered on the palate which highlights herbal and delicate spice notes of clove mint cedar sandalwood and black pepper along with dark fruit—raspberry blackberry grape—and roasted nuts. Cacao nibs Andes mint chocolates clove nutmeg and charred oak overflow on the lengthy finish."
3382,11,"Some of the oldest American malt whiskey joins this 30th anniversary mingling finished in a pear eau de vie barrel a nod to the distillery’s origins. The nose is elegant deep and clearly touched by the pear and oak. There’s creaminess in the mouth a perfect weight rich nutty sweetness balanced by wood; it all slides into a warming finish and pear is all around. A bit too much pear actually; though I love pears that’s my one complaint."
3383,12,"From the first sniff this whiskey defines itself as intense and full-flavored: candied kiwi papaya mango pineapple and jackfruit crowd out almost all other aromas though if it sits for a while brown sugar and pecans emerge. The palate is consistent with plenty of tropical fruit but also cocoa powder oak and dry nuttiness. More pineapple kiwi and jackfruit on the finish but they fade fairly quickly to allow vanilla bean and dry oak to shine."
3384,0,"Mesquite-smoked New Mexico single malt. Rich and beefy on the nose: charred brisket salted meat tangerines dark wood brine and white smoke. The palate is powerful oak-forward without being astringent and very spicy. Walnut cayenne pepper and grilled citrus balance out the meaty oaky flavors. Saddle leather cherries and even more smoke on the finish. Tangy salty spicy and malty. A truly compelling American single malt with great structure."
3385,11,"This release is based on a mash done at Sierra Nevada brewery aged in eight different types of casks (including apple brandy and white wine) running from 4 to 15 years old. Delicate fruit nuts and sweet malt combine like perfect pastry in the nose. Add a bit of unsweetened chocolate on the palate finishing with a lingering reminiscence of every bit of flavor and you have a beautifully integrated whiskey that is unmistakably St. George. Delightful."
3386,12,"Sweet and lightly smoky on the nose: toasted marshmallow campfire logs Sugar Babies dried orange rind Nilla Wafer smoked almonds and rich hot chocolate. Without water the proof shows itself but add a few drops and what was a dry brush fire is now smoked chili-chocolate cinnamon black pepper orange oil almonds and a little bacon. Ashy and sweet on the finish with chili heat orange nuts and chocolate. Potentially divisive in its profile but its powerful character is undeniable."
3387,2,"The 20th annual limited release of St. George Spirits’ American single malt. An aromatic citrusy nose is almost tropical with complex notes of rancio lemon peel melon mango confectionery powder and candle wax. The palate is floral and delicate with subtle sweetness and overlays of lemon cake vanilla frosting and white pepper. Balanced fruit vanilla and notes of baking spice on a long finish."
3388,12,"Most American single malts aren’t aiming to recreate the flavors of scotch but this well-balanced whiskey made in San Jose could easily blend into an Islay lineup. Briny with rubbery mineral peat on the nose along with lemon peel Asian pear red apple grilled pineapple and beach bonfire. The palate is sweet and savory with salty peat burnt ends charred nuts tobacco lemon peel and black pepper. It finishes nutty with tobacco espresso pepper and lingering smoke."
3389,12,"A vibrant nose thanks in part to Hillrock’s on-site malting floor and kiln: baby back ribs grilled corn tobacco leaf pecans nutmeg figs and clean mineral smoke. The dry palate is savory smoky and mouthwatering with spiced nuts grilled sausages orange oil grilled apples clove nutmeg and hints of rubber. It finishes with coffee ice cream smoked salt tobacco leaf dark chocolate and lingering savory smoke. (60000 bottles)"
3390,12,"Oily lemon orange and grapefruit zested over an earthy malt base lead into a nose of leafy forest floor sliced apples on a crisp fall day toasted hazelnuts and banana bread with caramel drizzle. The palate is spiced with nutmeg and cinnamon savory with nutty toasted malt and tobacco leaf rich with dark chocolate and brightened by grapefruit oil. Espresso cigar wrapper cinnamon dark chocolate and persistent nutty oak to finish. (9900 bottles)"
3391,12,"Bakery shop aromas pervade the nose: vanilla frosting almond cream apple pie a la mode and lemon bars. There’s also rose petal perfume plums and red gummy bears. The creamy-textured palate showcases nutty pastry buttered scone toasted almonds vanilla and candied orange peel; water brings out cinnamon and Nesquik. Quick to finish with more nuts and vanilla but ultimately a satisfying conclusion. (1500 bottles)"
3392,8,"Dark tobacco horehound saddle leather mesquite smoke and dried fruits rightly suggest the intensity to come from this Arizona malt. The robust palate features grilled corn heaps of char and savory smoked meats with a burnt-sugar note that is both bitter and sweet. This is bold and flavor-packed like drinking a glass of brisket. The no-holds-barred finish displays campfire smoke milk chocolate and burning citrus oil. (1650 bottles)"
3393,12,"Town Branch was founded by an Irishman Pearse Lyons and you’d be forgiven for thinking this 100% malted barley whiskey hails from the Emerald Isle. Citrus confectionary and floral notes on the nose with almond pistachio and some forest floor and dried leaves. In the mouth a lively texture undergirds brown butter mixed nuts lemon zest and a hint of ginger. It finishes nutty and warm with a touch of cigar wrapper and leathery oak."
3394,8,"Dried leaves toasted nuts and plenty of fresh oak emerge from this big broad-shouldered malt that ably handles all the new oak that’s been thrown at it with the solid wood structure propping up pretty orange pekoe tea buttered toast biscuity malt caramel and chocolate flavors. Finishes with dark toasted spices and anise. A distinctly oaky American interpretation of single malt that is both bold and balanced. (5000 bottles)"
3395,2,"A blast of peat bonfire starts on the nose before moving into more subtle peat on the palate. Here it creates a delicate overlay to notes of vanilla toasted marshmallow peaches and cream dried red fruits and pepper. The finish offers length more dried red fruits peat and peppery spice with an earthy note of char at the end. Delicate refined and balanced particularly in light of its relative youth. (6192 bottles)"
3396,8,"This doles out big pot still character from the start and feels like it’s taking a deep cut into the distillate lending a bold and somewhat rustic note that suggests rhum agricole. The nose has smoky and vegetal notes that border on rubber tire adding a fair amount of intrigue to the nutty malt lurking just below. Generous in body with sweet vanilla and a fudge-like finish. (1350 bottles)"
3397,0,"Soft and juicy aromas of ginger juice apple tart strawberry shortcake and light sweet smoke. Very aromatic with lots of citrus clove and cinnamon. Orange Creamsicle on the palate with a good deal of apple poached pear marmalade and light smoke. Salted butter gentle oak and wispy smoke keep this in balance. A good harmony of flavors."
3398,2,"The nose starts with pleasant floral and lemon peel overtones as well as an herbal note leading to aromas of macaroons and confectionery powder. Sweet notes of lemon cookie sugared almonds and cinnamon ride across the palate with water coaxing out spice and bitter chocolate. Fresh vanilla cookies punctuate the finish with an integrated array of baking spice tiramisu chocolate babka cinnamon bun and lemon. Balanced complex sweetness melding with citrus and spice."
3399,12,"The nose balances enticing aromas of tropical fruit—mango jackfruit papaya—with earthy clay and dark chocolate a harbinger of the bright sweetness of the palate which sings with grapefruit lemon-lime zest kiwi and pineapple soda plus roasted nuts and semi-dark chocolate. The texture is waxy verging to oily with a few drops of water but never heavy. Though the finish is short it’s complete rounded out with white pepper jackfruit and grapefruit oil."
3400,12,"At first the nose is earthy and roasty with dried chile cocoa powder toasted oak curing tobacco and dried clay but a few drops of water reveal dried jasmine honeysuckle and rose petals: a delightful surprise. The palate is savory and earthy with plenty of mole sauce cocoa powder charred nuts and pepper. It’s lengthy on the finish unfurling into cigar espresso and unsweetened cocoa flavors."
3401,12,"Though anchored in earthy and woodsy aromas of birch and soil tropical fruits also burst forth from the glass: guava kiwi pineapple mango and jackfruit ripe and ready to be enjoyed. They carry through to the palate along with a touch of citrus Cherry Coke syrup roasted pecans and ample spice and are persistent into the mouth-coating finish which counterbalances cloying flavors with charred nuts and oak."
3402,12,"The nose is reticent and doesn’t yield much but candied lemon peel strawberry grape soda and jasmine perfume emerge. It’s super sweet and fruity on the palate like a bag of Skittles; guava pineapple mango kiwi and cantaloupe shine with a length of oak to temper the effusive brightness. The finish is fairly short and overall a bit more muted than the palate suggests."
3403,12,"This smells like nothing so much as instant oatmeal of the maple and brown sugar variety—sweet cereal buttressed by fresh-hewn oak orange marmalade and a sprinkling of cinnamon. The palate does well given a bit of water and time to open up revealing maple syrup almond milk chocolate cinnamon orange peel and a hint of tobacco as well as new wood. More tobacco like the end of a cigar on the finish along with milk chocolate and persistent oak."
3404,2,"The nose is herbal with notes of bitter lime lemon peel hops peppermint green apple and hints of salinity. The mouthfeel is smooth with flavors of honey chocolate cake and cinnamon plus notes of lemon blossom confectioners’ sugar and baking spice. A long finish offers vanilla cream and crackling bitter herbs. Light and fruity—sometimes almost tropical—with a grip of appealing spice on the finish. (6000 bottles)"
3405,12,"An herbaceous and savory whiskey with an expressive nose: fennel licorice roasted lemon and clementine peels new leather and dark berries. The finish makes itself evident from first sip with a chewy texture and flavors of dark chocolate nocino liqueur black licorice orange oil and allspice. The finish has good length with more dark chocolate fennel roasted nuts polished oak and pipe tobacco."
3406,8,"A perfumed nose of lilac mint orange flower water and powdery Sweethearts candy introduces this pretty whiskey as distinctive tangerine citrus meets papaya and tropical flavors. The malty palate is broad sweet and pure delivering some bubble gum and confectionery notes. Very enjoyable and almost juicy in its fruit bomb of flavors."
3407,11,"Ages range from 4 to 16 year old whiskeys; seven types of cask 100% malt (mashed at Sierra Nevada Brewing). Solid hefty malt nose with fruit dressing and a fleeting hint of baking spices. A much weightier more serious whiskey this year; the malt is meaty savory with an edge from the wine oak and even a hint of brine toward the end. I miss last year’s balance and relaxed nature though; there’s an air of trying too hard here. (3000 bottles)"
3408,2,"Candied strawberries dried flowers and light nuttiness on the nose. The palate features semi-sweet chocolate espresso beans spice cake cantaloupe slices coffee ice cream and a malty note. The finish offers good length and exudes notes of dried red berries spice bitter chocolate cocoa powder and light influences of roasted grain oak and tobacco leaf. The latter notes meld with the sweetness and spice creating a complex alluring balance."
3409,2,"This American single malt is aged in two separate bourbon barrels—one new and one used. A malty earthy nose of slate is followed by notes of coriander and orange peel as well as iced tea ginger and dark chocolate. The palate offers espresso bitter orange more chocolate and grilled pineapple. A long rich finish of orange mocha black pepper and pipe tobacco. Rich malty and flavorful—some enjoyable sipping here."
3410,12,"Roasted apples cherry danish walnuts dark caramel and grape jelly on the nose with more bakery notes emerging after water is added; deep oak is prominent throughout. Tannic and chewy on the palate which leans more bitter than sweet with coffee beans and baking chocolate underscored by a savory ashy character. Water pulls out more dark fruit and takes the finish from rough to rounded."
3411,2,"The nose is light floral and hoppy; sweet on top with hints of licorice stone fruit bubble gum and honeydew. The palate is also light with a silky texture that offers notes of chocolate-covered marshmallows plums nectarines and hot cocoa with whipped cream. Smooth and balanced on the finish if perhaps a bit light with lingering hoppiness toasted grain and cigar wrapper sweetened by vanilla and tropical fruit notes. (3300 bottles)"
3412,8,"Exhibits the floral rose petal and fresh meadow character often found in St. George malts. The palate pours with white peach and apricot coupled with warm cereal notes. A delicate whiskey that might have benefited from higher proof but remains enjoyable for its lingering sweetness elegant character and unmistakable craftsmanship."
3413,8,"A true American single malt; the impression of new charred barrels distinguishes this from its Old World counterparts while the creamed honey caramel and candied nuts keep the wood in check. On the palate the wood influence delivers big vanilla and hints of smoky char coupled with nicely concentrated flavors of Turkey Golden table syrup fruit and spice. A nice rendition of New World single malt showing proof and gusto."
3414,8,"This holds real promise for the scotch lover. Interesting vanillin oak peaty phenols and adhesive bandage balance the generous sweet malt foundation. Robust on the palate but far from fiery the mouth coating peat takes charge of the marshmallow-sweet malt before dusty cocoa and dark chocolate win out across the long finish. Like other Westland efforts this tries hard on many fronts and succeeds on some. It’s hard to deduce what the Oregon Quercus Garryana oak actually brings to the whole."
3415,12,"Made using cuts that emphasize its peat and malt notes this starts off with a nose of brine seaweed and iodine but there’s a captivating tempting tropical fruitiness too. On the palate that tropical note shows up fleetingly as blueberry and pomegranate with peat continuing to commandeer the ship into an ashy finish of coffee bean black pepper and dark chocolate. (1200 bottles)"
3416,0,"A dry smoke led by brisket dry oak and cherries. Sweetly smoky in the mouth with black pepper cayenne and barbecue flavors as well as grilled fruits nectarines and charred plums. A good balance of sweet and spicy with a backbone of minerality. The mesquite flavor amps up in the long and spicy finish."
3417,11,"After twelve years it’s time for a revisit. No age statement; aged in a variety of woods. The whiskey is a pale gold and has a pleasantly sweet and layered nose; honeycomb dried apricot sugar cookies and hints of an ice wine richness. It’s a bit hot for 43% which robs the palate of some complexity but that honeyed fruit and cookie is there in the mouth too. Overall quite nice indeed."
3418,12,"Tropical fruit on the verge of overripeness: pineapple papaya kiwi plus jasmine flowers almond halva and the piney-lemon aroma of hops. The hoppiness is evident on the palate which is light in body and consequently less expressive in flavor though there’s dry nuttiness and grain overlaid with sweeping tropical fruit. More of the same hoppy juicy fruit flavors juxtaposed with oak on the finish. If you like beery whiskey this is one to try. (10000 bottles)"
3419,2,"Herbal and peppery on the nose offering dill licorice guava and green banana as well as a hint of mint and black cherry cough medicine. The mouthfeel is somewhat tart with burnt espresso beans bitter chocolate and a note of toasted almond. A long finish of caramel and bitter chocolate as well as charred bitter hoppy notes melds with a sweet honeyed and syrupy taste and texture. A fascinating flavor progression."
3420,12,"A shy nose that tends toward doughy aromas: saffron buns with lightly sprinkled spices coconut-flaked vanilla macaroons Nilla wafers and rice pudding plus chalky candy cigarettes and talcum powder. Graham cracker Luden’s cherry cough drop candied orange peel and vanilla on the palate; the flavors are nice if simple. Chocolate-cherry cordial cinnamon and toasted almonds to finish. An uncomplicated pour."
3421,12,"Cooked malt roasted chestnuts and cigar box aromas mingle with caramel-nut clusters brown sugar grilled fruit and new oak. It’s rich and roasty with a velvety texture on the palate; the malt takes center stage highlighted by bright citrus and herbaceous pine as well as cooked fruit and hints of tobacco with prominent oak flavors. Chocolate-covered candied orange peel and roasted nuts mingle with cigar on the finish."
3422,12,"Fruit-forward on the nose with stewed prunes and spiced apple cake as well as rose potpourri cinnamon sassafras and chai masala. The palate is oak-led with red fruit chocolate spice walnuts almonds vanilla syrup and sliced lemon. More oak on the finish along with mocha dark chocolate walnuts and cinnamon apple."
3423,12,"Plummy earthy and zingy with grapefruit and pine aromas along with orange marmalade raspberry and hazelnut. Light-bodied and silky in the mouth it has flavors of lemon cake hazelnut milk chocolate and intense floral and fruity hops as well as sweet plum and mocha notes. This whiskey’s beauty is in its delicate balance although it may veer too far out of the middle lane for conventional palates."
3424,8,"Aromas of woodsmoke with hints of hot tar and rubber are draped over ripe berry fruit. Dark and somewhat brash it comes off a touch hot fully revealing its 100 proof becoming more fruit driven on the palate as sweet berry buckwheat honey and sorghum syrup give way to smoldering baking spice on the drying oak-laced finish. More muscle than finesse however the 21% Quercus garryana is revealing itself more in this second iteration."
3425,8,"Briney sea air wet stones and pretty wisps of campfire smoke give this a strong Scottish bent while the medium-bodied palate nicely balances the sweet malt salt and smoke in a bit of salt water taffy. Showing nice complexity and balance overall the finish smolders and evolves to become more herbaceous."
3426,8,"Earthy phenolic and herbaceous with a wisp of smoke and seaweed this is certainly characterful. The flavor marries malty sweetness red fruits and a peculiar smoke like a distant burning leaf pile or smoldering smoked jalapeños. While it tastes a bit young and it’s certainly unconventional this is a very intriguing whiskey with an ashy finish delivering cocoa and nutty notes. (9600 bottles)"
3427,12,"Partial maturation in barrels that held Rogue’s Rolling Thunder imperial stout lends this whiskey aromas of hops dry coffee grounds cocoa powder and vegetal earthiness; there’s also mesquite barbecue chips vanilla and amaretto. More beer-forward flavors on the palate along with spice and chocolate some dry nuttiness and citrus oil. It’s consistent from start to finish ending with piney hops oily citrus drying oak white pepper and roasted nuts."
3428,11,"All-malt double pot-distilled aged 2 years in new charred 53 gallon oak barrels. Nose has cereal and muted apple notes some light grassiness youthful. Exciting on the palate: hard candy vanilla oaky spice hints of maple; it’s a jubilance that doesn’t end but doesn’t get tiresome like some sugar-high toddler either. Finish is just more of the same which is okay but mildly disappointing. Well done but quite pricey. Price is per 375ml."
3429,8,"Hugely floral and perfumed on the nose with rose petals violet candies and dried orange peel. This is the Gewürztraminer of American single malts—sweet lychee laced with sachet aromas that explode as if opening Grandma’s dresser drawer. The palate is more tropical; dried pineapple canned peach syrup and spice. This could be polarizing but it’s utterly captivating and worth a try."
3430,8,"Floral and spice including orange blossom and clove this pours berry fruit on the palate before the chocolate malt balls set in. Seamless nicely done and certainly moreish as the clean drying finish gives way to biscuit brioche and pain au chocolat."
3431,9,"It shows nice maturity considering it contains whiskey as young as two years old. Smooth too with layered sweetness (honeyed caramel English toffee maple syrup) tangerine roasted nuts and peppered with spice (warming cinnamon glazed ginger). Good grip of tobacco and polished leather on the finish balances the sweetness that comes earlier. An example of the right way to do artisan distilling."
3432,11,"Hot tropical fruit warm band-aids and a mix of Dum-Dum lollipops in the nose. More sweet and creamy on the palate with a hint of the band-aids and dry grip of oak at the end. A fairly quick drink but a clean and layered one."
3433,11,"Brazen stuff blowing raw fresh-sawn oak (six months in small heavy char barrels) and cocoa/caramel right out of the glass. For all its youth it's drinkable; hot assertively oaky but drinkable thanks to the glowing depth of malt character in the glass. The oak's buoyed by rich cocoa-tinged toffee and the finish is like a very good hot chocolate. It's going like crazy; love to see where it would be in four years. Limited edition of 500 bottles. Price per 375 ml."
3434,8,"Sweet vanilla dried berries and a soft display of woodsmoke introduce this whiskey. While notably improved from earlier bottlings the sherry is still rendered a bit dull like chocolate-covered cherries as smoky cocoa nibs and the chewy malt meet on the palate offering a honeyed finish with hints of baking chocolate."
3435,11,"Nice color for a 10 year old. Puffing peat off the glass with briny notes and sweetness: promising. The promise is kept in the mouth too. It’s all there: peat smoke brine good round malt some fruity notes in the finish and a nice creamy texture. There’s a bit of astringency and it’s hot for the proof. Still a very convincing American iteration of a peated single malt especially at this age."
3436,7,"A non-age stated single malt from Washington State. Light amber in color there’s more oak on the nose than you’d expect along with baked apple chocolate cinnamon and clove. Chocolate leads the entry followed by clove cinnamon baked apple and salt. A spicy mid-palate picks up some ginger and a dash of heat. The finish is fairly short and dry. This feels a bit young and lacks depth. An interesting start; let's see where it goes from here."
3437,11,"Barrel 2 was aged in 15-gallon bourbon refills then finished in a Cedar Ridge rum barrel; interesting to see an American distiller walk away from “straight whiskey” with used (small!) cooperage. Aromas of sawdust toffee melon and just-ripe apricot dry cocoa and warm cereal fight a bit with alcohol heat. Rum and fruit float over malt and vanilla in the mouth and the wood rounds and dries. Oak and faint allspice in the finish. Needs some more taming; great start."
3438,11,"Hard to say what this is: the label just says “WHISKEY.” My nose though says “Irish whiskey.” Grassy malt sweet heat light pear esters. It's there in the mouth too: smooth sweet malt vaporous lift off the tongue Irish light elegance and a lingering finish with a slippery hint of vanilla. Considering the eponymous distiller is Irish... Nice stuff; now tell us more about it."
3439,9,"Soft gentle aroma with notes of vanilla wafers marzipan and bramble. Continued soft sweet and creamy on the palate with red and black currant pear subtle gin botanicals and lingering anise on the finish. Good oak grit for such a young whisky which helps to balance the sweetness. Fairly straightforward as would be expected with such youthfulness but very enjoyable. I wonder if this whisky is peaking at eight years old (or at least reached a plateau)? Certainly mature enough to enjoy now but I would be curious to see this at 12 years old where it might gain some additional depth and complexity providing the oak is kept in check."
3440,11,"The price the proof and 8 years of age reflect the source: the Triple 8 distillery. Light fruit — white grapes nectarine — and a bit of resiny plastic in the nose plus a hint of wine wood underlain by malt. Clean malt in the mouth well-integrated with nothing sticking out or unbalanced. The fruit’s still there but diminished; finish is a little clingy but clean. Nicely-made whisky…but it’s like a really good dish of vanilla ice cream; is that all?"
3441,11,"Young malt whisky. A rich but jumbled nose: cocoa ripe grape oak and vanilla tumble and fight for your attention. A nicely rounded lighter whiskey in the mouth though and the cocoa cradles malt sweetness quite nicely...until the oak tears up the finish with a blast of hot spice. You almost want to keep sipping continuously to keep the finish from cutting in. Price is per 375ml."
3442,9,"A special batch of Stranahan’s aged in Hungarian oak. The distillery is doing a lot of experimenting with aging their whiskey in different wine barrels. I really like how this one turned out. Nicely sweet with honey-drenched fruit golden raisin cotton candy caramel apple Jordon almonds and grape skins. Good grip -- and a little funky -- on the finish (nothing too assertive though) which cuts through the sweetness. Not a polished whiskey but certainly an adventure! (Available only at the distillery.)"
3443,9,"A unique and quite intriguing whiskey. A “bottle ready” California pilsner beer was given an extra dose of hops then distilled in a pot still and aged in new oak for six years. Then it was “aged” in stainless steel for another three years. Five barrels were bottled. When I traveled through Europe some of the breweries let me taste “Hop Schnapps” they’d had a distiller produce from their own beer. It was always just for their own private consumption not for sale. This Charbay release reminds me of that only aged into a mature whiskey. It’s a complex whiskey naturally accentuated by hops exotic teas marijuana (seriously!) candied fruit lavender dark berries raspberry (red and black) juniper freshly ground tellicherry pepper and light Caribbean rum. A nice “change of pace” whiskey."
3444,11,"Woodstone’s using a local brewer’s beer as the basis for this one. Intriguing nose: grainy sweet but also a bit green/herbaceous. That's quite tasty! The malt comes through broad and sweet the herbal character floats over the top and perks up the taste buds almost like a digestif. The finish is tinged with honey and herbs but dries up nicely. Smooth for the proof too."
3445,9,"Made from 100% malted barley (wash from the adjacent Flying Dog brewery) and aged for a minimum of two years. Surprisingly good for such a young whisky. Layers of sweetness (honey caramel toffee) with some nutty/nougat notes bourbon-like charred oak and background spice. Some youthful “burn” emerges toward the latter half of the palate -- a little careful aging would smooth out the finish and add depth. Still a very nice effort."
3446,7,"This young peated malt aged at least 24 months has a nice dry peat smoke nose backed by honey and oak. On the palate it’s disjointed: the young peat malt argues with the heavy char barrel a struggle that needs more time to be worked out. Honeyed malt tries to lend support but everything topples in the mid-palate where things turn dry spicy and slightly acidic. A medium finish wraps up a whiskey that simply needs more time."
3447,7,"With a mash featuring no less than six different kinds of malt and aged in four different barrels (two sherry a bourbon and heavy-char new American oak) there are lot of moving parts with this whiskey. A jammy inviting nose features blackberry jam raisin apricot and ginger. On the palate it’s a cacophonic mess: chocolate and peated malt clash and do battle to grab focus. Add some heavy char and sherry to the mix and it's a bloodbath."
3448,10,"Produced at the De Molenberg Distillery from a mash of Gouden Carolus Tripel beer and finished in Anker beer casks following bourbon-barrel maturation. This has aromas of peach barley marshmallow light toffee hops and warm apple pie with dry and fragrant spices. Melon overripe pear white chocolate vanilla pod cinnamon stick baked apple dried orange oak and spices on the palate; the unfolding flavors are generous and strong."
3449,9,"Very mature for its age and with great personality. It’s a fun lively whisky with tropical fruit (banana peach coconut) pineapple upside down cake spring flowers soft honeyed vanilla fruit gumdrops and chamomile tea. Clean light and slightly warming finish. Lovely now but a whisky with great potential!  Price:31 (Sold in a three pack consisting of new make spirit 1 year old spirit and 3 year old whisky: only in Belgium.)€31"
3450,12,"Smoked almonds marzipan fig-studded chocolate vanilla sugar and flan on the nose—quite sweet and dessert-like but grounded in earthy char. Robust full-bodied and almost juicy with flavor it shows red fruit almonds figs dark chocolate flan black pepper and cigar ash on the palate finishing with more ash oak and dark fruit—so carefully structured it might well have been designed on a blueprint. Distilled by The English Whisky Co. and bottled by Virginia Distillery Co. (243 bottles)"
3451,10,"A heady mix of floral notes and soft fruits with fresh cereal notes and aromas of sweet pea orange honey apricot and papaya on this French oak-matured whisky. This begins gracefully as a soft creamy single malt with flavors of vanilla caramel and condensed milk becoming denser with scrumptious biscuit and chocolate flavors (think Twix bars) as it slowly reveals its secrets."
3452,4,"Any lingering doubts that English whisky means business are dispelled by this whisky masterclass. This is a New Orleans show band of a whisky bursting with vibrancy and happy celebratory notes. The cask is all over this with rum and raisin milk chocolate and mocha contributing to an all-round sweet treat. Not too sweet though; and the malt at the center of this sings. £65"
3453,10,"It’s quite a tick list for their first single malt: 100% locally grown floor-malted barley long fermentations unusual yeast strains innovative distillation cuts and bourbon and shave-toast-rechar red wine casks. Honey sugar-sprinkled shortbread peach tarts marzipan fruits glacé apricot finely shredded citrus peel and young pink rhubarb. Flavors of heather honey chili flakes Christmas spices caramelized sugar malt; then marmalade dried red fruits and cappuccino. A great all-rounder. More please! (960 bottles)"
3454,10,"Dhavall Ghandhi’s latest one-off creation uses casks that held colheita (single vintage aged tawny port). Fragrant and appealing with spices apple jelly pink Turkish delight plums warm coffee grounds Seville orange peel forest honey and cedar boxes. Flavors of cherry toffee pepper clove and an early surge of high alcohol it develops a creamy mouthfeel with cranberry sultana and sweet cinnamon buns finishing with leather tobacco and prune juice. £65"
3455,4,"In the UK Trick or Treat is still linked to Halloween and all things spooky. So this unlucky 13 is at 49% (4+9) and is priced in British pounds at £66.60. It just happens to be the best thing the distillery has done so far. The extra strength lots of honeycomb sweetness and a big hit of peat make this a coming of age whisky with no immaturity and bags of great flavors. £67"
3456,10,"Muscular with high alcohol and a nose of peppercorns chile flakes barbecue spice rub savory brisket bark and beef jerky. The palate is sweeter with honeydew spices surfing the cask-strength wave then flavors of sugared pastries vanilla baked lemon and orange zest. This shines as is or add a dash of water for a really satisfying drink. (254 bottles)"
3457,10,"Malt barns cornflakes some sparse vanilla redskin peanuts citrus peel and a dash of white pepper on the nose. The overall impression on the olfactory system is gentle and mild. A tasty prospect with poached pear vanilla ice cream honeydew peppery spices ground almond custard tarts lemon zest malt and peanut brittle. A little tangy citrus deep warmth and vanilla to finish. Rather moreish. (480 bottles)"
3458,10,"Distiller Dariusz Plazewski’s policy of small-batch and single-cask releases has built a loyal following for Bimber. This one has lush caramel and dried banana on waffles faint milk chocolate notes red chile and toasted oak though the aromas are ring-fenced by peppery spices and strong alcohol. On the palate the initial dark plum fruits are joined by pepper caramelized sugar and Smucker’s Magic Shell chocolate topping. (253 bottles)"
3459,1,"Gold in color and sweet on the nose with a little nudge of mash stewed apples and cobnuts. As it develops the impression is of a polite garden tea at the minister’s: vanilla sponge scones with cream and strawberry jam with a background of lightly-turned earth. The palate continues equally sweetly and is lightly hot when neat. A glimpse of summer pleasures in wintertime."
3460,10,"A creamy delight: rice pudding laden with swollen raisins brown sugar melting on hot porridge (if this were scotch it would be salt). It begins sweet with a juicy fruitiness before a rodeo of spiciness bucks on the tip of the tongue. The texture is creamy and light but substantial enough to carry these big flavors. Dried lemon and double cream stretch out into a lengthy finish. A unique profile but a fitting tribute. (1499 bottles) £50"
3461,10,"This lives up to its name with leaf bonfire smoke vanilla essence and ginger preserves. Distiller David Fitt chooses malt peated to the same level as Port Ellen maltings delivers to Laphroaig. Assertive flavors of raw ginger peppercorn and chili flakes succumb to soothing vanilla cream and herbal notes. It leaves a creaminess on the lips and a mouth-coating finish of bonfire smoke and ground pepper. (480 bottles)"
3462,10,"Dedicated to Dr. Jim Swan who encouraged Cotswolds Distillery to shave toast and re-char red wine barriques this has developed aromas of cherry dried goji berries rose petal vanilla cake mix butterscotch and muted spices. It still feels young at this mighty strength. Warm red fruits of cherry and strawberry slam into a distortion of allspice clove and tongue-searing alcohols which are quelled eventually by sweet notes of creamy toffee and mint. (3000 bottles) £65"
3463,4,"You'll struggle to find this as it has been snapped up quickly but if you can don't miss out. This whisky was originally made by Iain Henderson is bottled at 5 years old and marks a significant step forward for this fledgling distillery. The sappy notes have retreated and are being replaced by a wonderful sweet lemon and creamy vanilla whisky. The pinprick pepper adds a delightful dimension. £65"
3464,4,"This is set to be the first proper release into the American market and it's a good introduction point with all the distillery characteristics on display and a delightful rustic peat base to set it all off. On the nose there is trademark sweet citrus and cracked pepper though they're joined here by milk chocolate and creamed lime and on the palate there's sweet lemon and lime sherbet fruit cordial and peat. £50"
3465,4,"St. George’s hits pay dirt! The competition is fierce for young big oily heavily peated whiskies: Kilchoman Connemara Turf Mor BenRiach Birnie Moss. This though is good enough to mix it in that sort of company. The peat growls like a Harley-Davidson punches pepper and peat throughout but best of all it flicks licorice and hickory kisses just like a real life Laphroaig. Chapter 11 isn’t quite in that league yet…but it’s certainly moving in the right direction. £65 (Currently not available in the U.S.)"
3466,10,"There is wonderfully sweet smoke on the nose that overrides a base layer of fresh mint and mounds of velvety cocoa powder. Neat there is a powerful alcohol kick a harbinger of sweet purple berry fruits and brown sugar before it settles down as it dilutes with pools of calming milky cocoa and chocolate. Give this a good splash of water and it will reward you handsomely unlocking extra layers of sweetness fresh melon and lime. (290 bottles The Whisky Exchange only) £62"
3467,4,"Another Royal occasion another excuse for a new bottling but this one justifies its existence because it brings tropical fruit and spice to the English whisky party. The nose is nothing to get excited about but there's rich pureed pear and some orange peel on the palate melon sweetness and cloves and cinnamon. It wraps up with some pleasant rustic earthiness. £80"
3468,4,"The Private Cellar range is a cask strength single cask range where St. George's can have some fun and dip a toe into uncharted waters. Triple distillation makes the whisky smoother sweeter and more rounded…which shouldn't work with the earthy rustic style of St. George’s. It does —big time. There are rum and raisin notes and a creaminess that masks the sappy youthfulness of the whisky (it's 5 years old).   £148"
3469,10,"Bimber makes light fruity whiskies from floor-malted English barley. This cask has aromas of millionaire’s shortbread rowanberry pomegranate a slightly bitter singed-spice note blackened oak and roasted chestnuts. Vanilla meets a formidable wall of alcohol on the palate with spicy peppercorn and chile flakes. Despite various dilutions it was hard to find a sweet spot but sweet pastries peach sherry wood and nut eventually emerge. (293 bottles)"
3470,6,"Gordon & MacPhail’s 1996 Tomatin was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. Malt fruit fondant black pepper then late vanilla and fudge on the nose. Peaches and apricots on the palate with vanilla and white pepper. The finish is spicy and medium in length with lasting orchard fruits. £57"
3471,10,"A marvelous red British telephone box adorns the label. A nose of pulped lemon and lime pineapple hard candy and Bramley applesauce certainly makes this a fruit-led proposition. It caresses the tongue with soft boiled apples and lemon cake flavors marking a crescendo in the perception of its strength; peaking with tropical fruits and touches of acidity pinching in from the periphery. Spicy heat icing sugars fig paste and hints of bitterness round off the finish. (270 bottles The Whisky Exchange only) £60"
3472,4,"Adnams brewery is known for two things in particular: a fearless approach to bold flavors and its investment in quality. Its other spirits are award winners but it's going to have to wait a little longer to repeat the trick with its single malt. This is just 3 years old and while it’s extremely well made and the maturation in virgin French oak ensures tastiness spice and sweet soft vanilla it hasn't fully realized its potential. £44"
3473,4,"Without doubt this distillery is developing a core style with peat the main variant over a grape gooseberry and lemon theme. This particular bottling is only available at the distillery and to some degree treads water after a series of great releases. The smoke is quite light but assertive and there's a pleasant spiciness on the palate to shake things up a little but it doesn't punch as effectively as Chapter 11 or the rum cask offering. £45"
3474,10,"Here talented distiller David Fitt shows us his latest expression of heavily peated whisky. The nose has jalapeño and bell peppers with pungent peat smoke that catches at the back of the throat. The smoke is sooty coal dust buoyed with some sweetness but without a medicinal edge to the phenols. Sipping brought lemon bonbons herbal elements and some burnt toast character. It swells out in the middle before relenting leaving a quenching sweet finish and a smoky aura. £45"
3475,4,"We’ve recorded the changing role of portwood use in whisky with Tasmania and the likes of Amrut and Penderyn putting it center stage. St. George's hasn't…yet. But port clearly has momentum because this has sold faster than the other two Founder's Private Cellar releases. Yet it doesn't quite work; the port is held in check so that the berry fruit compote the earthiness of the malt and a spearmint note clash with each other. £148"
3476,10,"Unripe pears honeycomb strawberry millefeuille and vanilla custard. A light and pleasant expression but it’s not the kind of complex dram that will hold your attention all night. This batch of unpeated 5 year old single malt from St. George was disgorged from just four American standard barrels and the taste consists of waxy lemons vanilla cream and banana splits with a growing caramel presence. A dry finish of light spices and sweet lemon. £45"
3477,4,"It was perhaps inevitable that a distillery employing whisky legend Iain Henderson would sooner or later release a heavily peated version of English whisky. Ironically this is the first release on which current distiller David Fitt has tweaked Henderson’s recipe. He has not let anyone down. The peat doesn’t hide the sappy youthfulness here but complements the sweet creamy malty heart building with pepper to good effect. Another step in the right direction for this intriguing distillery. £45 (Currently not available in the U.S.)"
3478,4,"Uh-oh. If I see the word “peated” with a sweet wine I get nervous. As a mix this is an accident waiting to happen; a great acrobatic trick that probably won't work. Two points here: one the distillery is defining its citrusy and gritty DNA despite the diversity of releases. Two this also pulls its punches…but it works. Yes it's very sweet and liqueury and yes there's peat — quite industrial here — but they stand on opposite sides of the dance floor and don't fight. £148"
3479,10,"This hothead stomps around the place lashing out the peaty punches but this raw power comes at the expense of balance. Coal scuttles crumbly compost smoked grass chocolate ganache and aromas of pit-cooked blackened joints of pork. A thin medley of lemon grapefruit and orange segments is smothered by dense plumes of smoke even more peaty with a dash of water and it billows its way to a finish of chalky fizzy candy round a bonfire. Imagine a smoked Trebor refresher. (964 bottles) £40"
3480,4,"Released to celebrate the wedding of Prince William and Kate it’s a combination of casks with the standard unpeated and peated English whiskies mixed with malt matured in a mix of casks. The nose is nothing special but the whisky is something else again. It’s initially bold spicy and assertive but swim over the first waves and there’s a calmer fruitier heart here. Another big step forward for an increasingly confident distillery."
3481,1,"The Norfolk-based English Whisky Company joins in the celebrations. It’s bright gold with a lovely sweetness to the nose fresh peach a little anise some lily of the valley and almond. There’s plenty happening on this light-to-medium base. The palate is clean with hazelnut and layers of flavor where succulent fruits play off the sweet spices. This is a distillery that as the Aussies say is hitting its straps. For me it’s their best release yet. £60"
3482,4,"The name’s a little misleading — this is actually the second whisky to be released from England’s only distillery. It’s only three years old so don’t expect too much depth but it’s a significant step up from the first release it’s made by legendary former Laphroaig distiller Iain Henderson and it’s peated so expect a treat. There’s not much happening on the nose with some fluffy fruit masking a touch of charcoal smoke. But on the palate it goes through the gears with melon and pear giving way to a wave of licorice before the peat kicks in and stays. It’s a bit like seeing a talented teenager try out for a sports team: lots of talent no obvious weaknesses but not yet big enough to front up to the first team and in need of some muscle. Nevertheless surprisingly balanced and rounded and a sign of good things to come. (Selected British whisky outlets.)"
3483,1,"England’s sole whisky distillery (currently at any rate; anything could and probably will happen) is located in Norfolk where farmer Andrew Nelstrop started distilling in November 2006. Small batches have been released in ‘Chapters’ giving whisky lovers teasing glimpses of how the spirit is maturing. Light and delicate — there’s also a peated variant — Nelstrop reckons it will hit its peak in its early teens. I see no reason to dispute him. This chapter is picking up a straw color and has a nose that’s reminiscent of fresh barley while a little citrus hangs around at the back. Young — think green apple and green grass with milled flour on the tongue — it’s a whistle-clean whisky. £38"
3484,10,"The nose is lavish with dried orange peel raisins plum gingersnaps aniseed and menthol. It’s a thick malty statement whisky rich with raisin prune juice heather honey fig and walnut and laced with aniseed and clove. Pleasantly reminiscent of childhood cough medicine there are long sweet syrupy prune notes at the end. It feels like it must be doing you some good. (3000 bottles)"
3485,10,"Peeling back the wrapper on a British chocolate bar studded with whole almonds only to find an unexpected puff of spices; green cardamom pod and toasted fenugreek. Intriguing never pungent. Given the spectrum of flavors in Madeira this finish pushes the richness and complexity of the wine; raisin coffee and dried fruits make it sweet concentrated and mouth drawing. It relaxes to a toffee plateau with riffs on ripe date and coffee. The short coffee finish sees the chocolate return. (1882 bottles) £60"
3486,10,"Matured in 80% bourbon and 20% Pedro Ximénez casks this has Golden Delicious apples melon and banana on the nose with aromatic peat smoke drawing weighty spices in their wake. It’s a beautifully honeyed dram supported by melon golden sultana and a touch of lime. The crest of clove black pepper and sooty smoke is kept at bay by that golden sweetness ahead of a tingling spicy finish. €55"
3487,10,"A Moscatel finish for a year after maturation in bourbon casks has added dark sweet notes to the whisky’s natural character. This has an attractive nose of red-skinned apples sweet dark raisins coconut nutmeg cinnamon and clove. The creamy texture has well-balanced flavors of tangy tropical fruit Szechuan peppercorns and a dalliance with citrus. Light clean and refreshing through to the finish of spiced apple and pepper. Subtle and careful this is a restrained example of extra maturation. (2554 bottles) £60"
3488,10,"Bourbon and sherry cask maturation were used for this bottling which marks a milestone for the Finnish distillers. This has a nose of fresh cut apple scrunched orange peel malt lime zest and digestive biscuits drizzled with sesame oil. Lemon sherbet cremola foam and custard Danish start in a sweet direction though it speedily converges prismatically to a trio of flavors comprising spearmint gum menthol and clove. Water only enhances the menthol. A cool minty finish with residual sweet juices."
3489,12,"France has quietly been making some exciting whiskies and keeping most to itself. Fortunately Warenghem Distillery in Brittany exports a number of single malts which it has been making for over two decades. This whisky matured initially in local oak and finished in first-fill sherry casks has perfumy aromas that lift up its malt-forward character. Spicy and floral with flavors of citrus cherry raspberry-jam cookie salted nuts and savory tobacco it is delicate with a satisfying creamy texture. This is a reformulation of the previously available Double Maturation utilizing new cask techniques advised by the late Dr. Jim Swan. Number 6 in the 2018 Top 20"
3490,10,"Every May Jean Donnay searches for an exceptional single cask to bottle in honor of the patron saint of Brittany. This fresh bourbon barrel was an inspired pick. Summer honey creamed coconut honeysuckle blossom vanilla panna cotta and an attractive turf-rich peat note leap from the glass. Tart and juicy with tangerine imbued with peat its journey takes on a delicious malty and chocolate character arriving at a delectable final plateau of nutmeg. He’s found superb balance this year. €95"
3491,10,"What happened when Warenghem Distillery’s David Roussier finished some of his famous Breton whisky for 2 years in a Dartigalongue Armagnac cask from the oldest Bas Armagnac production house? Sweet apple pear vanilla lemon peel and marzipan appear. A drink that awakens intense citrus sensations of marmalade mixed peel lemon and orange segments followed by a light snap of pepper gooseberries nectarine flesh and a lemony finish with hints of oak."
3492,10,"Green herb notes vanilla green melon Quaker oats toasted cumin and cardamom. This is a light golden whisky replete with vanilla and raspberry notes. Ripe and dried red fruits are balanced with clove and pepper. A good all-rounder with a finish of active spices vanilla pod and a few oak char notes. Warenghem Distillery will release this whisky in limited quantities annually until it’s permanently available. (2000 bottles; 60 for U.S.)"
3493,10,"The Daucourt family from Angoulême in the Cognac region produces their single malt using French spring barley. It is aged in a variety of casks: Limousin oak cherrywood and acacia. The signature tangerine note is there along with vanilla fudge and sweet spiced dried apricots. Warming preserved-orange notes and honey make for a buttery smooth dram with a growing spiciness as you would expect from the French oak. A tongue-tingling spicy finish. Vive la révolution!"
3494,10,"Brenne has a fruity vinous demeanor unlike anything else on the whisky market and this year’s bottling deploys a greater use of Cognac barrels. Ripe honeydew melon poached pear strands of lemon and mandarin and warm creamed rice pudding. Mandarin segments in watermelon juice liberally sprinkled with pepper then some fudge-like sweetness emerges barbed with fennel. The French oak spices persist into the finish heaping on the pepper and licorice."
3495,10,"Brenne’s first age statement whisky this was matured in virgin French Limousin oak and cognac barrels. It’s a fruit salad of nectarine white grape juice watermelon and pear with touches of light vanilla and black tea. A cool clean sip delivers apple pear peach and apricot followed by an intense wave of citrus Fruit Pastilles spice and orange butter icing. Those spices fade slowly; the residual flavors are fruity rather than sweet. Clear evidence that Brenne is improving all the time."
3496,10,"A noble French single malt whisky from the Cognac region pronounced ‘Veecont’ (Viscount). The barley is 100% organic and the whisky makes the best use of French Limousin oak cognac barrel maturation for 8 years with luscious results. The nose resounds with poached pear overripe apricot peach cordial orange peel toasted spices crème brûlée and fruit syrups. A satin smooth drinking experience shows sweet burnt sugars fruit cordials and roasted lime slices. The finish is a ripe harvest of apricots. £36"
3497,10,"Lemon lozenges and chewy warm cookies with muscular brutish smoke characteristics; like standing too close to the open doors of a peat kiln. The palate begins with gooseberries; very sharp sour and acidic the blistering alcohol rolling through like a steamroller while ginger and pepper fly about like sparks off a grindstone. It is enjoyably mollified through dilution to suggest sponge cake citrus chocolate and tobacco notes. The consummate Kornog can be divine but this is hard core. €100"
3498,9,"What impresses me most is how this whisky evolves; it's incredibly complex. On the nose and palate this is a thick viscous whisky with notes of sticky toffee earthy oak fig cake roasted nuts fallen fruit pancake batter black cherry ripe peach dark chocolate-covered espresso bean polished leather tobacco a hint of wild game and lingering leafy damp kiln smoke. Flavors continue on the palate long after swallowing. This is what we all hope for (and dream of) in an older whisky!"
3499,1,"There have been some legendary Bowmores from the mid-60s and this is every bit their equal. All of them share a remarkable aroma of tropical fruit which here moves into hallucinatory intensity: guava mango peach pineapple grapefruit. There’s a very light touch of peat smoke more a memory of Islay than the reality. Concentrated; even at low strength the palate is silky heady and haunting and lasts forever in the dry glass. A legend is born. (Eight bottles only for the U.S.) Editor's Choice."
3500,9,"It’s great that Glenlivet releases whiskies under the 'Cellar Collection' label. It really shows the true potential of Glenlivet. This bottling is classic ultra-matured Glenlivet and rivals the 1959 vintage Cellar Collection as the best one ever. An incredibly complex whisky with notes of vanilla ripe barley coconut and caramel. All this is accentuated by glazed orange hazelnut and a potpourri of dried spices. Not the least bit tired for such an aged whisky. (Only 800 bottles for the U.S.)"
3501,1,"A rich amber color and elegantly oxidized notes greet you. There are luscious old fruits—pineapple dried peach apricot—and puffs of coal-like smokiness. In time sweet spices (cumin especially) emerge. Superbly balanced. The palate while fragile still has real sweetness alongside a lick of treacle. It can take a drop of water allowing richer darker fruits to emerge. The finish is powerful long and resonant. Superb not over-wooded and a fair price for such a rarity. £1995"
3502,9,"Classic sherry cask-aged Macallan. Antique amber with hints of ruby. Thickly textured complex and quite deep with notes of toffee ripe pit fruit raisin apple pie dried spice (cinnamon clove ginger and mint) and a wisp of smoke. An exceptional multi-faceted Macallan!"
3503,9,"The Dalmore is one of a handful of whiskies that seem to be able to age in the cask for many decades and still improve. This one is incredibly viscous on the nose and palate (and very heavy on the tongue) with chewy toffee and old pot still rum. The classic Dalmore marmalade note shines throughout along with vanilla cream an array of dried spices (especially cinnamon and evergreen) juicy oak forest bedding rancio old armagnac polished leather tobacco maple syrup dark chocolate almond macaroon and subtle espresso. Long mouth-coating finish. The flavors evolve like waves lapping on the palate -- especially the interplay with the oak. I can’t drink this whisky slowly enough. A rare experience for the lucky few who can afford it. (Price is per 100ml.)"
3504,9,"Deep gold color. Surprisingly lively on the nose for its age. A complex array of fruit (tangerine sultana pink grapefruit papaya and the general overall citrus DNA that you’ll find in old Bowmores) with balancing notes of honey and vanilla. A hint of damp smoke and coconut. Just like with Black Bowmore this is a texturally soothing whisky on the palate which continues to evolve in waves -- first the sweet honey coating vanilla and lively fruit then turning quite visceral with juicy oak damp earth deep peat smoke and charcoal followed by another wave of fruit (this time dried fruit) finishing off with subtle charred oak and roasted nuts. This whisky is better than White Bowmore and it falls just short of Black Bowmore (which I rated 97) because it’s just a bit softer and less vibrant on the palate."
3505,9,"Definitely showing its age but not in a bad way — the distillery character is still there. Solid foundation of thick chewy toffee old pot still rum and fig cake. Fruity too with notes of golden raisin and nectarine. Soft seductive peat smoke juicy oak cinnamon and brine round out the palate. Excellent balance! One of the finest Bowmore whiskies I’ve ever tasted (and at this price will probably never taste again.) (Editor's Pick)"
3506,12,"Smoky peat weaves seamlessly through aromas of vanilla sugar candied citrus ripe papaya cocoa powder and ocean spray; with water the intensity of vanilla surges balancing with the peat. Flavors of saltwater taffy vanilla mint and pepper are swept up by savory peat before darker notes of coffee bean cocoa powder and roasted nuts take over. The tide ebbs gently on the finish leaving only impressions in the sand that stay long after the final sip. (1440 bottles for U.S.) (Editors' Choice)"
3507,6,"The early nose offers hand-rolled tobacco ginger black pepper and fragrant woodsmoke. Medicinal notes brine and lemon develop in time. Sweet peat smoke tropical fruits toffee and aniseed on the palate with smoked haddock and a suggestion of tar. Iodine black pepper and sea salt in the lengthy finish."
3508,9,"Quite fresh and appetizing for a 35 year old whisky but not too surprising for a Springbank. Notes of creamy vanilla burnt caramel coconut custard brine and a hint of anise. Complex vibrant and well-balanced. Reminds me why I love those old Springers. Devotees will not be disappointed. A stunning whisky! (Exclusive to Astor Wines and Spirits.)"
3509,6,"The nose of this veteran is hugely enticing; rich with old leather soft spices sultanas figs polished oak and dunnage warehouses. Tangy orange develops in time. The orange carries over onto the palate—amazingly vibrant and youthful fruitiness—followed by soft toffee woodsmoke and a sprinkling of dusty oak. The finish is extraordinarily long with licorice and fruit-laden old oak. A true classic! (77 bottles in U.S.)"
3510,9,"This whisky has all the positive aspects of a very mature whisky (depth complexity) without all the negative ones (excessive oak one-dimensional). Very clean but oily in texture with honeyed vanilla caramel citrus (tangerine orange lemon) nectarine olive brine black pepper ginger cut grass mustard seed and just the hint of teasing smoke. Briny spicy finish. Wonderful!"
3511,9,"Astonishingly fresh and clean for 30 years in oak and with incredible depth. Slight oily texture. Appetizing brine with honeyed vanilla mustard seed green olive Seville orange and lemon zest. Underlying smoke damp peat and seaweed. Put simply Brora at its finest."
3512,9,"A marriage of three casks one of them an ex-sherry butt. The sherry is certainly evident and this is more sherried than many of the Cellar Collection whiskies to date. Opulent and seductive with prominent fruit (glazed spiced oranges ripe peach and hints of pineapple and coconut) caramel-coated nuts and vanilla custard. A peppering of ginger and cinnamon throughout. Coating soothing finish. Polished and seamless with no trace of excessive oak. One of the richest -- and finest -- Cellar Collections to date. Anyone willing and able to cough up the bucks for this whisky will be richly rewarded. (Only 240 bottles available in the U.S. beginning June 2010.)"
3513,9,"It has been quite a while since we’ve seen a new Glenfarclas here in the U.S. but after tasting this whisky it was worth the wait. Glenfarclas is a rich stylish whisky that ages very well and this 1968 vintage proves it. It is very deep and mature with complex fruit (sultana marmalade) layered by sweetness (honey caramel and toffee). All those years in oak contribute another dimension to the whisky providing a dry oaky spiciness polished leather and a hint of tobacco-especially on the finish. Never does the whisky taste tired or excessively woody. It expresses all that is good about an older whisky without any of the down side. I’m told that most of the 1400 bottles imported to the U.S. went to the Chicago area. It’s worth taking the extra time to track down a bottle."
3514,9,"Glenfarclas has a proven track record for aging very well. I’ve enjoyed some amazing 25 and 30 year old expressions in addition to some older vintage offerings. Does this new 40 year old follow suit? Absolutely! It’s complex and well-rounded with great depth and no excessive oak. Lush candied citrus (especially orange) old pot still rum maple syrup fig roasted nuts and polished leather with hints of mocha candied ginger and tobacco. A bit oily in texture (which I find soothing) with good tannic grip on the finish. A classic well-matured Glenfarclas — and a very good value for its age. (Editor's Choice)"
3515,6,"Part of the permanent Ardbeg range since 2008 Corryvreckan is created from a blend of standard Ardbeg and Ardbeg aged in virgin French Limousin oak casks. Smoky bacon and seaweed plus dark berries prickly spices walnuts lemon and sweet peat on the nose. Sweet and savory on the palate with more lively spice woodsmoke phenols and licorice. The finish is lengthy with peat sea salt pepper and black coffee. Editors’ Choice"
3516,12,"Briny smoke integrates with sweet bakery aromas: vanilla streusel ginger-spiced pound cake cinnamon and allspice studded with nuts and dried apple. With water butterscotch oozes out. The palate’s silky texture is an ideal base for warm vanilla toasted nuts toffee and milk chocolate swirling with iodine peat and gentle gingerbread spices. The finish is complex compelling and quite lengthy with ginger white pepper allspice saline coffee grounds dried apple and lingering smoke. (Collectible)"
3517,2,"Benriach digs into the vaults for this rare gem and it’s a tour de force. The maturity shows at once with an antique note of well-aged peat char and dark sherried aromas of dried figs and raisins. The palate offers flavors of cooked berries and baked apple along with candle wax dark chocolate and roasted espresso beans. It all finishes with rich chocolate old spice rack and a parting note of ashy peat. A complete whisky."
3518,9,"Dark and decadent. Notes of old pot still rum roasted nuts chocolate fudge burnished leather Dundee cake tobacco and a hint of damp peat. When I drink this I feel like I’m sitting in the study of a stately Scottish mansion contemplating a fine aged Cuban cigar. Royalty in a glass. (Bottled for Binny’s Beverage Depot)"
3519,9,"Cask #3145 is the lighter in color and the sweet notes that balance the smoke and seaweed are not as deeply caramelized as Cask #3542. I’m tasting hints of shortbread and caramel which show through the peat smoke tobacco toasted nuts firm spice notes (cinnamon clove and mint) and lingering brine. Very complex. Price listed includes the entire Double Barrel 1974 Vintage set."
3520,9,"Amber color. Richly textured (great mouth feel) with vanilla fudge nougat ripe citrus and ginger cake leading to a complex spicy finish. Great depth on this one. Well-polished. My pick of the lot."
3923,6,"This expression is aged for approximately 5 years in bourbon barrels before spending a final few months in quarter casks. Characteristic tar engine oil and ashy peat on the nose. Oily and full on the palate with sweet grain notes cinnamon seaweed hot peat and black pepper. The finish is long and powerful with persistent peat and chili plus a sprinkling of sea salt."
3521,9,"The flavors evolve on the nose and palate with peat kiln smoke fresh asphalt damp earth warehouses morning-after campfire ash and old boat dock contrasting nicely with toffee apple crème caramel delicate raspberry preserve and dried citrus. Long smoky spicy briny seaweed dirty martini-tinged finish. This whisky comes from a combination of both sherry and bourbon casks and the marriage works. I also like that it retains some of its youthful brashness while showing the depth that maturity affords a whisky. A delicious well-balanced old-fashioned Laphroaig.(Reviewing this whisky gave me an excuse to open a “fresh” bottle of its predecessor the 30 year old and here are my thoughts. The 30 year old is softer mellower drier and more debonair. The 25 year old is bolder more youthful more dynamic richer and sweeter — bottling at cask strength really helps here. Both whiskies are very nice but quite different in personality.)"
3522,9,"Bottled in 2004 but just recently put in circulation here in the U.S. (Very strange.) It’s worth the wait. It’s fresh (even at 22 years old) appetizing spicy and briny. There’s a sweet foundation of vanilla wafer and caramel with a slightly oily texture. White pepper seaweed mustard seed lime gherkin and teasing gin botanicals add complexity. Spicy salty finish. A vibrant dynamic expression of the shuttered original Clynelish distillery. Quite stunning actually. Find yourself a bottle before they’re gone!"
3523,6,"Ardbeg’s first core bottling with an age statement in nearly 20 years was matured in bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. Rock pools fabric Band-Aids coal dust licorice hot peat pineapple and a seafood platter on the complex nose. The palate is oily with smoked fish overt peat smoke chili iodine and lemon. Long in the finish with more iodine and peppery peat. A delightfully traditional Ardbeg."
3524,9,"An excellent example of an ultra-mature sherried whisky done the right way. Much darker and more decadent than the other two releases here. Silky texture. Rummy jammy fruit toasted walnut leather spice (cinnamon clove) tobacco and dark chocolate with a foundation of juicy oak. Tasting this whisky you know it’s old but you also know it’s very good."
3525,1,"The whisky is sensational a glorious mix of ginseng syrup baked banana semi-dried tropical fruits and an exotic smoked edge. Without the last you could believe it was a delicate Cognac. In time there’s peppermint and guava syrup. A sip is all you need to reveal perfect thrilling harmony: light nuttiness pollen subtle fruits gentle smoke and light fungal touches. It’s stunning but it’s £16000! Whisky this great even in limited quantities should be fairly priced. Points off. £16000"
3526,6,"Maturation of this 1978 distillate has taken place in European oak and refill American oak casks. Fresh and fruity on the early herbal nose; a hint of wax plus brine developing walnut fudge and an underlying wisp of smoke. Finally wood resin. The palate is very fruity with mixed spices then plain chocolate damp undergrowth gentle peat smoke and finally coal. Mildly medicinal. Ashy peat and aniseed linger in the long slowly drying finish. Brora at its very best. (2944 bottles) Editor's Choice"
3527,1,"Though Brora has acquired cult status it has to be said that for a few years these Special Release Broras went through an off-putting butyric phase which might well have put off newbies to this legendary closed site who must have wondered what all the fuss was about.
One nose of the 2010 SR shows that these days have been consigned to the past. This is classy from the word go. Gold in color; the nose manages to be both overtly waxy — I’m reminded of waxed paper — and fragrant. Behind that is coal smoke rather than the heavy peatiness of earlier vintages (Brora’s peating levels varied in its last years). In other words this is robust and powerful with an evocative aroma that speaks of old sea chests the seashore and vellum. Hugely concentrated with massed fruits — quince especially — following behind. This is amplified with a drop or two of water. 
The palate is unctuous and heavy. Tectonic plates move more quickly than this does in the mouth. When it does the oily/waxy textures and flavors move slowly — camphor peach membrillo hints of citrus and toward the finish a growing brininess (akin to olives) and a hint of smoke. Elemental and one of the best Broras for years. [not available in the U.S.]£280"
3528,9,"Bottled in 2001 but still in circulation and (fortunately) just finding its way to me. These Springers from the ‘60s are getting rarer and quite expensive. This is a great example of why they are so coveted -- clean and well matured with no sign of excessive oak. Elegant sherried fruit dovetails nicely with polished oak and a steady stream of dried spices. Look for citrus nectarine red licorice coconut oil ripe banana and vanilla custard with warming cinnamon and brine. Warm spicy finish. Very polished!"
3529,9,"Bottled to celebrate the 125th Anniversary of the distillery. Classic Bunnahabhain-toffeed and quite nutty. Almost rummy in nature with rich molasses notes throughout and layers of sweetness. Some salt emerges on occasion as do notes of honey coconut and candied fruit with a pleasingly dry gently spicy finish to round everything out. Surprisingly youthful for its age nicely balanced and very drinkable. A great Bunnahabhain!"
3530,6,"Introduced to the Highland Park portfolio in 1997. Gentle peat soft toffee floral notes and honey on the beautifully fragrant nose. Superbly balanced on the velvety palate with brittle toffee stewed fruits peat honey and a hint of coffee. Smoke and more toffee mingle in the long elegant finish."
3531,6,"The third and most exclusive release in Bowmore’s Vault Legends Collection was matured for 50 years in bourbon hogshead #5675. The nose is fragrant and musky slightly oily with orange peel developing vanilla and green citrus notes. Intense orange and peach on the palate with black pepper aniseed and sweet oak. Very persistent tangy citrus fruits through the extremely long finish. No negative tannic notes. (74 bottles)"
3532,12,"The nose leans sweet with dulce de leche and dark berry jam but it’s countered with dark chocolate dried rose petals and a faint whiff of talc. The palate is thick with raisins figs candied ginger orange peel Concord grape jelly rose oil cocoa and peppery spice while the lengthy finish has persistent white pepper dried ginger chocolate and burnt citrus. Dense with flavor thanks to its total sherry-cask maturation; give it time to fully reveal its depths."
3533,6,"Previous Broras in the Diageo Special Release series have set the bar remarkably high and this the eleventh such bottling does not disappoint. The component whiskies were distilled during 1976 and 1977 and matured in refill American oak casks. The nose offers lemon and contrasting vanilla and honeycomb aromas. Musty malt and coal in the background. The citrus and honey themes continue into the slightly earthy peppery palate while French mustard and coal figure in the drying finish. 1566 bottles."
3534,6,"This is the 15th Special Releases bottling of Lagavulin 12 year old. Matured in refill American oak hogsheads. The nose is smoky with kippers charcuterie and bonfire embers offset by berry fruits. On the unctuous palate smoke blends with vanilla green apples and licorice plus pepper and sea salt. Peppery ashy peat in the lengthy finish. (Individual reviewer rating: 91)"
3535,12,"Delicately aromatic and tropical on the nose with piña colada pistachio pudding almond halva coconut and apple blossom. The palate is elegant and pretty nuanced with pistachio almond vanilla malted milkshake coconut and pineapple before sweeping oak and tobacco roll into a gorgeous tropical fruit and toasted coconut finish. A masterwork in balancing spirit character with finishing cask."
3536,6,"The first bottling of Astar was released in 2008. The 2017 release was matured in casks made of oak from Missouri’s Ozark Mountains. The nose is floral with rosehips orange blossom and milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight. Honey and citrus notes follow. Voluptuous on the palate; sweet even sugary fresh fruit notes plus vanilla cinnamon and cloves. Drying from coconut to plain chocolate in the lengthy finish. Extremely accomplished. (Individual reviewer rating: 93)"
3537,9,"For the past several years the Stillman’s Dram expression of The Dalmore has been a 30 year old. This new 28 year old expression besides being two years younger is also slightly less sherried. In this instance I feel that both have enhanced the whisky. Trimming back on the sherry and oak allows the whisky’s trademark orange marmalade complex spice and briny freshness to shine through. This one is lively dynamic evolving well-balanced and always entertaining. The best Dalmore Stillman’s Dram in years."
3538,2,"Loaded with briny peat and barbecued bacon up front before fresh undernotes of peach lemon spritz and ginger begin to emerge. On the palate bonfire embers are followed by orchard fruits raspberry jam and grapefruit with subdued flavors of vanilla lacings of chile pepper and smoldering peat. Water brings out more—lemon cream pie chocolate galia melon and cooked pears. True to the Islay character in its assertiveness yet also delicate and subtle. (720 bottles)"
3539,12,"Sherry lovers alight here: This stop is full of Fig Newtons dates raisins brown sugar candied citrus dark chocolate and a delightful dried mango aroma. Generous flavors of berry jam raisins figs and dates mingle with white pepper dried ginger candied orange peel nuts and dark chocolate tinged with leather and tobacco along with a mouthwatering salinity. The finish has a phantom chewiness: There’s nothing left in the mouth but it’s still textured and rich with smoked nuts cigar wrapper and raisins."
3540,2,"Dark and rich in both color and aroma with a deep sherried nose of blackberry cobbler grape jelly raisins dried figs baked brown sugar light rancio and milk chocolate. Tear yourself away from that captivating nose because it gets even better—a palate of jammy dark fruit cigar ash bitter chocolate and roasted espresso beans as well as notes of cigar ash candle wax and light smoke all pouring it on at the finish. (633 bottles)"
3541,9,"A marriage of two casks (refill hogsheads). Significantly darker in color than the 1968 vintage. Darker (and more serious) in personality too. Red berries (strawberry raspberry) rhubarb plum oak sap vanilla bean smoldering peat coffee grounds toasted almond and dusty malt. The finish is long and contemplative with notes of polished leather juicy oak and telicherry peppercorns. £3750"
3542,2,"A mature but still fragrant nose offers mint dried leaves antique leather red berry tea cherries and milk chocolate. A deliciously gooey sherried palate is packed with notes of cooked strawberries dark berry jam chocolate layer cake and cinnamon spice balanced by earthy tones of the warehouse. A smooth rich finish offers more deep red-fruit jam rancio and aged cigar wrapper. Layer upon layer of flavors to enjoy in this elegantly aged beauty. (638 bottles)"
3543,6,"This veteran was matured in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. The nose is fragrant with malt raisins and tangy orange in time settling to stewed fruits; a pleasing harmony of aromas. The palate is chewy and spicy with a lovely bitter-sweet interplay between orchard fruits and dark oak sprinkled with icing sugar. Licorice tannic oak and bitter chocolate in the very long finish. A classic survivor. £21000"
3544,9,"Aged in sherry butts which is a departure from some of the older Glengoyne vintage samples I have which show more bourbon barrel characteristics. It is a very fruity spicy textural dram with spiced apple red raspberry strawberry plum golden raisin fried plantain and creme brulee. Good grip on the finish with grape stems and warming spice (cinnamon cracked peppercorn and clove). I love the balance on this whisky. It has aged very gracefully. (Limited to 250 bottles worldwide.)"
3545,12,"Exhibit A for never judging a whisky by its color: This straw-pale malt shows depth and complexity many sherry-dark whiskies would envy. The nose is briny and smoky with a seaweed character; lemon poppyseed muffin and almond cake are present without water. Add a few drops however and fresh orchard fruit emerges sweet and clean and carries into the rounded silky palate where it mingles with salt water black pepper a squeeze of lemon and smoky peat. Good length on the finish which has oak nuts and cigar wrapper. A paragon of balance. (240 bottles)"
3546,12,"Thick with sherry fruit on the nose: cooked dark berries raisins and dried figs though the fruit becomes more jammy when water is added. There’s also dark chocolate hazelnuts and leather. The palate is equally thick and chewy offering figs raisins dark chocolate coffee bean and raspberry cake filling as well as green apple and guava candy showing this whisky’s maturity. It finishes with coffee chocolate dark berries white pepper orange pith and oak that verges on bitterness but never tips over the edge. Stately and dignified. (405 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3547,12,"Powerfully tropical on the nose with guava jackfruit mango and papaya in spades; hibiscus blueberry-pomegranate juice almond and a hint of caramel drizzle as well. The palate delivers on that aromatic promise bursting with guava and papaya as well as mouth-puckering citrus and almond pastry. The lengthy finish is still fruity but leans into dryness with almond and clean cereal notes and at the last a wisp of cigar. Don’t be afraid to add water if you wish to reduce the alcohol; the intense flavors remain. (251 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3548,9,"Matured entirely in oloroso sherry butts this whisky is chock-full of lush fruit roasted nuts deep spice notes and a hint of damp smoke. It is wonderfully integrated with incredible depth and maturity without being tired-and it expresses a soothing quality that doesn’t quit. It is stunning throughout and more polished and rounded than the 1968 Vintage released a while back which while enjoyable was a tad sappy and a bit too oaky at times. This whisky is easily one of the 10 best new whiskies for 2005 and worth every penny. Get a bottle while you can."
3549,6,"An innovative offering made with a proportion of chocolate malt and matured in virgin American oak. Some of the component whiskies are between 35 and 40 years old. Milk chocolate honey orange marmalade sultanas and spice on the inviting nose. The palate is rich and full with malt dates Jaffa oranges dark chocolate and coffee beans. Long and spicy in the drying finish. Glenmorangie at its very best."
3550,6,"Just 160 bottles of 1972 Brora are available through UK World of Whiskies and World Duty Free Group stores. The oldest bottling of Brora to date was distilled using heavily-peated malt. A big hit of oily peat on the early nose with malt dried fruit and black pepper. Mildly medicinal. The palate yields bonfire ash licorice honey more pepper and well-integrated oak. The finish is long with peat smoke plain chocolate and tannins lingering in harmony. Complex and rewarding. £7000"
3551,4,"This is the first time I’ve been up for reviews here so I had a game plan: play it cool mark tightly let everyone know I’m hard to please. Then they gave me this the whisky equivalent to front row tickets to Neil Young on his current Twisted Road tour: not just a chance to get up close and personal with an old favorite but to do so with an old favorite who’s on fire. Laphroaig’s owners are intent on ensuring a big peaty engine for any new release but this is a monster by anyone’s standards. It’s essentially Quarter Cask finished in oloroso sherry casks so in addition to the intense charcoal smoke attack there are rich fruity notes; blackcurrant and berries. It’s an evening barbecue whisky. Grill that fish until it’s blackened and crispy drizzle on lemon and as the smoke rears up in protest sip this. Big moody broody fruity and rich: what’s not to love? (Travel Retail and some European specialist retailers)"
3552,6,"This 18 year old is aged in a mix of bourbon barrels and oloroso sherry casks. The nose is redolent of a damped-down bonfire with stewed fruit wood spice and pipe tobacco. There are red berries subtle peat a hint of iodine and soft oak on the complex palate. The finish yields more tobacco oak rich peat and spicy dark chocolate."
3553,9,"I like this Bowmore better than all the previous bourbon oak-aged ultra-mature Bowmore whiskies that have been released over the past fifteen years (there have been several). The oak is always present but not dominant. The whisky really evolves on the palate just like the Black Bowmore releases. This emphasis here is on fruit bright fruit: peach tangerine mango ripe melon and pineapple. There’s a soft gentle side to the whisky too enhanced by sweeter notes of pancake syrup orange creamsicle and white chocolate. Heavy oak notes emerge along with teasing earthy smoke to give the whisky depth and bottom notes. The smoke and oak linger long on the finish. Very contemplative. In short an outstanding whisky but not quite reaching the excellence of Black Bowmore. 
   (Allocation information: 732 bottles available worldwide; 40 bottles are being allocated for the U.S. half of the quantity of Black Bowmore which was released earlier this year.)"
3554,6,"Conventional wisdom suggests that Lagavulin is at its peak at 16 years of age. However this superlative 12 year old confirms why many consumers like their Lagavulin younger. This is Lagavulin at its very best: bold yet complex and satisfying; full of character with smoky savory maritime sweet vanilla and fruit notes all merging into a balanced and eminently drinkable whole. It takes a few drops of water well releasing burnt grass aromas and more palate sweetness. The Diageo Special Releases are not known to be bargains but this Lagavulin is sensibly priced and the greatest all-around value from the 2017 lineup. Number 4 in the 2017 Top 20"
3555,6,"This is the 13th annual release of Brora which has been aged in refill American oak and refill European oak casks. Hessian and hemp on the early nose with a whiff of ozone discreet peat and old tar. Fragrant and fruity notes develop with ripe apples and a hint of honey. The palate is waxy sweet and spicy with heather and ginger. Mildly medicinal and smoky. Dries steadily in the finish to aniseed black pepper dark chocolate and fruity tannins. (2964 bottles)"
3556,6,"Launched in 2003 Uigeadail remains one of Ardbeg’s core offerings. Matured in a mix of sherry and bourbon barrels and bottled at cask strength. Peppery peat warm tar coffee grounds machine oil and black pepper on the nose. The palate is complex and rich offering orange segments sprinkled with sea salt dark chocolate malt and ever-present sweet peat. Nicely balanced. Lengthy in the finish with smoky caramel."
3557,6,"Glenmorangie Astar returns after a five-year absence. Astar is matured in custom toasted casks made from slow-growing trees on north-facing slopes in the Ozark Mountains of Missouri. The barrels harbor bourbon for four years before heading to Glenmorangie. That level of provenance doesn’t come cheap which is why the original Astar was discontinued in 2012 just four years after its acclaimed appearance. The exquisite Glenmorangie aromas and flavors—floral with rose hips and orange blossom—are dialed up to new levels of intensity while the voluptuous and sweet palate exudes harmony and balance. Number 2 in the 2017 Top 20"
3558,12,"Subtlety sets the tone on this well-matured whisky starting with the gentle smokiness of the nose presenting as smoked almonds and crème brûlée along with snickerdoodles honey marmalade dried apricots milk chocolate and brown sugar. Water brings out black licorice dried ginger and hazelnut cream. Oily citrus dried apricot and fig milk chocolate and candied ginger on the palate with drying smoke and char. It finishes with cocoa powder char and well-woven spice and dried fruit."
3559,9,"Rummy molasses and toffee sweetness intertwine with roasted nuts and bright juicy fruit. Suggestions of fig lavender leather and tobacco throughout with a hint of peat and polished oak on the finish. Not quite as refined as the Highland Park 18 year old but it makes up for this with its dynamic personality. A delicious ultra-mature sherry cask-aged whisky. (A Binny’s Beverage Depot exclusive.)"
3560,9,"This limited edition bottling consists of a marriage of both European and American oak. Still lively for its age and beautifully balanced. Bountiful golden fruit (sultana pineapple upside down cake tangerine overripe nectarine) balanced by soothing creamy vanilla. A peppering of dried spice chamomile tea toasted oak cigar box and subtle smoke round out the palate. Soft and seductive. (Not available in the U.S.) £2250"
3561,9,"A delicious well-balanced ultra-matured expression of Highland Park. Toffee apples molasses and vanilla fudge provide a sweet foundation with evolving notes of dark chocolate dry spicy oak tobacco subtle smoke and lingering brine on the finish. Nicely done. (Bottled for Old Oaks Cigar & Wine Company)"
3562,9,"An essay in elegance. Silky and soft in texture and very clean. Notes of peaches and cream vanilla wafer soft honey and fruit gum drops. Subtler notes of tropical fruit (pineapple lemon coconut) demerara sugar heather and anise. Polished oak adds structure and contrast with a very elegant finish. Hard to believe this whisky is 32 years old. It's lighter and more elegant than the equally splendid Highland Park 30 year old which I rated a 94 in the last issue. (Bottled exclusively for Park Avenue Liquors.)"
3577,9,"Antique amber. The darkest and most decadent of the four. Quite viscous and soothing with well-layered notes of apple pie marmalade and maple syrup balanced by dried fruits ginger polished leather tobacco and resinous oak. One to sip and savor very slowly. (This whisky is much better than the last ultra-premium release the Macallan 55 year old in the Lalique Decanter and thousands of dollars less.)"
3563,9,"An exemplary Highland Park. There's certainly plenty of sherry influence in this whisky and it is complementary. (About 2/3 of the whisky was aged on sherry casks and a lot of these casks were second fill.) The whisky enjoys a delicious foundation of toffee fruit (lemon plum blueberries) and dark chocolate. It continues to develop and evolve on the palate with emerging notes of heather nougat lavender delicate peat and complex dried spice (especially cinnamon and nutmeg) to balance the sweeter notes. The extra alcohol is also a bonus providing a drying balance to the whisky's sweetness. Whiskies like this one remind me why I fell in love with whisky in the first place."
3564,9,"Very spicy and complex with incredible depth. Once again this 30-plus year old whisky proves the aging ability of Balvenie. Still quite vibrant and invigorating for such maturity. The classic Balvenie honey note is there but more reserved along with graham cracker vanilla wafer citrus peel raspberry (red and black) nectarine and polished oak. Long spicy finish. Another outstanding Balvenie Vintage Cask. Although I look at the price and remember how shocked I was when the Balvenie vintages were selling for $400."
3565,7,"From the nose you can tell this is a special whisky with old dark lacquered wood dusty cigar box and sea salt combined with dark sweet cherry and a hint of rancio. On the palate it gets even better with lush dark cherry perfectly balanced and integrated with oak spice salt and peat smoke. There’s clear rancio in the center of it all that's utterly delicious. This stunner finishes with a long slightly spicy and entirely lovely finish. (Park Avenue Liquor only)"
3566,9,"Cask #3524 is darker with notes of sticky toffee pudding and chewy caramel that firmly support the polished leather cigar box roasted chestnut smoked seaweed tar dark chocolate and on the finish espresso. A meditative whisky. Price listed includes entire Double Barrel 1974 Vintage set."
3567,12,"Let this whisky glide into your glass without hesitation: aromas of poached pear hazelnuts honey marmalade and ginger jam turn bright and fresh with water. The oleaginous palate is waxy in both texture and flavor slick with candied citrus and subtle spice that builds into a resonant crescendo. That spice wave meets with savory hazelnut tobacco and leathery oak on the finish lasting for minutes without slackening. (300 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3568,12,"Spirit not cask drives this whisky’s character with bright notes of lemon and lime green apple candy guava vanilla and ginger nut cookies creating an inviting and zesty nose. More lemon and lime plus tangerine on the palate along with lively spices—ginger white pepper and cinnamon—toasted almonds baking chocolate and leather. With water the profile flips as spices turn savory and chocolate and nuts take on a sweeter tone; the transformation is unexpected but lovely. Tobacco coffee bean and leathery oak on the finish. (144 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3569,8,"Benriach is a sleeper of a single malt but that’s about to change. Part of a 2020 relaunch of its core line this grabbed our attention with its sophistication breadth of flavors and lovely refinement. Much of the credit surely goes to master blender Rachel Barrie for creating a smoky whisky that both peat lovers and the peat-wary can enjoy. Rather than medicinal intensity the peat is redolent of gentle sweetly smoky fruits that integrate seamlessly with notes of vanilla toasted almond chocolate blueberry and bacon. It beckons like the wafting smoke of a warming autumn bonfire then welcomes with its lush and velvety embrace. Number 3 in the 2020 Top 20"
3570,12,"The youthful age statement may take many scotch drinkers by surprise but don’t let double-digit bias prevent you from enjoying this exciting yet easy-drinking peat bomb. Salt water and seaweed smoke and sweet peat tussle on the nose while vanilla fresh berries and ample nuttiness spread out and take hold. The structured balanced palate is creamy nutty and spiced showcasing brown-sugar bacon smoked salt milk chocolate pepper and well-integrated oak all wrapped up like a cigar with flakes of ash and sustained smoke. This precocious youngster shows more complexity than some whiskies twice its age making it a remarkable find. Number 6 in the 2020 Top 20"
3571,9,"A combination of three sherry butts and seven bourbon casks. This is a complex dynamic whisky loaded with lush layered ripe fruit (red berries tropical fruit honeyed apricot raisin) toffee oak resin polished leather and well-defined spice notes (cinnamon vanilla nutmeg clove). Long warming finish. (Exclusive to the U.S.)"
3572,6,"Single cask Aberfeldy bottlings are very few and far between and this is a stunner! After hogshead maturation the whisky ultimately underwent a period of finishing in an ex-sherry cask prior to bottling. The nose offers sultanas raisins and hot chocolate. Developing vanilla and a hint of over-ripe bananas. Finally burnt sugar and caramel. Insinuating and syrupy on the palate with apricots dried fruits honey and sherry. Gently spicy and warming with licorice in the notably long finish. £115"
3573,6,"Laphroaig’s latest batch continues the high standards set by previous releases. More sherry on the nose compared to Batch 010 with malt sea spray lemon antiseptic and big notes of peat. Citrus fruits sherry brine and peat smoke on the full palate with vanilla and charred oak. The finish is long sweet and medicinal with licorice singed over a peat fire. Editors' Choice"
3574,9,"The new ultra-mature release following its 33 year old predecessor (bottled by previous owners). It’s nice to see the higher ABV given that the 33 year old was only 40%. Very soothing. Quite deep on the nose and viscous (almost sappy) on the palate with gobs of juicy oak and old oak (its age is obvious but not imposing) dark raisin black raspberry orange marmalade roasted nuts and freshly roasted coffee beans. All of this is peppered with cinnamon ginger and charcoal. Polished leather on the finish. I like that it’s sherried and the sherry is kept in balance. Those of you who liked the 33 year old will also enjoy this one (assuming you can afford it)."
3575,12,"A deft use of bordeaux casks beautifully showcases Glen Scotia’s inherent density and amplitude. Raspberry ripple ice cream with butterscotch sauce strawberry jam tiramisu toffee and cigar wrapper on the nose. The full thick palate is sweet with raspberry and strawberry jam black currants candied ginger and orange peel tempered by dark chocolate pecan pie gingerbread spices and a touch of tobacco. It remains mouth-filling on the finish with jammy berries orange oil spices salinity and integrated oak."
3576,12,"A single Pedro Ximénez hogshead yielded this whisky which might be characterized as dramatic. Raisin fig grape skins furniture polish menthol tobacco toasted wood asphalt and medicinal iodine on the nose. Chewy robust and rich on the palate the peat keeps the cask’s sweetness in check as raisin orange marmalade dark chocolate fruit leather hefty spice roasted nuts and oak vie with iodine saline and ash. Pepper slides into oak and tobacco on the finish with dark-skinned fruit and menthol lingering. (Julio's Liquors exclusive; 288 bottles)"
3578,1,"This is the bomb. Savory and lightly meaty but sweetened by plum sauce; there’s even some strawberry around the fringes. You could see how with another 30 years this would end up like the ’54. Elegant yet powerful there’s sandalwood incense marmalade even a little dried mango. The distillery’s density is balanced by this fruit. Lush with supple tannins and at its best neat. From a refill butt this is an exemplary sherried malt. £230"
3579,12,"Sweet smoky meaty peat aromas mingle with vanilla saltwater taffy blueberry dried
ginger and bright bubble gum. The palate is consistent juxtaposing fruity
spirit—orange lemon strawberry blueberry—with savory peat smoke. Vanilla nuts
black pepper cinnamon and well-integrated oak are also at play. The finish lingers
with the sweet-savory pleasure of a cigar nutty oak spice and peat. Does well with
water showing excellent development. (208 bottles)"
3580,6,"Rich sherried fruit aromas machine oil camphor coal dust marzipan and freshly
polished oak. Full and sweet on the early palate then drying with black coffee
licorice and the distinctive flavor of coal. A long finish with dark chocolate and
cherry liqueur. No negative oakiness despite its age. Superb! Price is for entire Prima
& Ultima Collection of which this whisky is a part. (352 bottles) £20000"
3581,9,"Lush thick fruit and chewy toffee soothes the assertive notes of earthy peat and leafy bonfire. Underlying smoked nuts brine kalamata olives and tobacco provide continued entertainment. A complex whisky that completely envelops the palate. This is an excellent example of a mature sherried Bowmore."
3582,9,"Another of the Fine Oak series (aged in both bourbon and sherry casks) which will debut in the U.S. in March. Of the five Fine Oak expressions that will be in the U.S. (10 15 17 21 and 30 year old) this is my favorite slightly besting the 15 year old. Lovely sweet notes (creamy vanilla light toffee marshmallow shortbread and a kiss of honey) are accompanied by bright fruit (multi-layered citrus) and potpourri of dried spices along with a hint of nut and wisp of smoke. A very refined and sophisticated whisky."
3583,6,"The nose opens with coal-fire smoke and musty orchard fruits which freshen in time.
Peaches and mandarins a hint of brine and lit cigar. Remarkably vivid orange notes
on the palate with coal sea salt and black tea. Black pepper tar and persistent tangy
orange notes in the long finish. Price is for entire Prima & Ultima Collection of
which this whisky is a part. (436 bottles) £20000"
3584,1,"There’s precious little reticence about this beast which leaps out of the glass blowing peat smoke everywhere — then comes raffia Lapsang Souchong tea seashore wet rocks Elastoplast talcum powder bog myrtle (laurel) vetiver and the aromas of a just-expunged peat bonfire with apples baking on it. Huge and complex in other words. The palate starts with a fug of smoke being belched at you (non-peat freaks look away now) then distinct saltiness enlivens the tongue before everything plunges down; intense sweetness takes charge for a moment before it shifts into charred creosoted timbers. This begs for some water and when it’s added out comes sandalwood and peat smoke and tar and an orris root-like character — it’s not often I get gin-like notes on Lagavulin but it’s here — which rolls over you as you roll over and succumb to its power. After this year’s sublime distillery-only bottling it’s clear that Lagavulin is in a real purple patch. Superb."
3585,9,"The sixth and last bottling from the Legacy series. Legacy 6 is a marriage of six casks from 1965 1970 and 1972. Soft and mellow on the nose and palate with unbelievably restrained oak for such a mature whisky. Delicious notes of coconut soothing vanilla caramel custard and banana cream peppered with spice notes of cinnamon mint and teaberry that emerge on a soft finish that fades out gently. A fitting end to the Legacy series. I’m sad to see them go."
3586,12,"Apples pound cake treacle almond nougat and vanilla aromas set up the palate’s inherent sweetness but pay attention to the note of oyster shell minerality and wafting woodsmoke so well integrated as to be hardly noticeable—at least until you take a sip. Sweet smoke drifts over toasted almond Golden Delicious apple cinnamon and Swiss Miss hot cocoa all sprinkled with smoked salt. It finishes with grilled apple and flavored tobacco the smoke persistent but never ashy and a silky texture that’s as gentle as a caress.(Individual reviewer rating: 92)"
3587,1,"An extremely limited edition issued at last year’s Islay Jazz Fest this was chosen by warehouseman Iain McArthur as a prime example of a ‘bodega’ sherry butt (see page XX for more on the ‘bodega’ process). It is simply massive with concentrated soy/balsamic notes combining with hot embers burning rosemary fig coffee and candied peels. The smokiness is unrestrained on the tongue; all soot earth and a rolling wave of deep pimento-accented meatiness leading to a kippery finish. Magnificent. (Distillery only) £80"
3588,10,"Containing some precious closed distillery stocks this feels like the height of luxury with its aromas of clove-studded oranges cinnamon sticks rich chocolate and caramels. It’s slick and mouth-coating emitting flavors of butter toffee orange and melted chocolate with a nibble of ginger sponge Jaffa cakes and clove. It’s smooth and impeccably well mannered. (Global Travel Retail only)"
3589,1,"Bowmore lovers rarely get excited about the smokiness of their favorite single malt. Rather they obsess about the tropical fruits that some old bottlings exhibit. Here is one such example. Initially the nose suggests verjus and linseed oil but then peachiness rather than beachiness emerges. The smoke hits first on the tongue backed up with mango and violet then the tropical elements and the smoke play off each other up until a guava-laden finish."
3590,6,"Creamy on the nose with malt toasted cereal white pepper nutmeg and ultimately mulled wine. A substantial mouthfeel with honey slightly smoky red wine notes raspberry jam and fruit spice. The finish is long with spicy dark chocolate and warm spices that really linger. (Individual reviewer rating: 90)"
3591,12,"Generous and complex on all fronts: The nose is rich with marzipan sweet oranges milk chocolate pistachio ice cream and shortbread while the palate leans more toward savory flavors of toasted nuts dark chocolate leathery oak and a bit of tobacco. But it retains the rich sweetness of its namesake with marmalade figs and warming ginger and nutmeg. Like the best desserts the lengthy finish leaves one wanting more—and with so much to unpack here that’s a wonderful thing."
3592,6,"Sweet woodsmoke peat embers Jaffa oranges new leather sea salt and cigarette smoke on the nose. Orange carries over onto the robust palate with quite pronounced smokiness black pepper and dark chocolate. Long and peppery in the finish with lingering smoke and brine."
3593,10,"Sherry cask matured in its entirety this rich southern Highland beauty exudes a perfume of deep orange sweet cherry plum nutty fruitcake and pleasant oak. Beautifully balanced it showcases sweet orange red fruits baked Victoria plum and brown sugar while ginger and pepper sparkle across the tongue. Honey and stewed fruits mollify the throat. An absolute joy."
3594,6,"A triumphant expression including whisky distilled in 1990 1992 and 1993 and matured in Spanish oak sherry butts. The nose offers creamy sweet sherry figs a hint of black treacle cinnamon and ripe cherries. The full palate yields sultanas tangy citrus fruit sweet oak roasted chestnuts and ginger. Lingering bright fruit notes in the finish with raisins plain chocolate and cigar boxes. (1487 bottles)"
3595,10,"This has the poise and physique of a classic sherried Macallan. Hazelnut mixed peel peach cobbler and wood spices form a delightful olfactory combination. Warm weighty sherry notes bathe the mouth with ginger loaf milk chocolate chunks and espresso in support lilting toward a lip-smacking finish of peach melba and amontillado sherry. It’s increasingly rare to find a top-quality aged independent Macallan so don’t miss out."
3596,9,"Antique amber color. Mature complex aromas-especially in wood spice notes. In addition to wood spices I also found notes of roasted nuts coconuts orange marmalade anise and subtle brine. Thick and syrupy in texture with complex flavors that echo its aroma. The depth on the palate is incredible! Long lingering finish."
3597,9,"Antique amber color. Ripe fallen fruit aromas laced with coconut marshmallow and almonds. The sherry cask influence is very prominent on the nose but the Springbank ""brine"" character still manages to fight through. Full bodied with a soothing texture. Huge flavors with great balance and depth consisting of exotic fruits complex wood spices brine and coconut. Long lingering satisfying finish."
3598,6,"Glenmorangie Pride employs the use of Sauternes barriques to give a 10 year period of secondary maturation to a batch of spirit distilled in 1981. The result is a whisky with an intense pungent earthy nose; very complex with polished old furniture notes spices oak tannins and licorice. The palate is ‘full on’ for a Glenmorangie; waxy with sherbet honey and baked apple then orange marmalade sultana and a hint of smoke in the lengthy finish. Available July 1 2011. Price is approximate."
3599,12,"The interplay of floral and sherried notes creates an elegance that other scotches surely envy: candied rose petal dried orange peel and apricot sugared almond raisin nougat and dark chocolate on the nose then candied violet raisin date milk chocolate dried ginger candied orange peel and gingerbread on the palate. The maturity shows in tropical fruit flavors and a deep probing complexity. It finishes with chocolate coffee candied rose petal and tobacco-laced oak. Seamless."
3600,6,"The youngest of the 2020 Special Releases. Warm tar farmyard charcuterie and faint iodine on the fruity nose. Peppery stewed fruits and gentle woodsmoke on the voluptuous palate. Very prickly in the long finish with fruit-and-nut dark chocolate and chile paste. An intriguing and attractive take on Talisker."
3601,9,"Aromatically fruity and quite full with wonderful depth on the nose and palate. The fruit (golden raisins apricot red licorice papaya) is balanced by restrained honey vanilla and fennel. The whisky is always dry but never excessively so. A delicious ultra-mature whisky."
3602,6,"The oldest in the quintet of expressions in the Glenrothes Soleo Collection this was matured predominantly in first-fill sherry casks. The nose offers pineapple mango malt and nutmeg. Richly sherried on the muscular palate with caramel citrus fruits licorice and wood tannins. The finish is long and drying with sherry-soaked old oak. Glenrothes at its very best."
3603,6,"The nose yields baked apples cherry blossom marzipan then blackcurrant cordial and a hint of coal smoke. The palate features cocktail cherries sponge cake faint sherry plus prunes and raisins. The finish is very long; tannic with musty black pepper. (50 Bottles in U.S.)"
3604,9,"Port Ellen whiskies are just going to keep getting rarer and more expensive. This old-fashioned whisky is beginning to show its age but is still holding up nicely. It’s clean with no excessive oak and a soft sweet maltiness for balance. Earthy and rooty at times with tarry rope beach pebbles leafy smoke bourbon barrel char black licorice lemon peel and hints of shellfish and diesel fumes (like following a boat in the ocean). Long smoky lightly briny finish."
3605,6,"This 1979 vintage is the 17th Special Releases Port Ellen. It has been aged in refill American oak hogsheads and butts. The nose offers fresh-mown grass ripe pears and damp tweed before smoked fish and bonfire aromas emerge. The oily palate features spicy peat barbecued meat and peaches in syrup. Very long in the finish; smoky and earthy with a hint of chili and mouth-drying tannins. (2988 bottles)"
3606,6,"The tenth limited release of Grandeur was matured in a mix of Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry casks. It offers a nose of ginger raisins old leather smoky orange blackcurrants and walnuts. The palate is voluptuous with full sherry notes figs dates cinnamon and cloves. Licorice and spicy dark chocolate in the lingering finish. (240 bottles for the U.S.)"
3607,9,"Deep gold color. Fresh exciting spicy aroma of brine exotic pepper seaweed and raw fruit with interwoven notes of delicate peat and caramel. Full-bodied and muscular. Flavors are incredibly vibrant and dynamic-almost challenging-and are similar to its aroma. Salty peppery intense finish."
3608,9,"Surprisingly clean and youthful for a 30 year old both on the nose and palate. Complex too with a sea breeze freshness vanilla malt polished oak spice smoked seaweed lightly tarred boat docks toasted nuts and lingering telicherry pepper. Mature yet still quite powerful. Rivals the original Talisker 25 year old and the Talisker 18 year old as one of the finest Talisker whiskies ever released."
3609,9,"A sophisticated and refined Talisker if that’s not an oxymoron. But this is certainly true when compared to the 10 year old. This 18 year old is deeper too with less of the fishnets more of oak boat docks. Less lemongrass more fruit gum drops. There’s still that knock-out punch on the finish. There’s a fine line between polishing the rough edges of a beautifully powerful whisky and ripping its heart and soul out with a knife by dumbing it down. This whisky has not crossed that line. A fabulous whisky!"
3610,6,"Distilled in 1982 this expression was matured in refill American oak hogsheads. It is the 16th Brora in the Special Releases series. Ripe pears and vanilla on the nose; progressively more perfumed with developing toffee notes. Slightly waxy on the palate with fresh-squeezed lemon and sweet background smoke contrasting with spicy dark berries. Plain chocolate sultanas and raisins in the medium-length finish. A relatively restrained Brora. (3000 bottles)"
3611,6,"This veteran Dalmore was matured successively in bourbon casks Matusalem oloroso sherry casks colheita port pipes more bourbon wood and finally Champagne casks. The nose offers orange marmalade vanilla milk chocolate maraschino cherries white pepper and a hint of black treacle. Sweet sherry and sultanas on the early palate with developing prunes and licorice. The finish is extremely long with increasing licorice plain chocolate wood spice and tannic oak. (50 bottles)"
3613,6,"This was distilled in 2012 and matured in 43 red wine casks that had been shaved toasted and recharred hence ‘STR.’ The nose offers rich creamy medicinal peat sea salt vanilla and loganberries. Sweet berry notes and caramel on the slick palate then peat gathers momentum with cinnamon and tangy citrus fruits. The finish features barbecue smoke chili and black pepper. (1920 bottles for the U.S.)"
3614,12,"Briny peat weaves through whipped cream Bosc pear and lemon peel on the undiluted nose; with water it opens to reveal layer upon layer of sweetness from fresh blueberries to brown sugar and cinnamon coffee cake molasses raisins and dried currants. On the palate the interplay of char and ash with vanilla brown sugar golden raisins and blueberry jam is punctuated with cinnamon pepper and minty tobacco. Beautiful length on the savory finish. (238 bottles)"
3615,9,"A thick lush whisky. Notes of honey-drenched citrus orange marmalade chewy toffee and almonds peppered with that classic coastal brine freshness and background spice I have come to love in Dalmore. Long contemplative finish. This whisky packs plenty of freshness and liveliness for 30 years on oak and is a pure joy to drink."
3616,12,"The nose has sweet smoke and more prominent aromas of banana vanilla guava papaya jasmine hibiscus and citrus oil with some salinity and chalky minerality. The palate is consistent: intense tropical fruit—guava mango coconut—plus hazelnut smoked almonds milk chocolate and salty kelp. It finishes with smoked nuts toasted tobacco chalky minerality dry oak and persistent fruitiness. Lots to unpack here and it develops beautifully with water—take your time."
3617,9,"A marriage of eight casks (seven hogsheads one sherry butt). A whisky in excellent shape for its age. Very clean and bright on the palate with no excessive oak. Notes of lemon tart clementine plum honeyed vanilla and polished oak peppered with clove soft mint marshmallow and subtle toasted coconut. Clinging mouth-coating finish.  £2250"
3618,2,"The sweet aromatic nose offers confectionery notes of cherry candy candied coconut cherry coulis raspberries marzipan and a hint of lime. Thick jammy and rich on the palate with notes of almond strawberry jam and chocolate syrup. It goes even further with water unlocking fresh notes of strawberries and cream allspice and sherried oak. The finish is equally rich exploding with cinnamon spice cooked red fruits dark chocolate and a Christmas-spice finale. (612 bottles)"
3619,2,"Baked apples cooked berries and antique leather on the nose along with scents of cedar chest spice cabinet and vanilla frosting. The palate is richly sherried and chewy but also bright and loaded with figs caramelized sugar chocolate dark berries tea clove and ginger. A mid-length finish reveals even more pronounced sherried notes and lively spice. Deliciously sippable; a slightly less complex but delightful bookend to the more mature GlenDronach cask expressions. (628 bottles)"
3620,9,"The good news: This is one of the best Highland Park whiskies I have ever tasted. The bad news: it’s the new release for Travel Retail (formerly Duty Free). It’s lush well-balanced and very complex. Well-defined notes of toffee candied fruit and roasted nuts are accentuated by background honey chocolate mousse and smoke. Here’s the icing on the cake: it’s bottled at 47.5% which really allows the flavors to shine. If you’re going overseas consider tracking down a bottle."
3621,9,"A polished very elegant expression with subtle complexity throughout. Notes of squeaky-clean fruit (tangerine peach nectarine kiwi) in light syrup. Vibrant spice (cinnamon white pepper anise) creamy vanilla and almond evolve on the palate leading to a gentle finish. Surprisingly lively for a whisky more than 30 years old. When I think of great Glenrothes vintages I go back to the 1972 vintage for comparison. Both are comparable in quality with the 1972 vintage showing darker sugars more weight and more roasted nuts."
3622,6,"Aged in newly toasted first-fill Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry-seasoned casks this veteran ‘beast of Dufftown’ makes a big impression. Sweet with smoky sherry fragrant pipe tobacco old leather walnuts vanilla and ripe cherries. The oily palate yields more leather blackcurrant cough drops nutmeg cloves Jaffa oranges and black tea. Raisins licorice and oak tannins before sweeter chocolate in the very long finish (3883 bottles; 276 for the U.S.)"
3623,6,"Distilled in 1989 and matured first in Pedro Ximénez then in oloroso sherry-seasoned casks. Delicate and restrained on the nose with apple pear drops ginger and malt. Initially sweet sherry then dark berry fruits emerge on the supple palate with oatmeal stout. More apples and ginger plus prunes and chili in the long warming finish. An excellent release from an underrated closed distillery. (4976 bottles; 600 for the U.S.)"
3624,1,"Bottled for Friends of the Classic Malts (which means most of you) this is Cragganmore in early autumnal guise. Dry leaves underfoot ripe black fruits on the bushes waxed jacket chestnut and a whiff of cedary smoke opening into dried peach. The palate is thickly textured with those fruits dark chocolate and pomegranate molasses. The immensely long finish gives you light pepper smoke and blackberry jam. Cragganmore at its very best and at a great price. £80"
3625,1,"OK confession time. This remains one of my favorite whiskies ever a classic example of what long slow aging in a refill cask can do for a whisky — increase its unctuous nature bring out butterscotch ginseng honey deepen the orchard fruits and release a dazzling spiciness on the tongue. It has balance it has finesse and there’s not much left. £155(Not available in the U.S.)"
3626,1,"Deep amber in color with the green glints of first-fill sherry this has bosky notes and meat—mutton and venison—plus graphite bitter chocolate and wet rock before layers of dried stone fruits and date. This is the most savory and Bovril-like of the new range. The palate is feral and earthy; think mushroom with game pie and rowan berries. Deep but with more dimensions than the previous 16 year old which in comparison seems like a blunt instrument. £180/500 ml"
3627,1,"Dark amber in hue this shows immediate mature elegance with great sweetness — think of spiced honey or mead. There are some light notes of pecan pie and all the while that thread of the sod. Glenfarclas can never fully escape its dark roots. There’s dried peach and fruit leather toffee and with water biscuits dunked in tea. The palate is autumnal and soft — fruit compote and peppermint. This is what you want from fully mature Glenfarclas at its peak. (U.S. exclusive)."
3628,6,"Part of the core range from GlenDronach Parliament has been aged in a mix of oloroso and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks and is non-chill filtered. Quite sweet sherry on the nose with fresh leather nutty peach notes cloves and pepper. Rich sherried fruits on the full palate with more pepper ginger and plain chocolate. The finish is long with licorice and oak tannins. Not to be rushed!"
3629,9,"An impressive single cask bottling of Glenfiddich. It really shows the natural potential of this distillery. Nothing fancy here just the pure elegance of Glenfiddich. Notes of shortbread demerara sugar and white chocolate spiced with toasted nuts cinnamon ginger and nutmeg. Very clean and polished."
3631,9,"Antique copper color with some streaks of gold. A complex array of dried fruit on the nose peppered with dried spice orange marmalade dark chocolate and wood shavings. On the palate the immediate impact is once again marmalade followed briefly by bramble before drier notes of dark chocolate wood shavings anise and subtle smoke emerge. Dry and spicy on the finish but never austere. A delicious contemplative 40 year old Highland Park that has aged gracefully.

This is a permanent addition to the range. Out of curiosity I tasted it next to the other great Highland Parks (the 30 year old and several very good single cask bottlings over 30 years old). This whisky is in the same league as the others. Its only down side is that it’s a lot more expensive than the others."
3632,7,"Exclusive Malts doesn't disclose the source distillery which doesn't matter when you’ve got a whisky that’s a gem. Apple cider defines the nose and is complemented by ginger and iris. On the palate this whisky is lush but well balanced with honeyed apple cider gingerbread cookie and baked apple. In the center of all this is rancio. Ginger spice and baked apple define the finish which is long and flavorful. Great balance integration and flavor. What more can you ask for? (U.S. only)"
3633,6,"The sixteenth Special Releases Port Ellen is the oldest to date. Initially sea breeze on the nose brine rock pools and gentle iodine followed by dried fruits peat and wood polish. Full-bodied very silky again with brine to the fore plus sweet peat drying slowly ginger black pepper and balancing tropical fruit notes. The finish is long with burnt oak embers and licorice. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (2900 bottles)"
3634,9,"The fifth in a series of Glenlivet Cellar Collection whiskies. This is a very complex whisky with exotic notes of oak sultana vanilla cream almonds and evergreen. These notes are quite floral on the nose and well balanced with no hint of excessive aging. The palate is polished deep and continuously evolving with a long spicy finish. The oak notes reveal that this whisky has some years on it but they in no way dominate or detract from the other flavors. An outstanding effort! This rivals the 1959 vintages as the best of the Cellar Collection releases. You’ll need deep pockets though."
3635,9,"Amber chestnut color. Aromas of mature oak leather ripe fruit and toffee are very deep and well balanced. Its flavors are rich and enveloping with notes of treacle toffee roasted nuts and a long spicy woody finish that lingers."
3636,1,"That rarely-spotted beast Dailuaine gets the Special Release treatment. This example has come from refill American oak and has immediate marzipan notes on top of the distillery’s fascinating mix of meaty density and sweetness. In time there are fat fruits Victoria plum bitter citrus faded green leafiness and chocolate notes. The palate is ripe rich and profound with a hint of tropical fruits cut with cacao. Long elegant and complex this is the best of this year’s bunch for me."
3637,6,"Another Special Releases staple this is the fifteenth and oldest Brora in the series to date. The nose offers hemp oiled brown paper lemon juice ashy peat and sweetening malt. The oily palate boasts sweet fruit notes peaty toffee and ginger. Long in the softly smoky finish with black pepper plain chocolate char and licorice. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (2984 bottles)"
3638,9,"Straw/honey color. Light to medium weight with a slightly oily texture. Shy on the nose but makes up for it on the finish. Fresh brine toasted coconut bright citrus fruit and subtle mint on a bed of vanilla cream and honeyed malt. The peat smoke is restrained on the nose but is more assertive on the palate and it really kicks in on the finish which is briny smoky appetizing and long. The best Longrow since the 1974 vintage. If it would only just open up a little more on the nose it would challenge the best from ‘73 and ‘74. (Only 120 bottles for the U.S.)"
3639,6,"This bottling from 1992 was distilled partly from dark-roasted chocolate malt. Classic Balvenie honey and fruit spices on the nose with light oiliness ginger and orange blossom. Rich flavors of canned pears and pineapple in syrup on the palate with hot chocolate and wood spices. Marzipan dark chocolate and black pepper in the long finish. A delightfully different Balvenie. (150 bottles)"
3640,6,"This has been Lagavulin’s principal expression for more than 30 years. Iodine rich peat and caramel on the early nose with sherry sea salt and charcuterie. The oily briny palate offers peat and a medicinal note along with black tea Seville orange toffee cinnamon and a hint of smoked fish. Peat embers and hot tar in the lengthy spicy finish. Deeply satisfying!"
3641,1,"Full gold. Weighty but not oppressed by wood. Full rich rancio aroma which brings to mind an ancient cognac. It is rich and powerful but has great finesse and perfect balance: cooked fruit some spice a lot of waxiness licorice…and then the distillery’s signature meatiness. The palate starts sweetly with ripe old autumn fruits and soft tannins. This has everything you want from a mature whisky and from Mortlach with added elegance. Highly recommended. £198"
3642,6,"Bottling at cask strength with only ‘barrier filtering’ to remove particles of char rather than the standard chill-filtration process gives the whisky greater integrity with heightened aromas and flavors and a satisfyingly sinewy mouthfeel not found in the standard 10 year old. Classic ‘burning hospital’ notes feature on the nose along with peaty malt vanilla lemon and brine. Charcuterie and cocoa powder add to the effect on the palate before phenolic medicinal and sweet malt notes bring things to a close. A must-have Laphroaig that represents a big step up in intensity. Number 7 in the 2018 Top 20"
3643,6,"This cask strength sherry cask matured expression was released as part of Lagavulin’s bicentennial celebration. The nose offers new leather tropical fruits brittle toffee and brine backed by spicy peat smoke. Smoky sherry notes open up in time. The rich well-mannered palate boasts sweet peat brine muted sherry figs gentle spices tangerines and lemons. Becoming more savory in the long gently smoky malty finish. Very drinkable at cask strength. A great Lagavulin. (8000 bottles)"
3644,6,"After many limited releases we finally have a permanent age-statement expression of Port Charlotte with a satisfying number of years under its belt. Distilled from Scottish-grown barley it is matured predominantly in first-fill American oak casks along with second-fill American and second-fill French wine casks. It is peated to 40ppm in line with other Islay heavy-hitters but the peat is never a blunt instrument retaining sufficient restraint to allow other characteristics—maritime notes the sweetness of caramel coconut and orchard fruits—to shine through. Number 4 in the 2018 Top 20"
3645,6,"The latest addition to Glenmorangie’s Bond House No. 1 collection is 23 years old. The nose is sweet and inviting with honey ginger vanilla fudge milk chocolate and nectarines. Very smooth on the palate: peaches in cream more milk chocolate caramel then spicy apricots. Long in the finish with orange rind and a hint of chile."
3646,1,"Scarcity and the secondary market have driven prices up so either buddy-up to a rich guy or club together to try this. Greater levels of cask interaction have added an extra dimension to a whisky that is often skeletal. The smoke’s in the background as salted cashew peppermint tansy furniture polish and smoked meats take center stage. The palate is slowly expanding and smoked with some chocolate and wax. Finally a Port Ellen that is truly classically mature. A killer. (2964 bottles)"
3647,9,"Finished in first-fill sherry casks for two years. My feeling on any whisky finished in a different cask is this: it should give as much to the flavor profile as it takes away. In this instance I feel it has and more. It’s not as nimble as younger versions but the sherry along with the extra aging contributes a silky texture and a richer fuller dimension to the whisky. I can still detect some of the peach vanilla tropical fruit and honeyed malt I enjoy in younger expressions but its key flavor components are toffee honey-dipped citrus red licorice chocolate-covered almonds and fig along with dried spice (cinnamon nutmeg mint tea) that emerges on the palate and peaks on the finish. The flavors are seamless and elegantly balanced."
3648,12,"A beguiling nose of raisins dried figs hazelnuts white chocolate brown sugar and candied ginger with a rich meatiness that calls to mind braised pork with stewed plums. The palate sings with classic sherry flavors: figs almonds hazelnuts dark chocolate white pepper orange peel and a lithe minerality. As might be expected given the ABV water may be added with impunity. From an undisclosed Highland distillery matured in a modified solera system and finished in a PX cask. (464 bottles; U.S. only)"
3649,6,"Ardbeg's first standard release in nearly a decade An Oa is matured in virgin oak Pedro Ximénez and bourbon barrels with component whiskies married in the distillery's French oak 'Gathering Vat.' The nose offers sweet peat smoky lemon rind ginger and angelica. A soft and sweet palate entry is followed by hot peat black tea peppery cloves and aniseed. Black pepper lingers through the long smoky finish."
3650,6,"A rare veteran bottling from Caol Ila and the oldest of the 2018 Special Releases this was aged in refill American oak hogsheads and refill European oak butts. The nose is fragrant and inviting with dried fruit ginger and beach bonfire. Vibrant tropical fruit on the palate with cinnamon and developing brine-sodden peat. Bold fruit flavors along with white pepper and soft peat remain in the lengthy finish. (3276 bottles) Collectible"
3651,6,"This 32 year old bottling was aged in twelve bourbon barrels and re-casked into fresh bourbon wood in 2009. It offers a nose of canned peaches dates marzipan and a hint of milky coffee. Rich fruit flavors lead on the palate: peach pineapple and mango with vanilla and nutty oak. Slowly drying in the finish with warming spices. Sometimes good bourbon casks are all you need. (3000 bottles)"
3652,12,"Historically used for blending Tamdhu flies under the radar of many scotch aficionados. But this underappreciated Speyside whisky compares well with more famous sherry bombs by offering a sweet savory slightly funky depth. At first sniff Tamdhu seems like it might knock you out with one blow—but this gentle giant is a lover not a fighter. Viscous and meaty this cask-strength stunner reveals dried fruit dark chocolate ganache ginger spice and saline minerality thundering softly into a long finish. Ian Macleod Distillers revived Tamdhu and their pledge to bring Rosebank back to life excites us to rediscover more top-quality whisky with a distinct identity. Number 8 in the 2017 Top 20"
3653,6,"Ardbeg doles out occasional limited releases for their avid fans but for nearly a decade the core range consisted of just three whiskies: 10 year old Uigeadail and Corryvreckan. The addition of An Oa matured in a combination of virgin oak Pedro Ximénez sherry and bourbon barrels and married in a French oak ‘gathering vat’ prior to bottling marks a reason to celebrate. An Oa is a more approachable Ardbeg. It lacks some of the typical oiliness but flavor and complexity abound with hot peat black tea and peppery cloves. Die-hard Ardbeg fans should have no complaints and new converts have a real treat in store. Number 6 in the 2017 Top 20"
3654,9,"Astar’s flavor profile is similar to Glenmorangie 10 year old in many respects showing a superb balance of sweetness fruit and spice. It’s not as subtle as the 10 year old expression but it is creamier richer and fleshier with loads of honeyed vanilla coconut cream pie toasted almond vibrant spice (cinnamon mint) and a basketful of citrus and summer fruits. The fact that it is bottled at 100 British Proof (57.1% abv) just accentuates every flavor and helps to make this whisky quite invigorating. Imagine Glenmorangie 10 year old with a shot of testosterone. I don’t rate very many ten year old (or younger ) whiskies over 90. This whisky has certainly earned it."
3655,6,"A turbocharged version of the formidable standard 10 year old Cask Strength varies in ABV from batch to batch. Tar and antiseptic hit the nose immediately along with peat smoke malt newsprint and new leather. There’s also lemon vanilla and brine. The sinewy palate mirrors the nose adding charcuterie and cocoa powder. Predictably medicinal and phenolic in the very long finish with balancing sweet malt."
3656,6,"Initially aged in bourbon barrels before being transferred into quarter casks and ultimately oloroso sherry butts. The sherry influence adds an additional dimension to the quarter-cask style hence an oily nose of dates vanilla tropical fruits and bonfire smoke. The palate is drier than might be expected with Laphroaig iodine barbecued meats muted sherry and peat smoke. The finish comprises dried fruits and lots of oak."
3657,6,"Initially matured in bourbon barrels then transferred to two Graham’s port colheita pipes from 1961 and 1963. Finally it was married in first-fill bourbon casks. Wood resin canola oil sultanas and red currants on the nose. Medium-bodied with sweet resin honey and sherry on the palate turning to treacle and raisins. The finish is very long with dark chocolate and spicy oak tannins. (500 bottles)"
3658,9,"Very sophisticated and subtly complex. Perhaps the lightest-colored of the bunch. Fresh appetizing brine and spice (cinnamon vanilla white pepper and clove) on a bed of soft honey and creamy vanilla with just a hint of fruit. The notes are bright clean and tight. Spicy briny finish. A beautifully delicate Highland Park. (Bottled for Green’s)"
3659,6,"Distilled in 1988 and finished for an unspecified period in port casks after lengthy maturation in bourbon barrels. Floral perfumed and very enticing on the nose. Vanilla fudge cocktail cherries polished oak and gentle spices. Soft and sweet on the palate with vanilla overripe orange cinnamon and milky coffee. Long and slightly peppery on the finish with persistent drying fruitiness. Complex and extremely accomplished."
3756,9,"A very richly textured Glenrothes. A heavy honeyed maltiness provides the foundation of this whisky with interwoven candied fruit notes (orange tangerine sultana) red and black licorice toffee and toasted almonds. Dry spicy oak notes balance its sweetness and provide depth. What impresses me most about this whisky is how it evolves on the palate and continues evolving through its lengthy finish."
3660,8,"Aging scotch in a secondary cask is tricky and tinkering with a whisky that has already achieved 18 years of age is even riskier. This well-matured Aberfeldy spent its final months in red wine casks from Bordeaux under the bold vision and deft hand of malt master Stephanie Macleod. As a result it soars above its station. Never intrusive the red wine finish suggests Fig Newtons and dried cherries building upon Aberfeldy’s classic honey-vanilla profile to evoke strawberry shortcake and flavors of jam and clotted cream on a fresh-baked scone. A complex mature and moreish whisky at an excellent price. Number 10 in the 2020 Top 20"
3661,12,"There’s something for everyone in this whisky whose citrus brightness acts as a deft foil for darker earthy notes showcasing the Highland distillery’s range. Lemon orange marmalade dried fig golden raisin milk chocolate and a touch of leather on the nose; then more marmalade chocolate toasted nuts cinnamon and lemon pepper on the creamy viscous palate. Still fresh with citrus the finish slowly gives way to savory tobacco leather cocoa powder and coffee bean. Subtle nuanced and perfectly balanced: a sleeper hit. Number 11 in the 2020 Top 20"
3662,12,"Glenmorangie has been growing its own barley for years but this U.S. exclusive marks the first release produced entirely from its estate-grown grain. Honeysuckle and jasmine waft over lemon curd and shortbread on the nose while bright aromas of blueberry and lime stand out. The palate is malty and full: shortbread with tumbling fresh blueberries toasted almonds and gingery spice. It’s silky rounded and seamless into the finish and beautifully transformed by a drop of water. Number 13 in the 2020 Top 20"
3663,1,"The hits just keep on coming for Glenfarclas. Here we see it not only with enormous age but in relaxed mode in terms of oak. You can tell it’s old: the leathery waxiness and exotic fruits of whisky rancio; you can tell it’s Glenfarclas because of the ever-present earthiness but both are intensified into a new aromatic realm: gentlemen’s barbershop rowan berry and images of an old bonfire next to a gingerbread house. Mysterious subtle and highly complex. £5995"
3664,8,"The iconic producer of lush sherried malts delivers again. Employing the same technique of marrying whiskies aged in sherry-seasoned casks of both American and European oak that landed the 12 year old in our 2017 Top 20 has resulted in a truly decadent dram—richly nutty and fruity with dried apples cherries and prunes. The palate is wonderfully luscious supple and chewy delivering mouth-coating waves of fruit that remain for minutes on end before a long farewell of lingering warming spice. Impressive and irresistibly good. Number 16 in the 2020 Top 20"
3665,6,"This 1978 vintage release from The Dalmore has been ‘finished’ for two years in Matusalem sherry casks from Gonzalez Byass following 29 years in American white oak. Just 477 bottles are available. Freshly-ground coffee marzipan dark berries and rich sherry on the smooth nose with milk chocolate and Jaffa oranges. Smokier with water. Citrus fruits and more milk chocolate on the rich full palate plus roasted almonds. Long and juicy in the finish with aniseed and fruit pastilles."
3666,9,"The newest offering from the impressive Balvenie vintage cask line. Honey caramel custard and Seville orange notes with evolving -- and increasingly noticeable -- dried spice oak resin and leather that integrates well with the sweet fruity notes. Incredible depth and complexity. The Balvenie vintage reputation remains intact."
3667,9,"The last Balvenie Vintage whisky I tasted that was this old was the exceptional 1966 Vintage. This new vintage has some big shoes (or should I say bottles?) to fill so how does it stand up to the 1966 Vintage? This 1973 Vintage is equally as impressive. In contrast to the massive evolving sherry-influenced 30 year old reviewed below this one shows more subtlety and finesse. It is also a very clean and polished affair-signs of an obviously excellent cask. A honeyed malty foundation incorporates notes of dried fruit (orange lemon) complex spice (vanilla cinnamon sandalwood) and subtle herbs. Very contemplative."
3668,9,"Deep amber color. Exotic aromas of honey vanilla and tropical fruit (coconut pineapple mango). Medium to full in body and rich in texture. The palate delivers what the aroma promises-honey vanilla and more tropical fruit with a somewhat dry and rather lengthy finish. The Balvenie distillery enjoys an excellent reputation. The older expressions are particularly noteworthy. They age very gracefully. This one is a pure joy to drink."
3669,12,"The yin to Aberlour A’bunadh’s yang this cask-strength single malt is matured entirely in bourbon casks rather than sherry. The result is a bracingly pure whisky with deceptive simplicity; its flavors are clean and its structure precise but it’s far from boring. The nose recalls black-and-white cookies vanilla-frosted yellow cake and shortbread with caramel topping along with honeysuckle jasmine and coconut cream. Mouth-coating and full it has flavors of poached pear malt balls nougat lemon curd toasted coconut and hints of spice. Vanilla chocolate and nut flavors are almost endless on the finish. Add water or don’t: this is delicious either way. Number 5 in the 2019 Top 20"
3670,12,"The nose immediately indicates the depth and complexity of this whisky: caramel praline Nutella figs raspberry jam candied rose petal Concord grape jelly dark chocolate-dipped gingerbread and leather book bindings all waft from the glass and then appear at the first sip buttressed by more spice marmalade pecans coffee and a touch of tobacco. The body is silky and pleasurable. It finishes with dried ginger tobacco mocha and savory oak—nuanced and perfectly balanced."
3671,12,"Refined aromas of dried apricots strawberries peonies candle wax marzipan graham cracker candied ginger and vanilla frosting carry through to the palate which showcases sugared almonds Raisinets dried apricots red berry jam Fig Newtons and savory tobacco. A few drops of water temper oak tannin. The finish is lengthy and complex yet soft with orange marmalade dark chocolate coffee bean dried cherries and ginger and tobacco. There’s a lovely delicacy among layered complexity."
3672,12,"Sherry dominates the nose rounding up stewed apples dark caramel raisins dates ground ginger dark chocolate and hazelnuts to go with the distillery’s characteristic tropical fruit aromas the result of extra-long fermentation with wine yeast. A well-textured palate showcases the same mix of sherry cask and spirit character with chocolate baking spices almond pineapple mango pistachio honey and ginger. The finish’s coffee-tinged oak is sweetened by dark chocolate-dipped dried mango and pineapple."
3673,6,"The nose offers canned peach halves in syrup peat smoke and brine. Oily in the mouth with sweet orchard fruits followed by a medicinal note pepper and dry spices. Plain chocolate and a hint of chili in the long finish with a final touch of coal dust. (U.S. exclusive; 115 bottles)"
3806,6,"The nose reveals blackcurrant damsons black pepper dark sherry coconut and nougat. Very smooth on the palate quite full with early oak then leather tropical fruits honey and resin notes from old component whiskies. A long finish with mango raisin hazelnut and lots of spice. Complex and intriguing. (12000 bottles)"
3674,10,"A riddle inside a bottle this release follows Glenlivet’s previous mystery series bottlings Alpha Cipher and Code. Packaged in a jet-black bottle and box that look part Arthur C. Clarke monolith and part 3-D cryptic crossword puzzle it’s devoid of cask information or tasting notes by design. The best solution is to open it and unlock the whisky’s secrets. Classic Glenlivet notes of lemon curd melon fresh peaches bitter orange and baked apples on the nose followed by a smooth creamy palate of marshmallow toasted almond marzipan and lemon iced tea. The long vibrant finish is replete with crème brûlée sultana cinnamon and tropical fruit. Number 8 in the 2019 Top 20"
3675,9,"Made from whisky aged in second fill American oak sherry casks distilled between 1973 to 1987. Richly malty with honeyed citrus juicy oak chocolate fudge and nougat. More subtle floral notes licorice (red and black) ginger and chamomile tea. Polished oak on the finish balances the sweetness. A great whisky to honor a great whisky maker! (Only 200 bottles for the U.S.)"
3676,6,"This 27 year old expression includes whisky matured in a mix of oloroso and Pedro Ximénez butts and puncheons. The nose is rich and inviting with freshly polished antique oak furniture cherry blossom and vanilla. Big sweet sherry notes on the palate with wood spice hazelnuts and cherry liqueur-filled dark chocolate. The long finish features ripe plums treacle and more dark chocolate. Luscious! (2293 bottles)"
3677,6,"This expression has been matured entirely in first-fill bourbon casks. The nose offers lemon juice squeezed onto hot baked salmon cooked over a wood fire then sprinkled with sea salt. Rich sweet tropical fruit flavors on the full palate with honey barley sugar peppery oak and mellow peat smoke. Dark chocolate dry peat and black pepper in the long mildly medicinal finish. Editors’ Choice"
3678,9,"Gold color. Peaty smoky mature aromas with notes of damp earth pencil shavings seaweed brine and vanilla. Oily viscous body. Flavors are similar to its aroma with a spicy salty black pepper dryish finish."
3679,2,"Part of Glenlivet’s mystery series the concept is to have drinkers form their impressions with no information about the whisky’s age or cask maturation although those details will be revealed at year’s end. The nose has notes of lemon curd melon fresh peaches bitter orange and baked apples. A nimble creamy palate offers marshmallow toasted almond marzipan and lemon iced tea. The finish has length and vibrance with crème brûlée cinnamon and a tropical note. A delicate enchanting whisky."
3680,9,"No frills here just pure unadulterated Bowmore. This Islay whisky speaks of its location in a very pure and natural way. I find invigorating brine seaweed green olive and fishnets along with the classic Bowmore peat smoke. All these flavors are softened by gentle vanilla and honeyed malt while background tropical fruit add complexity."
3681,2,"Distilled in 2011 and bottled in 2019 this is the first fully sherry-matured version of Kilchoman’s 100% Islay expression sold in the U.S. made with barley grown and malted on-site and from a cask selected by importer ImpEx. A bold complex nose of peat smokehouse dried leaves and lime. Bitter chocolate and raisins on the palate and a finish of blackberry coulis chocolate and pepper. A tour de force from this young distillery. (U.S. exclusive; 329 bottles)"
3682,9,"Amber-chestnut color. Aromas are very mature and so thick one almost needs a knife to cut it. Notes of dried fruit (orange lemons pineapple) and wood spices (especially clove) with more than a suggestion of peat smoke. Thick enveloping texture-like a warm coat on a bitterly cold day. Very mature. One can easily deduce this is a very old whisky-the woodiness is evident on the palate. But it is not in excess. There’s plenty of dried fruit enticing wood spices and peat to keep the palate entertained all the way through to its very long dry finish."
3683,1,"A sherry-cask Lagavulin this immediately shows a rich mellow power with a touch of potter’s wheel but it needs water to bring out sandalwood beach bonfire kombu Lapsang Souchong and bog myrtle. The palate is where it shows itself fully; resinous and thick unctuous even with that scented pine/juniper tea note shifting into paprika-rubbed ham membrillo currants blackberry. I’ve a feeling that this period will be seen as Lagavulin’s golden age. £99"
3684,6,"Aged in a European oak oloroso sherry hogshead. Orange marmalade and lanolin on the nose with caramel and candle wax dripped onto old leather. Full-bodied with slightly bitter orange notes plus nutmeg and aniseed on the palate. The orange theme persists into the finish as dried-out Jaffa segments plus edgy oak tannins. A highly individualistic Balvenie."
3685,9,"By far the softest and gentlest of the range and oh so drinkable. Hard to believe that this whisky is 40 years old actually as it shows no sign of excessive oak. Instead there are soothing layers of caramel and toffee as the whisky’s foundation. Add orange marmalade and other juicy citrus fruits cinnamon spice graham cracker and lightly toasted almond. A gentle subtly sophisticated Dalmore and an interesting comparison to the much different more visceral 50 year old. If I were a rich man I could drink this whisky every day — it’s so easy-going."
3686,12,"Sweet and clean with aromas of honeysuckle confectioners’ sugar lemon fresh jasmine nougat and coconut cream. The palate is remarkably consistent with lemon curd toasted coconut sprinkled over oatmeal vanilla cookie pear and juicy citrus. A lengthy finish of grapefruit lemon and apple continues the theme. The clean spirit-driven profile might give the impression of simplicity but the high ABV ensures there is much to unpack. (Individual reviewer rating: 92)"
3687,7,"This single cask distilled at Highland Park is an excellent example of why distilleries sell off certain casks. On the nose it’s Highland Park's signature sherry and peat but on the palate it's a beast. Monster peat smoke surfs on a lush layer of berry and malt. This builds to a peak with smoke salt and oak spice bolstered by the high proof. A smoky dry finish rounds off a monster whisky different from Highland Park's style but very interesting. (Julio’s Liquors only)"
3688,6,"An old Special Releases favorite this is the fourteenth such Brora bottling. Distilled in 1977 and matured in refill American oak hogsheads it is the oldest Brora issued by Diageo to date. 2976 bottles have been released. Leather ginger and stewed fruits on the nose with smoky dusty aromas. Lighter and fresher than previous veteran releases with cooking apples cinnamon fudge dried grass and light peat on the palate. Sweet notes fade leaving earthy savory smoke in the long finish."
3689,9,"Full-flavored confident and very dynamic. Bright fruit teasing toffee complex spices cereal grain and underlying light leather notes are all tightly integrated. Think an 11 year old whisky can’t be mature or complex? Think again! A Speyside powerhouse! (Available in the Chicago area.)"
3958,6,"Faint smoke on the nose with orange and malt. Floral notes in time plus nougat.
More orange and star anise on the palate with overt woodsmoke old leather and
developing dark chocolate. The finish is long and lightly smoky. (1380 bottles) £6500"
3690,1,"Now the one that peat freaks wait patiently for every year which makes it the bottling that produces the most debate. For me this is up there with last year’s bottling which itself ushered in a return to high standards after a slight dropping-off in expressiveness.
This is different however. Yes the color is as pale as ever — has anyone ever tasted an over-oaked Port Ellen? — and yes the nose initially shows all of the distillery’s austere notes: think of a wet fish counter and the sensation of the sea rather than overt ‘fishiness’ while there’s also a chilled cucumber note. The difference is the sweetness which is more to the fore and also it would seem a slight dropping-off in massive smokiness. Here the peat is integrated into the whole.
The palate has a numb spot right on the front then wasabi-like heat coupled with olive oil. Soon the sea rolls in and it stands there like some creature from the Black Lagoon covered with balls of tar draped in wet seaweed encrusted with barnacles and clams — and clutching a kipper. But don’t forget the sweetness that spreads across the tongue and slowly drifts into fresh spice and antiseptic. Complex…and there’s a scant 3000 bottled for the globe. [not available in the U.S.] £280"
3691,9,"This gem is soft and seductive in personality. It is also very clean and still quite fresh for its age-obviously aged in an excellent cask. You'll find a bed of gentle sweetness reminding me of coconut cream and vanilla mousse. A mélange of fruit (melon black raspberries strawberries) marries perfectly with the sweetness. Fresh brine notes and licorice root emerge on the palate and become more prominent towards the finish. This Legacy III is more polished and rounded and not as tired or woody when compared to the recent 40 year old bottling. And the 40 year old at $2200 a pop is also about five times more expensive."
3692,6,"Perfumed on the nose with fresh-cut flowers canned peaches in syrup butterscotch and white chocolate. More canned peaches orange peel apple crumble hazelnuts and heather honey on the palate. The finish is long and peppery. Remarkably vibrant for its age. (363 bottles 38 for U.S.)"
3693,6,"The latest annual limited release is classic and sure to please true aficionados of Macallan. Stewed fruit and old leather on the nose along with ripe cherries gingersnaps and black pepper before orange marmalade notes develop. Full-bodied with fragrant sweet orange milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight and faint smoke. The finish yields dark chocolate cherry liqueur and more pepper. Long and spicy."
3694,1,"Port Ellen’s make was usually filled into old casks to maximize its smoke when used young. To us therefore it’s Islay’s most austere malt yet the guys who worked there all talk of its sweetness. Here finally is an example of that. Yes there’s some wet slate and briny smoke but it’s balanced by citrus waxy fruits and a central sweetness adding complexity. It might have taken a long time to get here but it was worth the wait. (Editor's Choice)"
3695,6,"This 29 year old expression was matured in six oloroso sherry casks before a final period of finishing in Pedro Ximénez casks. The nose yields black currant juice spilled onto old leather then cigar boxes along with plump sultanas soaked in sherry. Voluptuous and silky on the palate with rich sherry dates walnuts and black treacle. Tingling spices molasses and licorice in the lengthy satisfying finish. (3052 bottles)"
3696,6,"This expression has returned to the shelves after a three-year absence due to a shortage of stock. Matured in Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry casks. The nose offers rich sherry ripe cherries walnuts milk chocolate and marzipan with a savory hint. Full-bodied with a palate of spicy damsons cinnamon dried fruits and dark chocolate. The finish is long with cloves and blackcurrants. Luscious!"
3697,12,"Bright fresh and sweet on the nose with green apple melon sugared lemon slice almond cream vanilla and a hay field in the sun. The proof gives this ample body and allows flavors of fizzy lemon fresh ginger orange scone caramel-dipped apple honeysuckle and toasted coconut to spread out over a layer of savory oak. It’s not quick to move on lingering with a rounded finish of white pepper fresh ginger lemon oil and oak. (Editors' Choice)"
3698,6,"One of two recent vintage releases this 1971 example has been matured in seventeen Spanish oak casks that yielded a total of 657 bottles. Sweet on the nose with maple syrup almonds and sherry. Soft and insinuating. Becoming progressively smokier. Bold fruit and peat notes on the palate plus oak cloves and dark chocolate notes. Peppery in the long finish with subtle tannins and persistent citrus fruits."
3699,1,"Lagavulin from a first-fill sherry butt? There’s unusual. This is huge fluxing and complex mixing saddles and dark chocolate pu-erh tea and smothered kiln geranium and velvet gamey venison and treacle. The smoke is integrated the fires ember-like the oak there but not oppressively so. Massive dense layered and complex this needs time to open. In short a distillation of Islay and up alongside last year’s Jazz Festival bottling."
3700,7,"Not what you’d expect from a malt at this age. Instead of oak dominating the nose it's citrus in focus with orange marmalade candied orange and even orange blossom. On the palate this whisky is light and delicate leading with the citrus notes from the nose. This symphony of orange is followed with toffee ginger oak and rancio in a combination that's well balanced and integrated. Unique for its age a definite treat for those who prefer lighter and more delicate whiskies. (U.S. only 600 bottles)"
3701,6,"The nose opens with relatively light sweet woodsmoke then red apples sherry iodine sea salt and lively spices emerge. Spicy citrus fruits toffee and more sweet smoke on the palate. The finish carries citrus fruits with sherry spice and peat smoke. (12400 bottles 1440 for U.S.)"
3702,12,"There’s no color added so that striking red hue comes entirely from the ruby port cask that makes up 50% of this whisky’s maturation program—and that cask shows up in full force flavor-wise. Vinous aromas of red fruits plum blueberry and pomegranate penetrate the charcoal peat of the nose. Zingy spice—ginger cinnamon black pepper and fresh chile—undergirds berries salty and ashy peat and dark chocolate on the silky palate and the finish is mouth-puckering with salt water and oak fading gently. (1266 bottles)"
3703,12,"A bright and delicate nose is spritzed with lemon and mandarin orange perfumed with salt-sprayed hibiscus and supported by the creamy sweetness of almonds and pistachios. Consistent on the palate which shines with zingy zesty lemon orange and grapefruit though cinnamon peppermint almonds and oak offer a tempering influence. It finishes with sweet mint and oak cinnamon and a creeping tobacco flavor—the end of a great cigar. (Collectible)"
3720,2,"Fully matured in rye barrels. Butterscotch almond paste shortbread lemon cake and vanilla frosting on the nose—bakery aromas integrating with notes of crushed seashells and briny peat. The palate is soft honeyed and sweet offering flavors of candied orange slices iced tea chocolate and sugared espresso as a more pronounced peat influence emerges. A lengthy finish as the peat drifts into the background leaving a delicious pot of honey candied fruit and dark chocolate."
3704,1,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. First-fill sherry wood makes a return here and adds its own rich dried fruitiness — think sultana cake — to the exotic whisky rancio notes of cheese rind sealing wax and roasting pheasant. As it opens there’s fig some peat smoke black cherry and concentrated stone fruits. This exotic/savory/sweet interplay continues on the tongue where there’s a surprising hint of mint and some pear blossom. The finish is long with apple skin gingerbread and walnut. A discreet nod to cognac. £1250"
3705,6,"Talisker is a Special Releases favorite and this bottling the oldest ever marketed by the distillery is actually the sixteenth. Distillation was in 1977 and maturation has taken place in both American and European oak refill casks. Soft wood smoke sultana nutmeg and chili powder on the nose. Dried fruits vanilla and malt merge with more chili and savory notes plus newly-dug soil on the complex palate. A touch of brine orange peel and bonfire in the finish. 3090 bottles."
3706,6,"Matured exclusively in sherry-seasoned first-fill European oak casks and bottled at cask strength. The nose yields figs soft smoke cinnamon sugarcane and rich fruitcake. The palate is succulent and confident with creamy sweet sherry dried fruits coffee and woodsmoke. Long and drying in the finish with flecks of char. Highland Park doing what it does best. (28000 bottles)"
3707,12,"Though initially reticent the aromas are lovely: rose petal lemon peel apricot candle wax and a touch of tobacco. Full-bodied in the mouth with crème brûlée baked apple toasted nuts semi-sweet chocolate toffee ginger and baking spices plus bright floral rose oil and lemon peel. The lengthy finish runs to burnt chocolate roasted nuts coffee grounds and a hint of tobacco."
3708,12,"Initially matured in bourbon casks for 7 years this spends another 2 years in quarter casks taking on aromas of vanilla shortbread canned pineapple chunks wax and cinnamon all buffeted by the bright saltiness of fresh sea air. A hefty deep palate is unencumbered by the cask and instead trumpets its clean sweet flavors: lemon orange pineapple fresh ginger blueberry cinnamon shortbread and saline. Full-flavored to the last this whisky is muscular but never aggressive."
3709,9,"This whisky starts out rich and lush-both in aroma and on the palate with notes of fig cake candied fruit and sticky toffee pudding. Citrus fruit (orange lemon tangerine)-a characteristic that emerges with many older whiskies-cuts through the heft and lushness of this whisky contributing complexity balance and drinkability. The whisky continues to evolve serving up notes of almonds exotic spice and polished leather on the finish. An excellent example of what a mature Speyside whisky should taste like."
3710,9,"Comes across initially to me as reserved perhaps even elegant for a Talisker. Soothing too with an oily texture. Quite fruity (orange tangerine apricot) perhaps even floral with a delicate pastry sweetness. Then the more traditional Talisker notes kick in -- brine seaweed warming pepper -- repeated in the finish. A high-quality Talisker; albeit a bit reserved at times. I love the oily viscous texture."
3711,9,"Clean and complex showing a matured somewhat restrained personality for Laphroaig: less medicinal but more rounded. Tar pencil shavings anise honeyed citrus Spanish olive brine and a hint of seaweed and white pepper on a bed of creamy vanilla caramel and light nougat. Lingering satisfying finish. Frustrated by a dearth of 20-plus year old distillery-bottled Laphroaigs? Look no further. Delicious!"
3712,1,"Though quiet to start the impression is of a fog of smoke balled up within a dunnage
warehouse ready to erupt to add itself to the cool spearmint and oxidized
nuttiness. The palate is where it shows its class: mature slowly unfolding and
layered with Latakia tobacco menthol nori white pepper pear and a massive
tarry Bohea Souchong tea element on the finish. Everything from Lagavulin is
touched with gold at the moment. Try to find a bottle. (distillery only) £99"
3713,6,"Influenced by a final decade spent in oloroso sherry and Burgundy casks. The nose offers orange segments dipped in honey plus nougat icing sugar and more piercing citrus notes. The palate is supple with milk chocolate and orange juice joined by damsons and wood spices. A mouth-drying note persists behind juicy fruits with aniseed and black pepper. The finish yields peaches dipped in salt and spicy oak. Collectibles"
3714,1,"The nose is fascinating as if dust is cohering into form and fruity form at that. When it emerges there’s baked banana fruitcake citrus peels passion fruit mango mace flower and nutmeg. A mossy edge anchors it to earth. Even livelier with water this is a superbly balanced mature whisky. The palate is pure with big retronasal impact of the spice. Layered and long it’s at its best neat; you need the intensity to amplify all the complexity. Superb."
3715,6,"Tangerines on the nose then Turkish Delight sliced cucumber new leather toffee soft spices and a hint of char. Mouth-coating with sweet orchard fruits dipped in cream. Sharper fruit notes in time with almonds and ginger. Icing sugar milk chocolate spicy oak a fleeting savory note and lingering fruitiness in the finish. Shows well-integrated character. (18000 bottles) Collectibles"
3716,6,"The nose is nutty and yields sweet sherry Jaffa orange old leather instant black coffee and a suggestion of ozone. The palate is oily and textured with more sherry dried fruits nutmeg and dark chocolate. The finish lingers with brine and pepper."
3717,2,"Earthy with charcoal smoke on the nose sea shells citrus oil and a candied note of lemon pastille. A powerful palate offers bonfire smoke iodine grilled sausage and black pepper with lemon oil bitter chocolate and light earthiness. The finish has some salinity as well as more bonfire smoke and bitter espresso. Assertive but balanced well-structured and smooth. A dynamic whisky that’s an iron fist in a velvet glove. (230 bottles for U.S.)"
3718,1,"Any sherried Laphroaig is welcome and this does not disappoint. Rich resinous medicinal with underlying soft fruits the smoke is all-pervading but never dominant. In other words it isn’t just complex and balanced but has that other dimension which elevates it in mind (and marks). With water there’s antiseptic cream mingling with oxidized fruits and nuts; think manzanilla pasada. The palate shows storm clouds gathering over Texa. Rich dried fruits cacao and a ferny lift on the finish. Fantastic. (The Whisky Exchange only)  £100"
3719,9,"A deep mature Tomintoul that manages to retain the elegance and drinkability found in younger Tomintoul whiskies. Roasted nuts lush fruit suggestions of cherry brandy and orange marmalade layered with rich fudge toffee and maple syrup. Soothing finish. Tomintoul can be a simple whisky at a younger age but this one has matured into a beautifully complex dram. (Bottled for Park Avenue Liquors.)"
3722,2,"Tropical notes of lemon and lime on the nose along with delicate peat. Creamy on the palate with a blast of peat smoke integrating seamlessly with notes of vanilla manuka honey tropical fruit and dried seashells. The finish offers red berries apples hibiscus and more honey along with a flavorful back note of peat char. Smooth and lightly fruited with the peat providing a balanced backdrop for the sweeter notes in store. (510 bottles)"
3723,9,"One of the first wood finishing efforts under Edradour’s new management. Very creamy in texture with notes of sticky toffee vanilla fudge fruit cake raisin and burnt almonds. All this sits on a bed of dry minty resinous oak. The flavors dovetail nicely with a soothing satisfying finish. The port wood finishing adds complexity without dominating."
3724,12,"The nose is sweet but a bit shy needing time to fully open into rose petal raspberry fig jam raisin sweet orange candied grapefruit peel and green apple candy. It gives no indication of the sweeping elegant smoke of the palate which brings dryness to the dark and dried-fruit flavors. A touch of water helps integrate and lengthen the experience though it finishes rather quickly with soft ashy smoke raspberry jam and persistent bitter chocolate."
3725,6,"This expression was distilled from malt peated to 12 to 14 ppm and aged for 9 years in 80% bourbon and 20% sherry casks before a final year in more sherry casks. Sweet smoke on the early nose with malt vanilla quite dry sherry apple and toffee. Smoky barley vanilla subtle sherry and light honey on the palate. Peaches ginger and woodsmoke on the medium-length finish. Very accomplished. Editors' Choice"
3726,2,"Christmas warmth in a glass its maturity showing in complex aromas of baked apple poached pear Christmas cake cinnamon gingerbread and cloves enlivened by a tropical note of lime and a hint of peat. More baking spices on a rich palate that offers milk chocolate melted caramel and strawberry jam with water bringing out notes of candied fruit chocolate and more light peat. Nimble spiced and replete with flavors to treasure."
3727,6,"This 42 year old expression was matured in a single American oak hogshead (#4606) and offers a lovely mature fruity nose especially peaches and pineapple plus vanilla and marzipan. Smooth and rich on the palate with sherry hessian and spicy pineapple. Dries steadily but satisfyingly with a hint of smoky fruit. Another veteran classic from the team at Forres. (52 bottles) £1400"
3728,6,"Quintessence is the first single malt to have undergone secondary maturation in five different types of California red wine casks: zinfandel pinot noir syrah merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Sweet sherry ripe cherries marzipan and white pepper on the nose. Rich and mouth-coating; strong flavor of thick-cut orange marmalade oloroso sherry malt and milk chocolate. The finish features gentle warming spice and lingering Jaffa orange. Plain chocolate and orange notes seem as though they are never going to end! £1000"
3729,9,"Aged 2.5 to 3 years on bourbon casks and then finished in sherry casks for 6 months. Wow this is quite stunning! Old-fashioned in many respects: oily texture with rooty layered peat smoke coal tar shoe polish and hints of wet sheep as the foundation for a complex array of additional flavors: toffee apple caramel fudge blackberry jam golden raisin grist bourbon barrel char and licorice root. Long smoldering ember dried herb light toffee finish. It’s all balanced perfectly and very mature for its age. If you like smoky whiskies track one down. (Not available in the U.S.) £37.00"
3730,6,"Fleeting green foliage on the early nose then orange blossom and fragrant spices emerge with vanilla that’s cut through by lemon. Big fresh orange notes on the palate with brittle toffee and encroaching dark chocolate. The finish is long with lingering chocolate spicy oak and citrus fruit. £4000"
3731,6,"Slightly oily on the nose with old leather ginger and furniture polish. Ultimately red berry notes. The palate is initially sweet and fruity with polished oak aniseed and wood spices. The finish dries slowly with oak tannins but a spicy fruit note never quite disappears. £1200"
3732,12,"The nose is aromatic with peach blossom apple skins sugared strawberries strands of cotton candy biscuity malt blanched almonds and green tea leaves. Rounded and soft on the palate there are flavors of apricots peaches and bright red cherries firmly supported by malt; with water the fruit is more pronounced and uplifted by a bracing tide of nuts milk chocolate oak and tea leaves. The finish retains fruitiness but is focused on nuts tobacco and leathery oak. (92 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3733,12,"On the nose intense fruit underlaid with smoke: a grilled half-peach. Hints of cinnamon and milk chocolate; blackberry jam; brisket. With water the peat turns slightly rubbery and mineral and that minerality carries into the palate balanced by juicy berries Raisinets and almonds. Curling wisps of pipe smoke wrap around smoked almonds and sea salt-sprinkled dark chocolate on the finish. Though hefty it’s pretty easy to drink at full strength; add a bit of water and you’ll soften the alcohol without diminishing any of the flavor. (607 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3734,12,"The nose is rich but not heavy showing applesauce poached pears grape jelly raisin scones nutty dark chocolate and a hint of orange. Zingy with citrus oil especially lemon on the palate though that’s tempered by oak raisins toasted nuts dark chocolate and leather. It finishes with more nuts coffee bean pipe tobacco and persistent lemon oil; a final note of poached pear recalls the nose. Elegant. (246 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3735,1,"Rising above the tat issued to celebrate the nuptials of Prince William and Kate Middleton was this extremely limited (1000 bottles) release from The Macallan. The nose is a mélange of rich fruits marzipan and beeswax/resin but it lifts with a drop of water to show apricot and heavy florals. The palate isn’t overly grippy with more orange peel almond and characteristic oiliness. A malty/nutty smooth finish makes this a great one. £150 (Not available in the U.S.)"
3736,6,"The nose yields tangerines linseed marzipan ginger and honey followed by a mild menthol note. Rounded and chewy on the palate with lively orchard fruit flavors turning to slightly bitter Seville orange and light chile. Licorice root and tannins develop in the very long citric finish. (62 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3737,6,"Deep notes of wood polish on the floral nose with toffee and a whiff of cloves. The palate is slick with Christmas pudding orange caramel oak and dark chocolate. Black coffee citrus fruit ginger and black pepper in the lengthy finish."
3738,7,"Finally an unimpeachable counterpoint to the rally cry against no age statement whisky. Oban Little Bay is everything that Oban 14 is and more. A rich fruity malty nose showcases dried apricot dark chocolate and salt. On the palate Little Bay explodes with flavor combining malt with orange chocolate and blackberry. Clove and oak spice join the party in the mid-palate which shows superb balance and integration. A long slightly dry citrusy spice finish caps off a stunning whisky."
3739,9,"Similar to the standard Ardbeg 10 year old except that a portion of the whisky was aged in heavily charred barrels (referred to as an “alligator” char). An aggressive whisky — even for Ardbeg — with a leathery texture throughout. Dynamic too with coal tar soot bourbon barrel char espresso cocoa licorice root smoked fish and a hint of ginger. There’s a nice creamy vanilla underbelly to balance the aggressiveness and (at least partially) muzzle the Alligator."
3740,6,"The Renaissance began with a 15 year old expression and charts the same spirit as it continues to mature. Aged in bourbon and sherry casks the 3rd Chapter exhibits a sweet and sophisticated nose of honey milk chocolate Brazil nuts toffee and ripe peaches. Supple on the palate with luscious orange and peach notes vanilla oak and subtle spice. Plain chocolate-coated orange confectionery in the finish with caramel and ginger. Balanced and delicious! £100"
3741,12,"Lemon curd on shortbread and sweet salty smoke hit the nose to start followed by stone fruit fresh pears citrus and peppermint candies. In the mouth it's ashy and oily with oyster shell and cigar; add a few drops of water and suddenly it bursts into Technicolor—blueberries juicy dark fruits spiced chocolate and vivid peppery spice. Explosive on the finish with powerful notes of bitter chocolate cinnamon espresso and lingering ash. (1260 bottles)"
3742,6,"Intended to showcase the color of Macallan the fifth annual Edition release has been aged in a variety of American oak casks. The nose is initially reticent and offers dried fruits salted caramel sawdust and ginger. Extremely smooth on the palate with more dried fruits ripe plums milk chocolate new leather and black pepper. The finish is medium in length with leather and dark chocolate."
3743,6,"This 41 year old single cask was aged in a sherry butt and interacted magnificently with that wood. The nose offers peeled red apples sultanas honey fudge milk chocolate and American cream soda. Balanced and harmonious throughout the palate yields remarkably fresh orchard fruits pipe tobacco black pepper and ginger. Long in the finish with cinnamon drying to dark chocolate and slightly smoky unobtrusively tannic oak. A 1970s classic!"
3744,6,"Bottled to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Ardbeg Committee. Woodsmoke on the nose with coal fires cedar canned fruit cocktail and mild antiseptic. Supple and sweet on the palate with orchard fruits and an emerging wave of peppery prickly peat smoke. Long in the sooty finish. Lively with chile paste."
3745,6,"Full-on Ardbeg on the nose! Hot tar lemon juice charcuterie thick peat smoke ginger and a hint of Jaffa oranges. The palate is oily and well-integrated with black pepper coal tar soap cloves vanilla and orchard fruits. Spicy in the lengthy finish with more tar peat and salty oak."
3746,6,"The annual bottling for 2020 was matured in bourbon barrels and second-fill ruby port barriques married together and finished in red wine casks. Ripe strawberries iodine and peat on the nose. Red berry jam in time. Flinty with sea salt. Creamy on the palate with caramel hot tar sweet red wine burning peat antiseptic chile and brine. Licorice pepper and drying peat in the long satisfying finish."
3747,9,"Whiskies distilled at Glenlivet might be easy to find throughout the world but this is a good thing. Take this one from Duncan Taylor—it’s delicious! It’s elegantly complex with a tropical accent (coconut pineapple) strawberries with whipped cream and caramel-dipped apple. The sweetness is never heavy or cloying and it’s balanced by lovely dried spice throughout (vanilla ginger soft mint nutmeg) and especially towards the finish. Nicely done!"
3748,6,"GlenDronach 15 year old Revival went on hiatus three years ago due to a shortage. In 2018 it re-emerged with a new recipe tweaked by master distiller Rachel Barrie. As before a mixture of Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry casks has taken care of the aging process and the result is one of the very best sherried single malts of its age on the market. The distillery’s characteristic spice fruit and chocolate notes are here in abundance merging seamlessly and with satisfying complexity to create a great after-dinner dram. Number 8 in the 2018 Top 20"
3749,6,"Formerly known as Darkest this expression was given a secondary maturation for 3 years in oloroso sherry casks. The nose features smoky caramel dates citrus fruits and quite dry sherry. Dark chocolate and cocktail cherries on the rich malty palate with peat smoke and a hint of dry oak balancing the sweet fruitiness. Sherry brine soft peat oak and allspice in the lingering finish."
3750,6,"This first cask-strength expression in Highland Park’s core range was matured predominantly in sherry-seasoned American oak. Honey bonfire smoke orange peel and a suggestion of treacle on the nose. Sweet and smoky on the palate with toffee and orchard fruits turning more citric in time. The finish yields sweet spices more honey dark chocolate black pepper and bonfire embers. Classic Highland Park—turned up to 11! Editors' Choice"
3751,9,"Amber color with shades of chestnut. Full complex aromas of fruit (cherries currants berries) marzipan Demerara sugar roasted nuts and molasses. Full in body with flavors that deliver what its aroma promised. Satisfying finish."
3752,9,"I am amazed by how many old sherried Glen Grant whiskies have been released to the market in the past ten years. (Did the distillery owners at the time also own sherry bodegas or what?) Anyway some of these have been dark decadent and delicious and I’ll put this whisky in that category. Chestnut colored with lush fruit treacle dark chocolate leather tobacco roasted walnuts and cherry cough syrup. A complex well-structured whisky."
3753,6,"This 44 year old was matured in oloroso casks before being bottled at cask strength in May 2016. Mellow sherried fruit on the nose with rose hips vanilla fudge almond honey and slightly earthy spices. The fragrant palate features an intense blast of ripe fruit caramel and sweet spices while resin develops in time. The medium-length finish offers plain chocolate raisins and prunes with no negative tannins. One of the best Tomatins to date."
3754,6,"A mix of 29 bourbon and sherry casks that were mingled for 3 months in Balvenie’s bespoke marrying vessel the Tun. Fragrant oriental spices on the nose: ginger cinnamon fresh orange juice and brittle toffee. Full and smooth on the palate with sweet sherry and spicy Jaffa orange. Long in the finish with dark chocolate oak tannins raisins and licorice at the close."
3755,6,"This 2017 release includes spirit from three sherry-seasoned hogsheads and three butts some of which had previously held a peated whisky. The nose offers familiar dark chocolate dried fruit sultanas and ripe cherry notes with a whiff of woodsmoke. More dried fruits on the rich palate with coffee grounds ginger and sherry merging with subtle peat. The finish is luxurious with smoky raisins and pleasing wood spice. (40 bottles for U.S.)"
3959,9,"A very clean elegant Bowmore with a naked beauty that shows its Islay roots. You’ll find fresh brine and seaweed on a bed of honeyed malt and soft vanilla cream. Subtle berries citrus and melon fruit add a complex fruit dimension. Fresh appetizing finish. Nicely done! (Exclusive to The Party Source.)"
3757,9,"Glenrothes is one of those Speyside whiskies which matures very gracefully. Recent distillery bottlings (i.e. the 1979 and 1972 vintages) prove this point. This Signatory bottling also demonstrates that Glenrothes has the ability to get older and better. In this offering the palate-coating sticky caramel syrupy maltiness of the whisky is rescued by firm bold dry oak spice and lush fruit. Delicious toffee and roasted nuts longer on the finish. The 30 years in oak gives this whisky great depth and bottling the whisky at natural cask strength ensures that the whisky is not cut off at the knees. A soothing post-prandial affair."
3758,0,"The relentless upward march of prices for well-aged scotch is discouraging to veteran whisky drinkers and newcomers alike. At just $90 this lovely Speyside 18 year old hearkens back to the good old days of single malt. A warm soft and rounded whisky with pleasing melon and apricot flavors hints of dried hay and apple pie à la mode and a backbone of peppery fruit and malt Glen Moray 18 year old isn’t about bombast. It balances delicacy and strength rather than embracing raw power. Although it’s celebrating its 120th anniversary this year Glen Moray isn’t very well known in the United States but that may be about to change. Number 10 in the 2017 Top 20"
3759,6,"The nose is complex with almonds coconut soft leather tropical fruits and stewed black tea. Hints of brine and peat appear. The palate is rounded and rich with more tropical fruits sherry caramel pipe tobacco wood smoke and spicy tannins. The finish is relatively long and creamy with lingering smokiness. All the classic Springbank elements merge nicely here."
3760,6,"Terroir and provenance are keenly debated in many corners of the whisky world and Bruichladdich shows intense focus on the question with Islay Barley which uses only locally grown grain. The 2017 release was distilled in 2010 using Optic and Oxbridge barley varieties grown on eight Islay family farms and matured in a combination of French oak and bourbon casks. In addition to Islay Barley’s ambitious pursuit of true single-origin whisky this is a real gem for its ginger and tobacco aromas muscular mouthfeel and flavors of toffee spices and youthful oak. Number 9 in the 2017 Top 20"
3761,6,"Originally filled into 22 third-fill bourbon casks this 32 year old was re-casked into first-fill bourbon barrels in 2012 then finished in French oak wine barrels. Fresh peaches on the nose with vanilla fudge honey and ginger. Fruity and spicy on the luscious palate with orange cinnamon and coconut. Long in the finish with ever-present fruitiness plus prickly chili notes. (4200 bottles)"
3762,1,"Rich gold. Superb mature nose with subtle whisky rancio mixing fragrant mango with a little mint rosewater and waxiness; there’s even some custard and a whiff of woodsmoke before sandalwood brings back the exotic edge. The palate is delicate with an amazingly fresh acidity that becomes herbal (basil and tarragon). It’s late summer when there’s a sense of the year turning and you allow fond memories to gently wash over you. £7800"
3763,2,"A whiff of peat and a maritime breeze of salt air seashells and beach bonfire embers drifting into tropical notes of lime and pineapple as well as baked apples. Sweetness on the palate with a dash of peat atop vanilla cream graham cracker milk chocolate zesty lime and espresso beans. Water brings out fruit notes of melon strawberries and red apples and the finish settles things with a back note of cocoa and a bang of winter spice. (Editors' Choice)"
3764,6,"This was initially matured in American oak bourbon barrels then spent 7 years in 30 year old Matusalem sherry butts before 2 years of finishing in first-fill bourbon casks. The nose yields orange marmalade wood resin toasted brioche and cocktail cherries. Apricot fruitiness on the early palate then vanilla ginger and treacle. The finish is medium in length with orange peel fennel and gentle spices. (750 bottles)"
3765,6,"This was previously exclusive to Travel Retail but is now available in the U.S. Cereal and succulent tropical fruits on the nose plus Craigellachie’s signature sulfur along with cloves and polished oak. Toffee and orchard fruits on the muscular palate with oatmeal and a mineral quality. The finish is long and yields another whiff of sulfur lemon and a hint of mint. A quirky dram of true quality. (1700 bottles)"
3766,6,"Matured in one-third first-fill  European oak sherry butts and  two-thirds refill sherry butts. Rich  sherry notes on the nose with vanilla sultanas raisins cherry blossom and  a hint of new leather. Initially smooth  and very sweet orchard fruits on the palate with cherry liqueur turning to black tea and fennel. Drying very slowly  in the lingering finish with spicy oak. (6000 bottles)"
3767,6,"Classic ‘southern shores’ Islay from the onset: salty and medicinal on the nose with smoked haddock citrus fruits and milk chocolate. The palate yields full-on hot peat pipe tobacco black coffee licorice and more chocolate. The finish is long and malty with sweet smoke. Non-chill filtered."
3768,6,"This expression offers an uncompromising note of brine-laden peat and iodine with charcoal and sweeter fruit notes also present. The palate is equally out there with old-fashioned fabric Band-Aids bladderwrack seaweed black pepper smoldering peat vanilla caramel and sweet oak. The finish is as big as everything else with barbecue iodine and asphalt. Still a classic!"
3769,12,"No doubt about the sherry finish here: Toblerone brown sugar raisins Fig Newtons and hazelnuts on the nose along with a hint of sulfur. The palate is oak-driven and chocolaty with dried figs raisins cherries blueberries candied ginger cloves black pepper and almonds. A supple moreish finish with dark chocolate and lengthy polished oak. From the same undisclosed distillery as Kirkland’s 18 year old. (Costco)"
3770,2,"Orange peel and black tea greet the nose on this mellow ultra-aged expression and lead to delicate notes of raisin strawberry coulis and a whiff of incense and light peat. An overlay of muted spice and peat hovers above the palate which offers orange marmalade cooked red berries and chocolate eclair punctuated on the finish by an appealing cigar ash note. Dessert and a fine stogie rolled into one. (Collectible)"
3771,6,"This second annual limited release was matured in a combination of first-fill European oak sherry butts and refill sherry butts. Spicy orange marmalade on the nose with plums dipped in honey warm leather polished oak and cinnamon. The palate is oily with dark sherry cocktail cherries ginger espresso and sweet oak. Lengthy in the finish; spicy with dried fruits. (5200 bottles)"
3772,9,"The second in a series of three high-strength limited edition Highland Park whiskies and a rather bold expression. Nicely sherried and noticeably smoky — more than a standard Highland Park. Quite spicy too — with cinnamon but also ginger and nutmeg. Throw in some toffee apple Cointreau and waxed fruit for intrigue. Long sherried smoky finish. A very exciting whisky. (Not available in the U.S.)£85"
3773,9,"Aged in a first-fill sherry butt. Soft sherry notes gentle toffee golden raisin green tea with honey a peppering of spice (cinnamon red and black licorice candied ginger hint of coconut macaroon and brine) and undertones of juicy oak (especially on the finish). Tame somewhat seductive and well-rounded. Not overly oaked and I’m not finding any off notes. A lovely whisky but not quite as dynamic as the “classic” Springbanks I’ve tasted from the 60s."
3774,6,"The second release from Glenmorangie’s Bond House No. 1 Collection this 27 year old includes whisky from a parcel of casks that received a period of secondary maturation in Côte-Rôtie red wine casks. Honey and nectarines on the nose plus ginger icing sugar and damp heather. A silky palate delivery of peaches in cream apple crumble nutmeg and white pepper. The finish is lengthy with lingering spicy orange notes."
3775,9,"This whisky packs a lot of clean complex and well-balanced flavors. It features a creamy layered malty-sweet foundation (vanilla caramel toffee) chock full of bright fruit (golden raisin honeyed orchard fruit currant) rounded out by firm dried spice (cinnamon nutmeg mint) that dances on the palate. Long warming spicy finish. Nicely done!"
3776,6,"Matured in a mixture of first-fill American sherry hogsheads and refill sherry butts this is rich and fragrant on the nose with dark berries and marzipan then glacé cherries and wood polish. The palate is voluptuous with spicy dark fruit Christmas cake vanilla milk chocolate and a hint of dark rum. Dried fruits in the finish with raisins aniseed and soft oak. Finally plain chocolate. Superb! £375"
3777,6,"At 29 years old this single cask is one of the best releases to date from the Perthshire distillery. The nose offers geraniums honey almonds and toasted brioche while the palate is creamy with vanilla heather a fresh menthol note and green apples. Long and nutty in the finish with black pepper. Drying only slightly and spicy to the end—predominantly ginger. Beautifully balanced. (170 bottles) £295"
3778,9,"Antique gold relatively light in color compared to the rest of the Highland Parks reviewed here. Nicely rounded on the nose and palate and surprisingly youthful for such maturity. Mouth-coating texture. Quite fruity -- especially with some water -- with notes of honey-drenched citrus sultana key lime pie and melon. Caramel and bitter chocolate notes emerge with the chocolate and a wisp of smoke lingering on the finish. I could drink this all day and never tire of it. (Bottled for Virginia ABC)"
3779,6,"Following last year’s release of The Dark this parallel 17 year old cask-strength expression was matured in refill American oak. The nose yields vanilla oats ripe pears and mild wood-fire embers. Supple and initially sweet on the palate with icing sugar tangerines and developing darker spicier notes. Lengthy in the finish with spicy cedar oil. Proof that Highland Park doesn’t need sherry casks to be good. (4500 bottles for U.S.)"
3780,9,"Some of the best intensely smoky peaty Islay whiskies are balanced with a foundation of malty sweetness. This whisky is an excellent example. A sinewy malt with the classic bold notes of kiln smoke peat tarry rope and coal ash. Sweeter notes of honeyed malt ripe vanilla chocolate fudge and toasted marshmallow temper and sooth the palate along with background berry confit. The smoke lingers long on the palate. Ardbeg devotees will not be disappointed."
3781,12,"The nose has expressive peat with mineral and herbal rather than smoky characteristics; there’s also orange oil fresh ginger and chalk. Water brings out blueberries and blackberries. Nutty and roasted flavors dominate the palate with mouthwatering oak black pepper and coffee bean sprinkled with orange oil shoulder to shoulder with the peat. It finishes with savory ashy char: a whisky for the great outdoors. (216 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3782,1,"There are light oaked notes to start along with Oolong tea and very subtle smoke. These then shift into a mix of cedar and scented blossom. Classic layered elegance with the cask offering support not dominance. The fruits have that slightly eerie quality of decay while the palate is deep and juicy. This is an exemplary subtle old whisky with delicate rancio (it’s a little cognac-like) which is given a boost of extra life with a small drop of water. £94"
3783,6,"Glen Moray is celebrating its 120th anniversary with Mastery a vatting from 1978 1988 1994 1999 and 2001. Maturation—and finishing—has occurred in a mix of bourbon sherry madeira and port casks. Resinous sherry smoky red wine caramel and vanilla on the nose. Voluptuous on the palate with sherry succulent stewed fruit soft toffee and cocoa powder. Long in the gently spiced finish with port-soaked oak. (1000 bottles)"
3784,9,"Some of these old G&M Strathisla whiskies are quite lovely and this is one of them. It’s gently sherried soothingly oily in texture and complex with notes of maple syrup candied fruit plum roasted nuts polished leather and old oak along with some damp earth coffee bean cinnamon mint and subtle teasing kiln smoke. It’s soft rounded and still holds up nicely for a 44 year old whisky. If you like old sherried Speysiders that aren’t overly oaked or sherried you’ll like this one. If only it was bottled at 43% or 46% (or at natural cask strength if it was less than 43%). It would give the whisky a little more backbone and I might have bumped my rating up to the mid-90s."
3785,6,"This limited release was matured in 60% refill sherry butts and 40% fresh bourbon barrels. Initially sweet vanilla and ripe apple notes on the nose giving way to chimney soot and dry peat. The palate is very full and oily with honey and vanilla merging with smoked haddock charcuterie and more overt peat. Licorice coffee beans brine chili and peppery peat in the lengthy finish. (4500 bottles)"
3786,9,"A first-fill sherry cask bottling (one cask exclusive to North America). Some of the old Glenglassaugh whiskies can be very delicious and this is one of them. It's very clean lush and fruity (bramble citrus golden raisin) with a kiss of honey toffee and soft spice. Elegantly sherried; it’s never cloying. A very nice whisky from a quality cask that tastes more like 21 or 25 years old than 37. (I mean this in a good way.)"
3787,9,"Amber with gold streaks. Its aroma and flavor is fresh powerful and medicinal with notes of peat smoke band-aids tar rich toffee seaweed and brine. Thick in body with an almost molasses-like viscosity."
3788,12,"More complex than its pale hue suggests. The nose is sweet and malty: Honey Nut Cheerios butterscotch sliced green apple with caramel dip poached pear and a whiff of sweet pipe tobacco. Lively white pepper and grated ginger permeate milk chocolate-covered caramels toasted almond and savory cereals on the palate; there’s also fresh pear and apple and creamy vanilla. Almonds pipe tobacco dried orange zest cacao nibs and lingering restrained savory oak on the finish."
3789,6,"Aged in quarter casks bourbon barrels and sherry butts for 27 years then finished in sherry casks. Red apples and honey on the nose where the characteristic Laphroaig phenolic attack becomes muted with time. Dried fruit malt and vanilla on the palate along with subtle notes of iodine and warm tar. Developing brine dark chocolate and licorice leading into a dry smoky peppery finish."
3790,12,"This Quinta Ruban succeeds the 12 year old version adding two additional years of finishing in port casks while maintaining the same bargain price. The result is a symphony of understated opulence. Marzipan fresh apple and pear milk chocolate red berries candied ginger and praline on the nose build slowly leading into a fruity spiced palate. Flavors of soft gingerbread molasses cake cherry pie spiced plums almond nougat and dark chocolate intermingle with faint strains of pipe tobacco. It sings on the finish with a parting crescendo of hazelnut spice cigar wrapper and lengthy oak. Number 9 in the 2019 Top 20"
3791,12,"Impeccable balance from start to finish; clean and structured. The nose is floral and fresh with jasmine freesia and apple blossom plus green pears lemon talcum powder and almond cream. Lemon coconut and vanilla form a sweet bright palate that revels in its celebration of malt: Think of apricot jam in a shortbread thumbprint cookie. Sweet and clean finish with persistent lemon vanilla and mouthwatering oak."
3792,12,"An expressive yet delicate nose of honeyed toasted cereals peach jam hibiscus fresh kiwi and almonds gives way to fresh tropical and citrus fruit on the silky palate: mango kiwi pomelo grapefruit and mandarin orange all overlaid on a soft base of malt sprinkled with peppery spice. Coffee nutty malt polished oak and tinges of tropical fruit on the medium-length finish."
3793,2,"The 2019 edition of Laphroaig’s annual Càirdeas series this is a cask-strength version of Laphroaig Triple Wood. The complex nose is redolent of iodine lime peat smoke wood-fired meats drying seaweed salt air and other maritime notes. Charred smoky peat and coal fire envelop the palate and embrace emerging notes of bitter chocolate licorice savory herbs smoked jerky cracked pepper and cigar ash. A spicy finish is filled with leather bitter nuttiness dark chocolate espresso and lingering peat smoke. Number 12 in the 2019 Top 20"
3794,2,"Part of the Game of Thrones collection this pop culture mash-up whisky represents House Greyjoy and features its kraken sigil on the label. The whisky sings of the sea as blasts of ocean spray sea salt wet sand and seashells swirl above undernotes of peach cranberry citrus fruits and blackberry tart. The mouth fills with bonfire smoke light peat toffee black cherry and peppercorn. The addition of water coaxes out chocolate light black pepper notes and citrus. A flourish of allspice bitter chocolate more toffee espresso and almond on the finish. Number 13 in the 2019 Top 20"
3795,9,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Honey gold Aroma: Subtly complex. Floral (especially roses). Honeyed vanilla sweetness. Subtle notes of bourbon and bakers chocolate. Murray McDavid (distilled at Linkwood 1973 46%) cont. Palate: Nicely balanced and with great depth. Again the honey and vanilla which marries beautifully with the floral herbal subtly fruity notes. Almonds and dried spice on the finish."
3796,9,"A seductive Dalmore. Very fruity too with Seville orange peaches in syrup clementine pineapple and bramble. Sugared almond powdered vanilla ginger and lush sherry on the finish add depth and dimension. Consistent on the nose and palate and with great balance. I’m glad they stopped the amoroso finishing when they did. I feel that any more sherry influence here would have been counterproductive. Very lovely!"
3797,9,"A special bottling to celebrate a major distillery expansion in 2010. So nice to see this whisky bottled at cask strength and not chill-filtered. Silky smooth velvety texture. Creamy sweet foundation of vanilla fudge and caramel-coated almond. Plenty of fruit too (golden raisin honeyed peach ripe nectarine hint of banana bread). Richly textured good weight (but not cloying) and the flavors combine seamlessly. A celebratory whisky indeed."
3798,9,"This is the heavily peated expression of BenRiach. (BenRiach does not differentiate their peated expressions with a different name as Springbank does with Longrow or Tobermory with Ledaig.) It’s also finished with the dark lush “PX” sherry. Both influences are very evident with the deep heavy earthy smoky notes complemented by dark fleshy dried fruit. I think the two different influences marry very nicely here and I really enjoy drinking it. (Bottling at cask strength is a bonus!)"
3799,9,"Aged in a refill American oak cask. Quite lively for its age and the oak (surprisingly and happily) plays a supporting role rather than dominating. Creamy and mouth-coating with vanilla wafer coconut cream pie caramel nougat and bright fruit (sultana apricot tangerine and pineapple in syrup). Soothing finish. A very nice whisky. (Not available in the U.S.)£450"
3800,6,"This whisky spends 15 to 16 years in bourbon barrels before a final maturation in oloroso sherry casks. The nose is sweet with tropical fruits nutty spices almonds orange marmalade and worn leather. The orange theme continues on the luscious lively palate with spicy toffee cinnamon vanilla and honey. Drying and lightly spiced in the finish. A dram that deserves to be better known. Editors’ Choice"
3801,6,"The oldest single malt ever released by Glen Scotia was distilled on December 23 1973 and aged initially in refill bourbon casks before a final seven years in first-fill bourbon barrels. Oily on the nose maritime with burlap resin ginger and a developing fragrant note. Viscous and sweet on the palate with honey and canned pineapple. The very long finish embraces fruity resin salt ginger and drying oak. (150 bottles) (£3795)"
3802,9,"This single cask bottling of Scapa is a beauty! Brilliant gold color. Clean and fresh on the nose and palate with complex bright fruit (peach tangerine golden delicious apple honeydew melon pineapple) spice (cinnamon vanilla subtle cocoa) appetizing brine and beach pebbles all on a bed of creamy squeaky-clean honeyed malt. Dynamic appetizing briny dried spice finish. A delicious superbly balanced whisky that makes a great aperitif but I could drink this any time. (Bottled exclusively for D&M Aficionado’s Club.)"
3803,6,"A 23 year old expression that was maturated in American oak and a small number of sherry casks before a finish for up to 6 months in French cuvée wine casks. Canned apricots in syrup toasted marshmallows apple blossom and honey on the nose. Pears vanilla freshly sawn timber warm white bread caramel cloves and milk chocolate on the relatively full palate. Toffee and instant coffee in the lingering finish."
3804,6,"Ardbeg’s 2020 limited-edition cask-strength Committee Release was matured mainly
in pinot noir red wine casks from New Zealand a country notable for its sheep like
Islay. Woodsmoke on the nose with coal fires cedar and canned fruit cocktail in a
mild antiseptic solution. Supple and sweet on the palate with orchard fruits and an
emerging wave of peppery prickly peat smoke. Long in the sooty finish. Lively with
chile paste."
3805,1,"Quite earthy with orris root burlap and dunnage warehouse notes.  Distinctly meaty—Bovril (beef stock)—then cedary. This untamed edge—think Mortlach or Benrinnes—dominates the palate but the cask (a refill butt) isn’t overstating its presence. There’s espresso on the finish. Here’s Glenfarclas taking a ramble on the wild side. If your preference is for more robust styles then look no further. £345"
3807,6,"The first Batch Strength expression of Tamdhu appeared in 2015 and was also matured entirely in sherry casks and not chill filtered. Big sweet sherry notes on the nose with vanilla sultanas maraschino cherries and Turkish Delight. Rich and full-bodied with oloroso sherry milk chocolate vanilla dates ripe cherries sweet oak and allspice. The finish is sweet and long with lingering lively spices. A very quaffable well-priced dram for sherry bomb lovers."
3808,9,"Mahogany color. Medium to full in body and rich. Aroma and flavors are very reminiscent of the ""Black Bowmore"" releases: burnt fruit roasted nuts fruit cake polished leather wood resin and just a teasing of smoke. There is a harmonious balance between the dry oak spices and the sweet fruity oloroso sherry notes. Soothing finish. This whisky was distilled around the same time-and is very similar in flavor profile-as the legendary ""Black Bowmore"" whiskies released several years ago. Comparing this release with the Black Bowmore is only natural. Having tried this whisky next to the previous Black Bowmores I can happily say that this whisky is as good as they are (although a lot more expensive). While the original Black Bowmore whiskies are a little bigger and fuller in body (especially towards the finish) this new 1964 Vintage is a tad softer sweeter more rounded and more seductive. This is a very contemplative whisky-the more attention you devote to it the more pleasure it gives you. 300 bottles."
3809,9,"Solid amber color. Flavors are seamless silky smooth and rich with notes of dried fruit and flowers toffee subtle spices and delicate nuts. A great after dinner malt but universal enough to drink anytime."
3810,10,"Here’s an accomplished Macallan not a leather-lashed first-fill but the nose is still replete with prominent sherry notes accompanied by marzipan ripe mango apricot violin rosin wood spices and dried lavender. This has a beautiful weight with sweet candied orange and active spices. As tropical fruits appear there is chocolate clove pepper and a slight nuttiness with vanilla and baked fruits on the finish."
3811,6,"Sweet peat smoke and heather on the nose with light ginger and smoked fish drizzled
with lemon. Oily and rounded on the palate with more sweet peat lemon and sea
salt. Very long in the slightly waxy finish with peat and licorice. Price is for entire
Prima & Ultima Collection of which this whisky is a part. (1013 bottles) £20000"
3812,9,"Deep amber color. Complex aromas of lush fruit (orange lemon red currant) and oak spices (cinnamon clove and licorice). Rich silky body. Great balance and depth of flavor with complex fruit and wood spices similar to its aroma all wrapped in toffee and vanilla fudge. Very long evolving and satisfying finish."
3813,9,"Deep amber color with crimson hues. Incredibly rich aromas of fruitcake toffee dates roasted nuts with a hint of cocoa powder and other spices. Rich and thick in body. On the palate there are evolving notes of chewy toffee ripe fruit (oranges golden raisons) chocolate covered nuts multigrain toast and polished oak. Long soothing finish."
3814,9,"This is my favorite of the three. For about $20 more you get a richer much more complex whisky than the 10 year old and it is more balanced than the 21 year old. This 15 is drier than the 10 with lovely floral and spice notes (cinnamon coriander dried orange peel lavender rose) balanced by honey-laced complex fruit and a dry dark chocolate/orange marmalade finish."
3815,6,"Fresh fruits and white pepper on the nose with brine and rock pools. Very little
smokiness. The palate is also fruit forward—ripe red apples and pears—with barley
sugar. The peat is now much more apparent along with prickly spice. Mildly
medicinal. Salt and black pepper in the long finish. Price is for entire Prima & Ultima
Collection of which this whisky is a part. (721 bottles) £20000"
3816,4,"This isn’t quite a distillery-only bottling so much as a bottle only available at the distillery — which isn’t exactly the same thing. Bottled more than 10 years ago to mark the distillery’s centenary incredibly a small amount is still available and it is well worth pursuing.
Until relatively recently Ardmore was an industry secret cherished by those in the know. But the peaty and feisty no-age-statement Ardmore Traditional has introduced the malt to a new generation of drinkers and last year’s sweet and fruity 25 year old suggested that the distillery has a potentially diverse range of future treasures to be excited about. This bottling is light soft sweet and juicy. Orange flavors and peat team up to steer a middle way for what is a delicious and highly more-ish malt. Its only flaw is in the finish which dies away too quickly for this palate. Perhaps a slightly higher strength would have improved it. No matter it’s like the fade out of the guitar solo at the end of your favorite track; it’s a bit frustrating because you want it to go on and on but it doesn’t stop you going back and listening to it all again."
3817,6,"This 27 year old Talisker has been aged in refill American oak casks and the nose offers brine wood smoke wet tarry rope slightly medicinal with the emergence of milk chocolate. Big-bodied with lots of peat accompanied by chili and smoked bacon with sweeter notes of malt fudge and apple. A hint of fabric Elastoplast. Long in the finish with rock pools bonfire ash and sweet tingling spice notes which carry to the very end. A powerful beast even by Talisker standards. (3000 bottles)."
3818,6,"This is comprised of whisky aged in a bourbon barrel a 30 year old Matusalem sherry butt and a Colheita port pipe. Figs and malt on the early nose; resinous with tangerines vanilla and soft leather. Slightly thin on the palate but very smooth with spiced orange dates and coffee grounds. Dries very slowly in the finish with persistent orange a sprinkling of black pepper and a suggestion of mouth-drying oak. (1000 bottles per year for five years)"
3819,6,"The first release in Glenmorangie’s new Vintage Collection named Bond House No.1 after the 19th century warehouse that became the distillery’s new stillhouse in 1990. Matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Mandarins honey and vanilla on the floral nose. Very smooth on the palate with malt vanilla more honey and milk chocolate orange. Attractive soft oak notes and gentle herbal spice in the medium to long finish."
3820,6,"This was first matured in bourbon barrels then in quarter casks and finally in European oak oloroso casks. The nose is rich with iodine-soaked peat barbecued meat almonds toffee vanilla and orange. More peat then orange on the palate with cigar smoke dried fruits cloves and sea salt. The finish is lengthy and spicy with orange peel and dark chocolate. (Individual reviewer rating: 93)"
3821,9,"From a sherry cask. Bright and lively. Quite fruity with notes of golden raisin pineapple nectarine and tangerine. The fruit is balanced by honeyed malt and light caramel. A dusting of vanilla cinnamon and hint of cocoa with black licorice on the finish. Lush and mouth-coating. The best of the Aberfeldy whiskies I’ve tasted to date. (New Hampshire only)"
3822,6,"Glengoyne 35 year old has been aged in sherry casks and just 500 decanters have been released. The nose offers sweet sherry maraschino cherries honey sponge cake marzipan and soft fudge turning to caramel in time with a whiff of worn leather. Slick in the mouth with spicy dried fruit and more marzipan and cherries. Long in the finish with plain chocolate cherry liqueur; still spicy. Finally a buttery bourbon-like note. No negative cask connotations in this well-balanced after-dinner dram."
3823,9,"Deep amber mahogany color. Very mature and well-balanced. Notes of maple syrup on pancakes roasted chestnuts dates pot still rum burnished leather maduro tobacco and subtle Moroccan spice. Soft stately finish. Older whiskies often show an exotic side to their personalities as they mellow out with age especially if the wood influence doesn’t dominate. This is a very nice example of the genre."
3824,1,"A vatting of selected casks located at Balvenie’s No. 24 warehouse in Dufftown this is made up of seven ex-bourbon casks and three butts whose ages range from 1967 to 1989 all of which are then ‘married’ in a large vat (aka a ‘tun’). There’s classic Balvenie honey along with macadamia pistachio and caramelized fruits. As it opens it shifts into a high-class gentleman’s cologne: musk and sandalwood with some mulberry to add depth. Elegant and magnificent. £165"
3825,6,"This Private Edition expression was made using a strain of yeast found growing on local barley. It was aged for approximately 8 years in mostly second-fill and refill bourbon casks. Barley sugar and honey on the nose followed by lily of the valley lavender and white pepper. Big gingery fruit notes on the palate; fresh-squeezed orange juice vanilla and black pepper. The finish is long and attractively earthy. Editors' Choice"
3826,9,"This is a five year old expression of the more highly peated Bruichladdich whisky being referred to as Port Charlotte (named after the now-silent distillery down the road from Bruichladdich). More highly peated indeed. If you like your smoky Islay whiskies young and masculine this one is for you. It’s like sticking your head in a peat-fired kiln. But there’s more to this whisky than massive smoke. There are underlying notes of kippers soot and tar. With further investigation there are spice notes of black pepper and black licorice stick. What really makes this whisky multi-dimensional and balanced is its sweet underbelly of thick toffee jammy fruit and almond butter. Youthful but not immature."
3827,1,"A classic mature ‘Fiddich nose that mix of chocolate sweet fruits and funkiness. Dried apples a little currant but also a pure thread of sweetness. In time a little fresh mushroom. Complex. Soft on the tongue so you need to concentrate on what’s happening. Later becomes minty with supple tannins and a little artichoke on the finish. Water needs to be handled carefully to bring out green herbal notes. I’d probably keep water on the side. Excellent. (Travel Retail only) £250"
3828,9,"I wish the owners of Strathisla would put out older expressions of their whisky and here’s why. Layers of sweetness (caramel in particular but also honey and toffee) dovetail beautifully with an array of lush fruit (orange apricot golden raisin fruit gumdrops). All this is underpinned by subtle dried spice (cinnamon cool mint nutmeg) and teasing oak resin on the finish. What’s most impressive here isn’t the laundry list of flavors (although they certainly are there) but rather the balance. This and its lovely depth with no signs of lethargy. Impressive!"
3829,6,"The oily nose yields intense tropical fruits vanilla nougat and pine. Rich peach notes on the full palate with a light sprinkling of white pepper and hazelnuts dipped in milk chocolate. Spicy in the medium-length finish. Matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. (7056 bottles)"
3830,9,"Rich deep and muscular on the nose and palate -- and very polished. Notes of caramel/butterscotch-coated citrus (lemon Clementine) honeyed tropical fruit (coconut pineapple) peaches and cream creamy vanilla and ripe barley along with more subtle smoke cut grass and ginger. Firm dry resinous grip on the finish keeps all the sweetness in check. Rather expensive for its age but not for its quality. Very impressive for a 12 year old! (Available only at the Highland Park distillery their on-line shop and in Scandinavia.) £65"
3831,6,"This has a significant proportion of sherry wood and it marks a real step up from its younger stablemates. It boasts a stylish nose of old leathery cigar boxes vanilla and orange marmalade. Syrupy on the palate with oranges sweet sherry honey and figs. Spicy oak caramel citrus fruits and aniseed in the lengthy finish."
3832,6,"Like previous releases this was matured in sherry-seasoned oak casks. Jaffa oranges cloves cinnamon ginger and dried fruits on the nose plus warm leather. The palate is rich and spicy with more orange vanilla and burning logs. Smoky sherry ginger dried fruits and seasoned oak in the  full finish."
3833,9,"We’re drinking liquid history here. Antique gold color. Aromas of dried citrus lemongrass and ginger with background honeyed vanilla dried herb bouquet of roses and a wisp of smoke. Very long and evolving on the palate going from sweet to dry: vanilla custard crème brulee white chocolate candied citrus juicy oak polished leather dried tobacco and then resinous oak with teasing dry roasted nuts and hint of peat bog throughout. Long dry resinous finish. Remarkably well-maintained for its age. I can tell that it’s an old whisky but it shows good complexity. It’s not tired and excessively oaked.
When compared to the 30 year old and 40 year old expressions it’s actually more vibrant and youthful than the 40 sample I have. Yet it doesn’t have the deft balance and roundness which I consider a hallmark of the 30. Bottom line here: Anyone who can afford this whisky and actually drinks it will not be disappointed. It’s really nice. But for us regular folk try to pick up a 30 year old Glenfiddich if you can find one and you won’t go wrong with the whisky — or the price (relatively speaking that is)."
3834,6,"This expression is reputed to contain some whisky up to 40 years old and was matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. The nose offers overt sherry influences with fruit malt loaf maple syrup honey and old leather. Full and slightly oily on the rich palate with toffee raisins Brazil nuts and fresh cake mix. Dusty spices and oak in the relatively dry finish."
3835,9,"Richly textured with mouth-coating malt that is balanced by an array of lively fruit (fresh peach nectarine tangerine pears in honey and delicately caramelized pineapple). Creamy caramel crème brûlée anise and subtle toasted marshmallow add complexity as does its gently spicy pleasingly dry finish. Two years older than the standard 16 year old Nadurra (which I like for its vibrancy and freshness). This new Triumph 1991 is richer and more textured with more caramelized sugars riper barley and greater fruit impact. More mouth-coating too. (Exclusive to the U.S.)"
3888,9,"Deep gold color. Incredibly complex subtle aromas of vanilla honey marshmallow tropical fruit (pineapple peaches coconut) floral notes and a hint of almonds. Medium-full in body and firm. On the palate the flavors are complex and exhibit the same notes as the aroma starting out gently sweet but gradually becoming fruity and eventually drying out on the finish."
3836,9,"Amber color. Full aroma of peat smoke with interwoven notes of seaweed burning leaves leather and fudge. Medium in body with a slight oily texture. Powerful and evolving in flavor with great depth. It begins somewhat sweet up front with notes of vanilla and toffee followed by a peat smoke explosion. Lingering notes of seaweed oak salt and pepper add complexity. Finally the whisky becomes slightly sweet again with lingering smoke."
3837,9,"First things first — congratulations to the Grants of Glenfarclas on attaining their 175th anniversary. To celebrate they have vatted together a cask from 1952 with one each from the following five decades — and released it at an exceptionally reasonable price! The nose has a lift of struck match immediately followed by cedar pomegranate blackberry jam and Seville orange. There’s a thick caramel toffee sweetness to the palate alongside the classic ’Farclas depth where dried but sweet fruits repose. Recommended. £80 (Dave Broom) (Value Pick)"
3838,6,"This vintage bottling was distilled during the 1970s and spent 41 years in a refill bourbon hogshead (#3434). Spicy on the early nose with fresh oak. Increasingly malty with ginger and apricot. The palate is rich and full with Jaffa orange stewed apples cocoa and pipe tobacco. Plain chocolate and increasingly tannic oak in the finish. Ultimately warming spicy citrus fruits and smoky black pepper. (162 bottles) £1250"
3839,6,"Aged in a mix of American white oak barrels oloroso casks and cabernet sauvignon barriques. Sherry vanilla caramel ripe cherries and sultanas on the nose. The palate yields characteristic Dalmore orange plus brittle toffee bitter chocolate and cherry liqueur. Spicy licorice and soft oak in the finish."
3840,6,"Maturation took place in refill bourbon casks before a final 12-month period in first-fill bourbon casks. Lemon ginger pine resin and a hint of sea salt on the nose then banoffee pie develops. Luscious on the palate with subtle spice a touch of ashy smoke and principally big orchard fruit notes. Drying in the lengthy finish with a wisp of smoke brine and peppery oak. Glen Scotia at its characterful best.£250"
3841,6,"Six different cask finishes were used for this bottling. Fudge resin tropical fruit Seville oranges and milk chocolate on the nose. Supple and smooth on the palate; complex with red berries orange rind cream cinnamon and ginger. Long in the finish with nougat pepper and dark berry fruits."
3842,6,"Pipe tobacco white pepper and a mildly herbal note on the nose with emerging vanilla green berries and ginger. Full-bodied in the mouth supple and creamy with orchard fruits and more white pepper. Drying in the very long finish with chile light tannins and dark chocolate. (6978 bottles)"
3843,6,"The nose is rich with new leather sultanas dates furniture polish ginger Jaffa oranges and cloves. Silky on the palate mandarin oranges with cream developing toffee milky coffee and milk chocolate. The long finish offers nougat dark chocolate licorice and light spices."
3844,6,"The third release in Glenmorangie’s Bond House No.1 Collection spent 10 years in bourbon casks before being transferred into Bual madeira casks for 15 years of secondary maturation. Spicy nougat and ginger on the nose stewed apricots and a hint of bonfire smoke. Viscous on the palate juicy with strawberry liqueur chocolates. Spices linger long in the finish with damsons and dark chocolate. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
3845,12,"Restrained and refined the nose is bright with orange blossom honeysuckle peaches pineapple grapefruit almond and pistachio. The flavors are consistent tending toward sweetened fruit—candied grapefruit and orange peel grilled pineapple brown sugar-coated almonds—bound in a creamy length of silk. Polished oak offers a savory counterweight to the finish’s sweet-floral notes of citrus oil and rose water. One of the best entry-level single malts on the shelf. (Best Value)"
3846,6,"The 2018 Ardbeg Day limited-edition bottling includes a proportion of spirit matured in red wine casks which have been heavily charred leaving deep grooves in the surface of the oak. Fragrant soft smoke warm leather and salty red berries on the nose; background charcuterie. The palate offers red berry fruits vanilla dense peat smoke brine and asphalt. Beach bonfires and black pepper in the sweet finish."
3847,6,"This is the first of four bottlings in the Vault Edition series and was matured in bourbon barrels in the distillery’s famous No.1 Vaults. Nectarines in brine on the nose with iodine and sweet spices. Medium-bodied on the palate with peaches vanilla salt and slightly bitter orange. Lingering orange notes in the finish with cocoa powder and lots of salt. This expression lives up to its name!"
3848,6,"This is one of four new additions to the portfolio in 2018 and is the pick of the bunch. It is a ‘marrying-strength’ variant of the 18 year old relaunched in 2017. Treacle tart sweet woodsmoke and milky coffee on the robust nose. The palate is voluptuous with tangy orange malt and more woodsmoke. Milk chocolate and smoky Jaffa oranges in the finish. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
3849,12,"White peach juicy green pear vanilla and green tea meet the fresh aromas of clean sheets flapping on the clothesline in a crisp spring breeze. The palate is silky and light-bodied sweet with biscuity malt toasted almonds cantaloupe and milk chocolate; a few drops of water evoke oily sprays of lemon grapefruit and orange. Creamy and nutty on the finish sprinkled with toasted almonds bittersweet oak and a whiff of tobacco."
3850,9,"This replaces the 17 year old in the standard Bowmore portfolio. (The 17 year old will now be Duty Free Only). The difference is significant. This one is more sherried than the 17 year old and it wears the sherry well. I know that many of you like myself adore the 17 year old. Indeed I feel that the 17 year old displays the true essence of Bowmore. But this 18 year old integrates the sherry notes with the Bowmore signature to create a richly flavored Islay whisky experience. Thick toffee ripe fruit and tar-tinged smoke are accentuated by dark chocolate cocoa powder burnt raisin dates and sea salt. Long entertaining finish."
3851,6,"Aromas of newsprint damp foliage and wood spice dominate on the nose. Confident almost fizzy sherry notes on the full palate with sultanas figs and fruit spices. It becomes progressively more citric. The lengthy finish produces dark chocolate dipped in chili sauce. A sherry-soaked dram."
3852,1,"The follow-up to last year’s Ardbeg Day here’s the cult distillery in its funkiest
guise with a nose that’s reminiscent (I’d imagine) of a frontier trading post:
all pitch furs and gun oil. Some mint hangs around in the background
alongside eucalyptus. This is an earthy in-your-face Ardbeg with a hint of
box-fresh sneakers indicating some youthfulness. The mouth is thick and chewy:
wild mint oily depths and the slightly manic energy typical of Ardbeg’s young
years. Editor's Choice."
3889,1,"This is the bigger spicier and more complex of the pair (see below). A prickly start leads to heavy peat smoke pink and Szechuan peppercorns vanilla dark chocolate angelica then seaweed. The palate is oily with a detonation of gunpowdery peat licorice smoked eel and a feral edge that adds grunt. Layered and complex."
3853,1,"Although aged in refill then active hoggies and finally sherry there’s more smoke
than oak here a smoke like the aroma of a fire clinging to a tweed jacket. A
note akin to wilting spinach gives way to more conventional strawberries and
cream but always mixed with seashore breezes. This is Caol Ila in deep and
bold mood with green fig banana and a sweet center. Water gives greater
integration. You might (just) be able to get this. Do it. (distillery only) £99"
3854,6,"The nose is fragrant and floral featuring ginger hand-rolled tobacco vanilla hazelnuts and ultimately sweet sliced-apple aromas. Full-bodied in the mouth with stewed fruits milk chocolate raisins almonds and lively spices. The finish is leisurely with darkening milk chocolate tannic oak bitter tea and persistent spiciness."
3855,6,"This was matured entirely in sherry wood. Blackcurrants black pepper vanilla caramel and fruit spices on the nose. Supple on the malty palate with red berry fruits nutty sherry and almonds. The finish is spicy with black tea and firm oak."
3856,6,"Orange segments sprinkled with black pepper on the nose then spicy dark chocolate and coffee with cream. More dark chocolate and Jaffa orange on the palate plus walnuts almonds and marzipan. Lengthy in the finish with soft spices and continuing dark chocolate."
3857,6,"Distilled from Oxbridge and Publican barley varieties grown on six Islay farms. Lime brine oatmeal cookies and custard on the nose. Sweet barley apricots sultanas cloves and quite tannic oak on the palate. Malt and sea salt in the medium-length finish."
3858,6,"Sweet fruity peat new leather cinnamon and ginger on the nose. Good blend of smoke and sherry on the substantial palate with peppery red berries dark chocolate and peat. The long smoky finish features lively fruit spices. (1920 bottles in U.S.)"
3859,6,"Remarkably fresh and fruity on the opening nose then lively pineapple mango and peaches. Ashy woodsmoke lurks behind the fruit. Finally brine and black pepper. Vibrant orchard fruits on the palate with barbecue flavors that become peatier and spicier in time. Aniseed lemon tobacco and tangy oak in the lengthy finish. (3000 bottles for U.S. and Canada)"
3860,9,"Fresh and lively for its age with appetizing saltiness citrus fruit (lemon line and orange marmalade) and subtly complex dried spices. A fat malty foundation complements these seasonings beautifully mid-palate with the salt and dried spices emerging again on the finish. Very sophisticated."
3861,1,"Clearly Caol Ila; it’s the way that the oily smokiness seems to lean into the nose bearing with it wet oilskins a barely smoldering wood fire light seashore elements (drying crab shells) and very pure fruit which then opens to classic smoked ham aromas. Retronasally there’s a touch of green pea pod. The smokiness is more assertive than normal on the tongue with olive oil deep fruits and a pine-scented juniper note. Another belter. (The Whisky Exchange only) £155"
3862,6,"This represents House Greyjoy and features its kraken. The nose offers damp tweed sprinkled with black pepper plus smoky vanilla and ozone notes. Sweet smoke and citrus fruit on the palate then more overt peatiness comes to the fore with soft toffee. Medium in length through the finish with lingering toffee and light pepper. Great value! Editor's Choice"
3863,2,"Wet pine bough tobacco leaf tea light rancio and dark fruit aromas on the nose as the sherry cask lets you know it’s in the game. More pronounced sherry notes on the palate—chocolate brownies tiramisu and a hint of candle wax. Water unlocks chocolate baking spice and cinnamon bread. Smooth and creamy on a finish that adds drizzled caramel and honeyed almonds. Balanced sweetness and very smooth sipping—a treat for sherried scotch fans."
3864,9,"More polished and sophisticated than the comparably sweet and lush Lagavulin 21 year old also reviewed here. The pedro ximinez cask finish certainly gives as much as it takes away when compared to the benchmark 16 year old. An array of complex ripe fruit interwoven with notes of pot still rum toffee tar seaweed and brine on the finish. It seems logical to marry this big smoky Islay whisky with an equally big sweet fruity sherry. In this case the marriage works wonderfully."
3865,9,"Matured in a sherry cask. Lush with glazed citrus caramelized peach chewy toffee roasted nuts and subtle pine needles. The sherry is a driving force throughout this whisky but it’s obviously from a very clean polished European oak cask. Very delicious with a long satiating finish. Quite impressive for such a young whisky. My favorite of the bunch. (534 bottles) £300"
3866,6,"Part of the Rare Vintage range this was matured in first-fill sherry butts. Spicy sultanas and figs on the nose plus a menthol note. Fragrant old hessian. The palate is initially malty-sweet with sherried Christmas cake notes then plain chocolate and raisins emerge. The finish is long spicy and drying in a leisurely manner with the expected level of tannins for a whisky of this vintage.£620"
3867,6,"Matured in refill American oak casks that previously held peated whisky this 2006 distillate presents a nose of cider heather ginger malt hints of nutmeg and peat. Ripe red apples on the palate with honey vanilla fudge and a faint background wisp of smoke. Relatively long in the finish with that light smoke persisting alongside black pepper oak and now unripe apples. £85"
3868,9,"One of the finest Balvenie 15 year olds I’ve tasted. The flavors are clean well defined confident and beautifully balanced. Full malty foundation (with some ripe barley thrown in). Soft creamy vanilla honeycomb bright fruit (orange nectarine lemon peel hints of pineapple) with emerging dried vanilla coconut oak resin and subtle anise. Polished oak finish. It doesn’t have the depth that the classic older Balvenies have shown in the past but what it does have it has in spades. Beautiful! (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.)"
3869,6,"The third batch in this series comprises twelve sherry butts distilled between 1989 and 1992 eleven American oak hogsheads from 1989 and eight refill American oak butts distilled in 1992 and 1993. Rich sherry honey and malt notes on the nose with figs and citrus peel. Silky on the palate with Jaffa oranges raisins ginger and plain chocolate. Licorice sherry and spicy oak in the very long finish. (8850 bottles)"
3870,9,"A tribute to the Mackenzie Clan. Aged in bourbon barrels for 11 years and then aged an additional 6 years in port pipes creating a rich voluptuous robust Dalmore expression. Notes of toffee molasses caramelized nuts pancake batter fig cake and chocolate-covered citrus. Subtle glazed ginger and orange marmalade add complexity. Polished oak tobacco-tinged finish. Very dynamic and never sappy or cloying. Save this one for after dinner."
3871,6,"The first 15 year old release from Talisker this was matured in freshly charred American oak hogsheads. Marzipan damp tweed cooking chocolate and white pepper on the nose with light iodine and peat notes. Notably sweet on the palate with fleshy oranges peaches cocoa powder woodsmoke and peppery peat. The finish is medium to long with quite restrained Talisker pepperiness. £110"
3872,6,"Two parcels of single malt of differing ages from a Speyside distillery were blended to create this expression. The nose yields milk chocolate fudge slightly smoky apricot halves in syrup and clotted cream. Good mouthfeel with butterscotch and orange segments dipped in hot chocolate on the palate. The peppery finish features dark chocolate and bitter orange. (4446 bottles)"
3873,6,"As ever the composition of Black Art is a closely guarded secret and this is distiller Adam Hannett’s first such assembly. Rich aromas of fig succulent autumn berries sherry cream and malt feature on the complex floral nose. Viscous on the palate which opens dry with developing berry fruits and spicy oak plus dried fruits and candied peel. Long and drying in the finish with plum and peppery oak."
3874,12,"Charred oak meets grape jelly with aromas of crushed almonds dried blueberries new car leather dark chocolate-covered raisins and a whole lot of vanilla. In the mouth it’s chewy and well-textured; add water and it turns velvety. The water brings out better balance as well tempering the very active cask and buttressing berry orange cinnamon-chocolate and espresso bean. More coffee bean cinnamon-dusted pecans dark chocolate raspberry coulis and hints of tobacco on the finish. A scotch for bourbon lovers. (268 bottles; 90 for U.S.)"
3875,1,"Glen Grant’s new(ish) owner Campari is putting its money where its mouth is. Investment in plant wood and an impressive visitor center is slowly being backed up with a series of new releases. This venerable example comes from Gordon & MacPhail’s stocks but is an official bottling due out in time for Christmas. This is GG in relaxed avuncular mode: subtle woods amber Oolong tea anise. The palate is old apple fresh plum cream and ginger spiciness. £255(Available at the distillery in France and Travel Retail in Asia only.)"
3876,12,"Buckets of fresh-picked berries pastry cream green banana saline and iodine peat on the nose. It stays consistent on the palate with sweet berries toasted baking spice chocolate salty and mineral peat and a creamy texture. The flavor builds and then on the finish crescendos on a wave of dark chocolate bittersweet oak and smoldering peat smoke. The fruit doesn’t make it to the end but there’s no lack of a sense of completion. (1260 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3877,9,"Dark chestnut-copper color suggests a sherry cask and one nosing confirms it. A very multi-faceted whisky-the sherry is quite profound but there’s a lot going on in addition to the sherry. Deep succulent and chewy on the palate with fig cake raisins old rum tobacco pencil shavings and almond fudge. Quite a mouthful!"
3878,1,"Macallan’s 18 year old expression is for me the highlight of its regular sherried range. Deep amber in color. The nose is rich and heavily fruited: fruit cake mulberry a little moist gingerbread the bloody depths of molasses. On the palate dried fruits — more figgy than raisined — while the natural oiliness in the spirit balances the boisterous tannins from the European oak. A singed note on the finish (an extension of the molasses?) completes the picture. Balanced and complex."
3879,12,"Aromatic on the nose with vivid fruitiness mingling with briny rubbery peat: grilled apples and pears lemon zest and peach slices. On the palate it presents as simple but wait a beat to let the whisky settle—and add a bit of water—and that simplicity reads more as softness in texture. The flavors are expressive and consistent with the nose: lemon and lime zest peach apricot and salty-peppery peat. It finishes with bittersweet smoke tobacco leaf black pepper and lingering oak. (250 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3880,1,"With worm tubs and a fiendishly complex partial-triple distillation Mortlach has adhered to an old style of making whisky — and older richer darker flavors. Big and bold it is at its best in ex-sherry casks. The nose is meaty (think gravy/beef stock) with fig raisin and molasses. In the mouth it’s concentrated with good grip and a savory sweetness. A cult malt. £41 (Not available in the U.S.)"
3881,12,"Perfumy in both aroma and flavor: rose potpourri peach blossom lemon drops strawberry shortcake talcum powder and clean cereal notes on the nose. Candied rose petal on the palate as well as dried fruit (especially with water) rich and well-integrated spice cacao nibs and dry oak. It’s distinctive and well-balanced even when the oak seems a touch bitter. The finish is dry and leathery with pipe tobacco cinnamon and still that rose note. (172 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3882,1,"The soft fruit theme continues in this vatting of whiskies from you guessed it five decades of the distillery’s life. This has a heavy heady honey element alongside apple blossom and then peach and apricot pulp. There’s real complexity. The palate is lighter although still layered with some heat. With water there’s more apricot skin and some banana. Don’t overwater as it becomes a touch too tannic. You want that unctuous elegance. Highly recommended. £250"
3883,6,"Initially a fleeting aroma of farmyard followed by furniture polish spice apple peel and cocktail cherries. Smooth on the palate with dried fruit chewy oak raisins and more cocktail cherries. Spicy dark berries ginger and licorice in the finish."
3884,1,"This newbie from Balvenie is the worldwide replacement for the market-specific Tun 1401. A larger volume vat (8000 liters) is now being filled with an equally eclectic mix of casks (42 casks ranging from 1970 to 1992). Deep amber; this has substance but being Balvenie it’s gentle: orange blossom/Manuka honey edged with spice marmalade scented woods and a little frangipane. The palate shows a supple rippling power with some apricot cinnamon and root ginger. Awfully good. £230"
3885,1,"The question is how this stacks up against the Friends of the Classic Malts bottling one of my 2014 highlights. This shows mature distillery character with that discreet meaty undertow bedding down exuberant top notes: icing sugar on rhum baba preserved lime crystallized fruits honey pecan fig and scented woods. Typical of Cragganmore in its constantly shape-shifting character. The palate is concentrated orchard fruits dried fruits light spice chestnut puree and a little smoke. So yes in the same league. (3372 bottles)"
3886,6,"The first of five annual releases of Local Barley from Springbank. This practice revives a concept discontinued in 2001. The barley in question was grown at Low Machrimore Farm in the south of the Kintyre peninsula and was distilled in September 1999. Barley damp earth sea salt and citrus fruits on the lightly peated nose. The buttery palate yields spicy peat orchard fruits and more earthiness closing with smoky lemon."
3887,1,"Powerful and rich to begin with. Some raisin syrup backed with clean apple-like acidity adding some freshness. This swells into a deep but refined musky apple/pear note with some black fruits behind. Highly complex but full of distillery character. Water brings out a note like freshly-applied varnish. The palate is smooth gentle and deep. A classic mature Linkwood with all of the distillery character on show in perfect alliance with the cask."
3890,6,"The oldest of the fifteen expressions in Batch 16 of GlenDronach’s single cask release program this cask-strength offering has been matured for 26 years in a Pedro Ximénez sherry puncheon. The nose yields fresh-from-the-oven Christmas cake cherries nutmeg and sweet leather. Viscous on the palate with dark sherry raisins plain chocolate tangy orange and caramel. Prickly chili and dates in the long finish. (546 bottles) £310"
3891,6,"The first edition of Loch Gorm appeared in 2013 and it remains the distillery’s only whisky to be fully matured in sherry casks. The 2018 iteration comprises the contents of nineteen oloroso sherry butts filled in 2007 2008 and 2011 the oldest of which are some of the first sherry casks filled at Kilchoman. These rich confident aged whiskies converge in the best Loch Gorm to date showcasing the expression’s trademark blend of succulent sherry cooked fruits and earthy peat along with flavors of honey ginger sultanas and spice. Number 15 in the 2018 Top 20"
3892,6,"New for 2017 this was matured for 17 years in bourbon casks before being finished in oloroso sherry casks for 1 year. The nose is fragrant with prunes oranges vanilla and faint wood polish. Ultimately ozone. Silky palate delivery with sweet sherry honey and dark chocolate-coated orange fondant creams then a note of angelica. The finish offers spicy plain chocolate and a suggestion of sea salt. £86"
3893,6,"The ninth and final release in Diageo’s Game of Thrones series was aged in first-fill sherry-seasoned casks and finished in bourbon barrels. Vanilla and toffee plus spicy oak on the nose while the full sherried palate yields dry fruit spicy citrus notes almonds more vanilla and caramel. The leisurely finish presents wood spices and Jaffa oranges."
3894,6,"Dalmore launched a trio of vintages finished in tawny port pipes. The pick of the bunch is the oldest distilled in 1996 which displays a confident rich nose of raisins mildly smoky prunes vanilla and blood orange. Full-bodied in the mouth with red berry fruits ginger white pepper and spicy oak. Medium-length in the finish with coffee-soaked oak figs and damsons at the close. £450"
3895,6,"This limited edition 20 year old assemblage was matured in bourbon barrels sherry casks Cabernet Franc casks Cabernet Sauvignon casks and Pinot Noir barriques. Rich and sweet on the nose with marzipan apricot jam and fresh pineapple with vanilla custard. Silky with ginger cherries and caramel on the palate. The finish is long with black pepper licorice and slightly tannic oak. (5000 bottles) £120"
3896,6,"As with previous batches this was matured in a mix of Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry butts puncheons and quarter casks. The nose offers quite subtle sherry malt vanilla dark chocolate and black treacle. The palate is notably spicy with hot ginger black pepper cloves and cinnamon along with sherry cocktail cherries more dark chocolate and bitter coffee. Long oaky spicy and drying in the finish."
3897,1,"Only 60 bottles have been released from this 60 year old first-fill sherry cask. Amazingly the nose is not dominated by wood but is mature and concentrated with the aroma of rain-moistened tweed tropical fruit blonde tobacco cedar and chanterelle mushroom. This elegantly faded sepia-tinted impression continues on the tongue: fine-boned mossy clean and slowly drying. A classic example of oxidation not woodiness allowing freshness to be retained. Amazing. (The Whisky Exchange exclusive.) £6000"
3898,1,"Here we see a significant step-change from the progression of 13 to 19 (see below). Now there is added spice ripe fresh cooked and dried fruits and a touch of the peat smoke that used to be lightly added. With water a mix of maple syrup and waxiness comes through. Complex and deep. The palate remains thick and silky with melted white chocolate before lilies make an appearance alongside baked pineapple. Structured layered long and elegant. £337"
3899,1,"Deep amber. Generous sweet sherried nose; very ripe with dried orchard fruits chestnut puree and indeed chestnut honey then a little touch of meat and a pungency akin to Guyanan pot still rum. Sumptuous. As it opens there’s a fluxing mix of sticky toffee game pomegranate and dried red fruits. The palate is deeply savory with floor polish and cooked plums finishing with fragrant pepper. The cask has a huge say in things but the spirit copes. Excellent. £191"
3900,6,"This expression was distilled from barley harvested on Islay in 2007 and 2009 and combines whisky aged in 43 bourbon barrels. Sweet peat lemon juice and sea salt on the nose with honey vanilla and an herbal note. The palate opens with overt peatiness followed by brine and lemon plus vanilla and a hint of charcoal. Long in the finish with ashy peat and sea salt. (1440 bottles for U.S.)"
3901,1,"Apparently this is the final Supernova release and the Ardbeg team has ensured it goes out with all guns blazing. Although it seems calm initially—there’s a minty and sweet spicy element to the fore—the smoke begins to push through in the guise of creosote then sootiness which in turn mingles with seaweed aromas. The peat dominates the palate but there is sufficient oiliness to round it out and add layers of smoked fish and dried grasses. Farewell."
3902,6,"This is the fifth release of Ardbeg’s most heavily peated expression. The bold nose yields ashy peat fish oil hot lemon juice black pepper asphalt and antiseptic cream. Oily and voluptuous on the sweet palate with orchard fruits honey seaweed and lots of moist peat. The finish is lengthy and very smoky with chile cinnamon and barbecued meat."
3903,6,"The latest Balblair release is a 1995 vintage expression exclusive to global travel retail outlets. Matured in second-fill bourbon casks Balblair 1995 is non-chill filtered and naturally colored. Initially very fruity on the nose with peaches and carnations icing sugar on bonbons then a faint sprinkling of black pepper. Stewed fruits on the early palate full and confident with developing spices and brittle toffee. Relatively lengthy in the finish with dark chocolate and soft oak. Price is per 1 liter."
3904,9,"Soft soothing and gentle. Layered fruit (bright orchard fruit honeyed melon kiwi pineapple) polished oak and hay subtly spiced with vanilla bean milk chocolate evergreen and cotton candy. Bottled at peak maturity. Very more-ish too! (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
3905,6,"A great introduction to Bowmore’s single malts and one of the best 12 year old single malt scotches around. The nose offers tropical fruit sweet smoke a hint of brine new leather and floral notes. Peaches honey vanilla and more full-on smoke on the rounded palate. Brine cocoa powder citrus fruits and fading woodsmoke in the finish."
3906,6,"One of three Mortlachs introduced in 2018 this has much to live up to as the classic Flora & Fauna Mortlach was also 16 years old. The whisky has been aged entirely in sherry casks. The nose offers malt gingersnaps baked apple and a delicate savory note. Quite full-bodied with toffee apples gammon and old leather on the palate. Cocoa powder and tinned peaches in the finish.

3907,6,"The oldest bottling of Old Pulteney to date has been matured in American bourbon and Spanish sherry casks and was personally bottled by distillery manager Malcolm Waring. The nose of this highly accomplished veteran is fragrant and waxy with cooking apples milk chocolate orange Christmas spices vanilla and fudge. Initially the substantial palate offers spicy fresh fruits seasoned timber then a hint of brine with sultanas and plain chocolate. The finish is figgy gingery and sherried. £1490"
3908,6,"Dalmore released 8000 bottles of its latest 21 year old initially matured 10 years in American oak barrels before an 11 year period of secondary maturation in first-fill Matusalem oloroso sherry butts from Gonzalez Byass. Intense aromas of Jaffa orange marzipan and ginger plus soft oak. Robust yet stylish. Smooth and well-rounded on the palate with milky coffee orange marmalade cinnamon and developing spicy dark chocolate. The lengthy finish is spicy with licorice a hint of citrus and sweet oak."
3909,6,"Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series continues with this expression finished for up to 6 months in ice wine casks sourced from Peller Estates winery in Ontario Canada. Concentrated aromas of canned peaches in syrup vanilla and clotted cream. Silky on the palate with a carryover of peaches from the nose and succulent blood oranges. The finish is medium in length slowly drying but fruity to the end. (7800 bottles in U.S.)"
3910,6,"The first release from Ailsa Bay distillery is an NAS peated single malt. The new make spirit initially spends 6 to 9 months in 24 to 100-liter Hudson Baby Bourbon casks. It’s then transferred to virgin oak first-fill and refill American oak casks for several years. The ultimate vatting is non-chill filtered. A sweet smoky nose with almonds and walnuts leads into a palate featuring citrus fruit spicy peat and cereal notes with cocoa and soft oak in the finish. (UK and Nordic availability) £55"
3911,6,"This was matured in American oak sherry-seasoned casks. The nose offers cherry liqueur sultanas fruit spice honey and new leather. Vanilla and sweet orchard fruits on the early palate followed by darker berry fruits soft oak and a savory note. Cocoa powder and a wisp of smoke in the medium-length finish. (3150 bottles for U.S.)"
3912,9,"The most recent vintage from the 1980s. This whisky is very bright and lively. It dances on the palate with orange tangerine and lemon gum drops balanced by vanilla light caramel hint of anise and delicate oak. A whisky with great finesse and drinkability."
3913,9,"Aged in a bourbon hogshead allowing the distillery character to shine through. Fresh lively and inviting (especially for its age) with a complex array of tropical and summer fruit peppered with brine vanilla and a hint of baker’s chocolate. An oily texture adds weight. Dry deliciously appetizing finish. An excellent aperitif whisky but enjoyable anytime. (D & M Wines and Liquors exclusive.)"
3914,6,"This expression was distilled in December 1986 and filled into seven oloroso sherry butts. In 2012 the whisky was transferred to Pedro Ximénez butts for finishing. The nose yields sultanas figs old leather and white pepper. Very sweet fruit notes on the palate almost sugary with background rich sherry dates and treacle. Long and warming in the finish with a wisp of smoke and fruit spices. (4200 bottles)"
3915,1,"The first thing I wrote was “classic Kilchoman.” Then I paused…because it’s true. Though still young here’s a distillery that has established its own character. In this expression you get full integration between oak and distillery a sparkling mix of seashell and the freshness of seaweed touched with churned butter driftwood and fresh-kilned peat. On the tongue there’s samphire peat sweet barley and an herbal kick. This is Kilchoman coming of age assured and confident."
3916,6,"This bottling is from the oldest cask owned by Tullibardine distillery a sherry quarter cask (#341). An initial whiff of Cointreau on the nose then vanilla develops with marzipan white pepper linseed and old hessian. Finally musty sherry. A silky mouthfeel with drier sherry black currants dark spices and plain chocolate. Extraordinarily lingering with orange wine gums and spicy licorice. Despite 50 years of maturation in a relatively small sherry cask a whisky of great depth and quality has emerged. £16000"
3917,6,"Matured in a combination of oloroso sherry butts filled in 2008 and bourbon barrels filled in 2008 and 2009. The nose is initially flinty with lemongrass fabric Band-Aids fudge and vanilla. Ultimately the lemon is joined by Jaffa orange juice. Supple and sweet on the palate with developing nutmeg and white pepper. Peppery in the finish with plain chocolate and aromatic peat smoke. (840 bottles)"
3918,9,"Significantly darker than the rest well-balanced and palate-coating. Softer not as intense or as dry as the 30 year old. Creamier too with subtle yet exotic notes of tropical fruit and exotic spices. There is a point at which ultra-aged spirits -- whether they are whisky rum tequila or brandy -- find a common ground. What they lose in identity they gain in intrigue and layers of subtle complexity (if properly matured). This whisky fits into that category. Contemplative and ethereal in nature."
3919,9,"Very elegant and refined. Obviously this whisky was aged in a pristine sherry cask. The flavors are quite clean and well-defined. Gently sweet and fruity with golden raisin candy apple and red raspberry jam. There’s delicate pineapple dried cherry coconut and vanilla too with a polished oak finish. A very classy Glenfiddich. Not as bold and spicy as last year’s 1976 vintage (which I had a hand in selecting but ironically don’t like as much). This new vintage approaches the caliber of the 1973 Vintage release from two years ago which I still think is the best one in recent years."
3920,6,"Unpeated Caol Ila has become a staple in Diageo’s Special Releases program. This year’s expression was matured in a combination of refill and rejuvenated American oak barrels and bodega European oak butts. Fresh and spicy on the nose with tropical fruit aromas. Creamy on the palate with fruit-and-nut milk chocolate bars plus notes of developing citrus. The finish is slightly earthy with wood spices."
3921,6,"This 23 year old expression was released for the Ardbeg Committee. It includes whisky matured in sherry and bourbon casks. Sweet asphalt bonfire smoke lemon sponge drizzled in iodine and background cinnamon on the nose. Succulent sherried and chocolate-coated orchard fruits on the oily palate with vanilla and sweet peat. The peat dries slowly in the finish with developing licorice kippers and peppery oak"
3922,6,"This includes whiskies from nineteen oloroso sherry butts filled in 2007 2008 and 2011. Medium sherry orange marmalade cinnamon and developing sea salt on the nose. The palate yields more sherry earthy peat dark chocolate honey and ginger. Fruit spice sultanas and charcuterie in the medium to long finish. The best Loch Gorm to date. (15000 bottles)"
3924,6,"Distilled from Scottish barley this is the first permanent age-statement Port Charlotte bottling. First and second-fill American oak and French wine casks were used for aging. Rock pools lemon juice caramel but little overt peat on the nose. The palate boasts big orchard fruit notes smoky coconut and brine. Again the peat is quite muted. Long and spicy in the drying peaty finish."
3925,12,"Though the name means “rich and mellow” this whisky offers fresh clean aromas: honeysuckle and lilies; melon lemon and lime; hay and grass a sunlit meadow. Sweet and zingy on the palate with lemon oil guava candy blueberry strawberry gentle spice milk chocolate and walnuts. More spice on the finish with polished oak and dried fruit. Well constructed supple and easy to enjoy. (Total Wine & More)"
3926,12,"Honey Nut Cheerios pistachios pomegranate and softly spiced earthy aromas lead into a rich palate of juicy grapefruit guava salted dark chocolate and toasted nuts with biscuity and oaky flavors to round things out. Gentle but well balanced; no need to add water. (Total Wine & More)"
3927,2,"Sweet and beguiling smokiness with wild mint vanilla bean and chocolate-coated raspberries on a complex vibrant nose. The mouthfeel is thick and flavorful with warm notes of sweetened peat red berries and dark chocolate followed by a long velvety finish offering notes of orange tart more chocolate licorice dark espresso and a touch of wood-fired brisket. Lively agreeable and inviting—like the warm hearth of a mountain cabin at nightfall."
3928,6,"The first release from the new owners of Glenglassaugh distillery is obviously intended as a showpiece expression and it does not disappoint. Due in the States next year. Damp moss and cedar on the early nose. Sultanas candied orange maraschino cherries and sherry. Treacle notes in time. Spicy fruits figs brittle toffee sherry and ginger on the mellow yet robust palate. The finish is medium in length with allspice and old oak plus a wisp of tarry smoke. £245"
3929,6,"Arran’s latest addition to its core range is matured in bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. Mellow on the nose with baked apple and toffee then developing tropical fruits and icing sugar aromas in time. Sweet and balanced on the palate; spicy with milk chocolate and peaches in syrup. Lengthy in the finish with tangy fruit notes restrained oak and gentle spices. (9000 bottles)"
3930,12,"Fruit and grain drive this solid sipper with aromas of banana cantaloupe almond paste and lemon-ginger tea to start. In the mouth it’s rounded and full showing zingy lemon biscuity malt cooked bananas and milk chocolate. Water brings out brighter fruit flavors: strawberry lemon and green apple hard candies. The finish comes full circle with bananas lemon almonds and vanilla. (216 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3931,12,"At first whiff the nose is classic Islay peat: kelp and kippers with the rubbery pop of new vinyl couch cushions. Add a little water and fresh lemon and grapefruit burst from the glass: a welcome surprise. The oily palate highlights both—abundant saline peat and zippy citrus—with a tingle of white pepper that lingers in the nose well into the finish which also has roasted walnuts nori ash and oak. (192 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3932,1,"Sweet and sherried with plenty of sugar and toffee moving into plums and thick chestnut honey. Give it time however and a haunting note of dried mango and guava emerges followed by amontillado-style nuttiness and then beeswax polish. All in all just what you want from a gently-aged BenRiach. The palate may seem initially grippy but there’s such a massing of fruits that it copes well. Keep neat for maximum impact. Superb. £180"
3933,9,"Drier less toffee and fruit more dried spice and oak when compared to the standard Oban 14 year old.  A beautiful combination of rich nutty toffee balanced by polished oak salt pepper seaweed distant smoke and dried fruit.  Somewhat oily in texture.  Wonderful depth too!  An improvement on what is already the biggest-selling Diageo single malt scotch in the U.S.  Very exciting and dynamic.  (7700 bottles available only in the U.S. and at the Oban distillery)."
3934,9,"I feel this is by far the best whisky in the standard Auchentoshan portfolio and it is one of the best Auchentoshans ever released. It’s delicious nicely balanced and with lovely depth for a Lowland whisky. Baked muffins creamy vanilla honey and caramel blend nicely with delicate fruit notes (lemon red current strawberries). An impeccably balanced whisky. Similar to the 10 year old reviewed below but with greater depth and a drier finish."
3935,1,"Another first fill sherry butt giving its typical reddish-brown hue. This runs more into the clove cassia and allspice area than just dried fruit. While maturity is obvious and there’s even a hint of dunnage/leatheriness it is the concentrated fruit sweetness that surprises here. The distillery has fought back against the cask and while still crepuscular in nature there is a rich concentrated and mellow glow at its heart. £345"
3936,9,"Quite lively for 25 years with layers of bright fruit (lemon nectarine grapefruit pineapple) on a bed of vanilla and honey. There’s a peppering of dried spice smoldering ember and beach pebbles. Lightly smoky dried spice finish. Very nice. Brora enthusiasts will not be disappointed but the prices of the whisky from this shuttered distillery are creeping up."
3937,10,"There is a beautiful interplay between the lemon and sharp lime set against the bracing coastal nature of this dram. Gentle vanilla honey lemon zest and gooseberry compote waft from the glass. Vanilla frosting coconut macaroon bars malt drinks peach lemon and an undercurrent of pepper. Creamy chocolate once the spice subsides it ends with a fantastically chewy mouthfeel. Nuts pepper and cocoa make for a mouth-coating finish."
3938,6,"Staff members at Dalmore selected this distillery-exclusive bottling which has been drawn from American white oak cask number 446 and bottled at cask strength. The out-turn comprises 450 bottles. Refined polished oak on the nose. Honey marzipan caramel and vanilla. Fragrant with old leather and over-ripe oranges when water is added. Warm leather apricots orange marmalade cocoa powder and developing spice on the palate. A long spicy citric finish. Finally licorice. £150"
3939,9,"Deep amber color. Wonderfully complex and nicely balanced aroma and flavor of vanilla sweetness tarry rope oak toffee seaweed and brine. Medium to full in body and creamy in texture with a finish that doesn't quit."
3940,9,"The whisky begins sweet and creamy with notes of vanilla honey and ripe malt (reminiscent of a malting floor). Then the Laphroaig signature peat smoke seaweed tar and medicinal notes emerge. Bottling at 48% and without chill-filtering keeps the whisky from being dulled down. A whisky that is very dynamic. Nicely done."
3941,1,"Dark mahogany with ruby glints and a green rim. Lots of highly-polished oak as we move out of the woods and into a silent country estate. Wax polish and masses of whisky rancio. Sherry-soaked oak dry leaves currants and ripe blackberry. Highly concentrated but the fruits push their way through only lightly-resisting tannins. There’s a hint of smoke and Seville orange bitterness on the finish. My pick of the quartet. Excellent. 285 bottles."
3942,6,"This expression was distilled from Optic barley grown and malted (to 20ppm) at Kilchoman and matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. A whiff of smoke lemon curd vanilla and allspice on the nose. Supple in the mouth with baked apples sherry and fruity peat. Spicy dark chocolate and nutty oak on the finish. Richer and more rounded than previous editions thanks to sherry cask influence."
3943,12,"Brightness that brings to mind a spring day with aromas of jasmine and freesia blown about on the breeze fresh pear lemon wedge in sparkling water vanilla Cheerios and grandma’s potpourri. Fizzy lemon sparkles on the palate alongside pie crust vanilla toasted almonds jasmine tea green pear and savory oak and cacao; water emphasizes oily citrus. It finishes with zippy lemon pepper black and white cookie toasted almonds and hazelnuts and cacao nibs."
3944,12,"Heady aromas of Marshmallow Fluff coconut flakes Golden Delicious apple pistachio ice cream and fresh apricots yield to a soft malt-driven palate highlighting toasted coconut and almonds lemon curd Toblerone grapefruit oil dried ginger and savory tobacco. On the finish there’s a prickling of lemon zest and ginger in the nose and savory-sweet flavors of polished oak toasted nuts semi-sweet chocolate and a touch of tobacco. At the sweet spot of cask maturity and spirit character."
3945,12,"The rose-gold tint of this natural-color whisky serves as a visual hint of its heavy port cask influence. Dominated on the nose by butterscotch and caramelized sugar maple syrup pralines candied pecans dates and syrupy stewed plums. A silky but weighty palate revels in raspberry jam raisin bread semi-sweet chocolate toasted nuts dark sea-salt caramel and gentle spice concluding with a balanced finish of raspberry-dark chocolate squares tobacco and ginger."
3946,12,"Distilling with heirloom grains has become commonplace in the U.S. but much less so in Scotland. With this utterly unique single malt made from the historic Bere barley variety Bruichladdich reexamines whisky flavors starting with the raw material. Herbal pine bough salted almond and tropical fruit appear on the nose followed by a creamy mouthfeel with intense chocolate pepper citrus oil pine sap and perfumy chamomile flavors. The full round finish has rose petal white pepper and vanilla overlaying a delicate but pronounced structure. Number 15 in the 2019 Top 20"
3947,6,"Matured in oloroso sherry casks. Confident plum prune and raisin notes on the early nose with developing ripe cherries sherried fudge and resin. A slightly earthy undertone. Viscous in the mouth—very sweet—with developing tingling spices then darker fruit notes emerge with licorice and plain chocolate. The finish is long with enduring dark chocolate and fruity spice. (1180 bottles)"
3948,6,"This 39 year old was matured in a single refill American hogshead. Orange Jujubes on the early nose with vanilla honey and linseed. Big sweet soft fruit notes on the palate with pipe tobacco and a hint of background peat smoke. Aniseed and ginger develop along with the merest hint of old oak in the persistently fruity finish. £1250; Not available in the U.S. (225 bottles)"
3949,6,"Initially filled into an ex-bourbon cask then transferred into a Gonzales Byass oloroso ‘Matusalem’ sherry butt in 2005 for four years before a final two years in a freshly-emptied bourbon barrel. The nose is initially floral with overripe Seville oranges figs ginger and cocoa powder. Peaches and almonds on the palate before dark fruits and salted nuts appear. Drying oak is held at bay and the final note is fat and figgy. Cask number 14; 233 bottles."
3950,6,"This was produced from barley grown on the distillery’s Cadboll Estate and matured for 15 years in first-fill bourbon casks. Soft malt ginger honey tangerines and rose petals on the pleasing harmonious nose. Rounded on the palate with malt more honey white chocolate fudge and tangy citrus notes. Citrus fruit vanilla and cocoa powder on the finish."
3951,1,"A welcome return for Hart Brothers. This Glen Grant is light clean and penetrating with lots of gooseberry melon basil and cut grass. This turns into an intriguing note of concentrated fruits; think yellow wine gums and fresh William pear. The palate has classic Glen Grant purity with a hint of tropical fruits. Water adds another graceful layer on top making the effect more like a rose garden…one which you keep returning to. Excellent. £66"
3952,6,"Oily on the nose with spent matches resin and grilled meat then vanilla citrus fruit
old leather and a developing floral note. Initially very fruity on the muscular palate
with cracked pepper stewed root vegetables and dark chocolate appearing in time.
Peppery oak ginger and soy sauce in the finish. Price is for entire Prima & Ultima
Collection of which this whisky is a part. (389 bottles) £20000"
3953,6,"This is the ultimate PortWood expression from Balvenie and has been finished in 30 year old port pipes. A more vibrant and textured Travel Retail variant is non-chill filtered and bottled at 47.6%. Soft red grape notes vanilla and milk chocolate on the nutty nose. Very discreet smoke. Rich plum flavors in the mouth dark berries covered in cream and spicy honey. The finish is long and elegantly drying."
3954,6,"The oldest house bottling of Longmorn to date is non-chill filtered and lavishly presented in a purple casket which probably accounts for a chunk of the purchase price. The nose is classic Longmorn: soft and sweet majoring in honey hazelnuts caramel and milk chocolate while the creamy palate features orchard fruits ginger and allspice. The finish is lengthy and softly spiced with honey orange and sweet oak."
3955,9,"Amber chestnut color. Aromas of rich sherry ripe fruit toffee molasses peat smoke damp oak and nuts. Medium to full in body. Its flavors start out rich and sweet with sherried fruit toffee and dark chocolate. It then becomes drier with notes of peat smoked nuts seaweed and brine ultimately finishing with notes of spice bitter chocolate and smoky smoldering embers. This is a new bottling of Bowmore 25 year old and an improved one at that. It is richer fuller and more balanced than its predecessor. A wonderful dram indeed. The 17 year old was my favorite of the standard Bowmore line. Not anymore."
3956,1,"Pale and slightly flinty to start with touches of Caol lla-style salt-washed rocks but here there’s sweetness while the smoke gives it a mezcal-like air; pears and burning wood (hot brake pads) minerality then green olive and a light medicinal note. With water sashimi-style cleanliness. The palate is rounded with real olive oil peppery sweetness soot and white chocolate. A real ‘palate whisky’ filled with bare-faced bravado.  A great Ardbeg."
3957,9,"This replaces the 17 year old in the standard Bowmore portfolio. (The 17 year old will now be Duty Free Only.) The difference is significant. This one is more sherried than the 17 year old and it wears the sherry well. I know that many of you like myself adore the 17 year old. Indeed I feel that the 17 year old displays the true essence of Bowmore. But this 18 year old integrates the sherry notes with the Bowmore signature to create a richly flavored Islay whisky experience. Thick toffee ripe fruit and tar-tinged smoke are accentuated by dark chocolate cocoa powder burnt raisin dates and sea salt. Long entertaining finish."
3960,10,"Highly approachable at cask strength with lemon biscuits oak shavings kiwi vanilla essence and breezy maritime notes. The palate unpacks lemon meringue pie and green melon with an undercurrent of spice. Vanilla and caramel build atop a growing disquiet of peppery spice with hints of peppermint to finish. This works superbly as a drinking experience without diluting."
3961,4,"There’s something enigmatic and highly attractive about this distillery and its deceased brother Brora. Perhaps it’s the unpredictability; there are plenty of independent releases of varied and often questionable quality and you’re never quite sure what’s going to turn up. Even iconic expressions such as the 30 year olds can vary from quite sublime to appalling and sulfury when in the wrong hands.
When the malts from both distilleries are good though — and the official bottlings tend to be — they’re very very good. This Clynelish is a delightful surprise from the beginning its nose some way removed from the official 14 year old and more in common with some recent Diageo-release Broras mixing soft maritime notes with squiggly peat and some fruit notes. The palate is complex and attractive with savory peat sweet pineapple salt light fish drizzled lemon pepper chili and cardamom. It all makes for a big complex evolving (and grown up) whisky — and great value for the price tag."
3962,6,"After 12 years of waiting Francis Cuthbert has finally released the first bottling of his Daftmill Lowland single malt. The nose is soft and floral with peaches walnuts coconut warm caramel and milk chocolate. The palate features cereal almonds nougat and subtle citrus fruits. Drying in the relatively long finish with subtle oak. Well worth the wait! (629 bottles) £210"
3963,6,"Non-chill filtered and matured exclusively in bourbon casks. Very floral on the nose with toffee and spicy new leather. Soft and slightly smoky in the mouth with vanilla and spicy ripe pears.  A touch of licorice leads into a long slightly drying finish. (670 bottles)"
3964,6,"This 8 year old was distilled using Bere barley a low-yielding heritage strain grown on the Orkney Islands. Aromas of a damp cellar; oily nutty with cereal burlap and mild orchard fruit notes. The palate is persistently oily with pineapple honey nutmeg and white pepper. Drying in the finish with licorice coal and strong black tea. Proof that barley varieties can make a difference. (18000 bottles; individual reviewer rating: 92)"
3965,9,"A new line of Islay single malts from Specialty Drinks an extension of The Whisky Exchange. (The bottle doesn’t tell you which distillery this whisky came from but if you look at a map of Islay you can probably figure it out.) I like this expression better than the more expensive 25 year old. There’s impeccable balance and more vibrancy in this 17 year old with seaweed smoked Spanish olive coal soot pencil shavings citrus and anise along with subtle kipper and picked ginger. All this is layered on a bed of oily honeyed malt. Salty peppery sooty tarry finish. Nicely done! £50"
3966,9,"The 8th Private Edition release. This one is finished in sun-baked casks which previously contained Malmsey Madeira. A predominantly sweet and fruity whisky with caramel honeyed almonds peaches in syrup and orange scone. Soft soothing finish. Delicious!"
3967,1,"A vatting of three first-fill American oak casks for me this is the most lifted and effusive of the ongoing Cellar Collection range. The nose is full of aromas of anise blackcurrant leaf honeysuckle jasmine frangipani flowers and a subtle almond sweetness. The palate continues in similar vein with more spice and just sufficient oak to add distinct structure and a coconut character. Sublime. It won’t however be released in the U.S. £1000"
3968,6,"Glencraig was the name given to the single malt made using Lomond stills at Glenburgie Distillery. The nose leads with linseed oil then coconut malt dark chocolate fondant and tiramisu. Oily on the palate with sweet orange cocoa powder and ginger. The finish dries very slowly to dark chocolate and light wood spices. (110 bottles 12 for U.S.)"
3969,9,"Surprisingly fresh - sanguine even - for its age and appetizingly aromatic. Fairly light and approachable in body but always inspiring and pithy. Notes of fresh seabreeze brine teasing exotic spices and tangerine are softened by gently creamy malt notes and hints of coconut and almond. Very delicious and enjoyable anytime."
3970,9,"Bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered. Smart move! It really helps this whisky. This is a soft — almost elegant — Laphroaig (if that’s not an oxymoron). Very clean with honeyed malt ripe barley brine seaweed and peat smoke with just a teasing of the medicinal band-aid notes that Laphroaig is known for. The owner-bottled 18 year old which I rated a 90 is darker and drier with more oak on the finish. I like this Hart Brothers expression just a little better."
3971,6,"Aged in a mix of Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry-seasoned casks this has a peppery slightly savory nose offering boiled sweets and dried fruits. The palate is voluptuous with sherry dates caramel dark spices and oak tannins. Licorice and a suggestion of chile in the ultimately drying lengthy slightly meaty finish. (7692 bottles)"
3972,9,"A single cask from the distillery’s peated “Port Charlotte” line of whiskies. Well behaved for such youth. Nice honeyed malt and soft caramel base with good viscosity as a bed for tarry peat licorice stick freshly-ground pepper and cocoa along with a kiss of sauternes delicate pit fruit smoked seaweed and a lingering coastal accent. Long warming finish. (Park Avenue Liquor exclusive)"
3973,6,"This is a new recipe replacing the old 12 year old. Rounded and warming on the nose with stewed fruits orange peel and a hint of lime. Voluptuous in the mouth with honey milky coffee figs and dried fruit. Black currants licorice and lively spices in the finish. A really satisfying well-structured dram."
3974,9,"Very smooth for Laphroaig -- the extra aging has mellowed this whisky. Soothing honeyed malt creamy vanilla and toffee provide a bed for peat smoke charcoal and tar; along with more subtle brine smoked seaweed anise ginger and citrus. A gentler creamier more tactile less medicinal Laphroaig when compared to some of its siblings. Will you prefer the new 18 year old to the 15 year old it is replacing? That depends. I enjoy the balance and subtle complexity of flavors with the 15 year old but I also like the enhanced richness and mouth-coating creaminess of the 18. The higher strength (and no chill-filtering) of the 18 is certainly a bonus. (Side note: I know this is a moot point now but I would like to have seen the 15 year old bottled at 48% rather than 43%.)"
3975,6,"Matured in a mixture of oloroso sherry bourbon and virgin oak casks. Honey vanilla and tropical fruits on the spicy aromatic nose with just a hint of oak. The honey and vanilla carry over to the palate where they are joined by peaches drinking chocolate and subtle sherry. The finish dries steadily with long-lasting citrus fruit. A stylish complex dram."
3977,9,"There have been a lot of old heavily sherried independently bottled Glen Grant whiskies on the market over the past several years. This one appears to be from a refill sherry cask as its influence is more subtle. It has aged well showing no excessive oak but plenty of fruit (summer fruits dried citrus stewed fruits tangerine golden raisin) balanced by polished oak grape skin and subtle dark chocolate. Distinctively pleasing. Don’t add too much water though as it breaks down. (A Kensington Wine Market exclusive.) $500 (CAD)"
3978,6,"The third release in Macallan’s annual Edition series—which focuses on aspects of cask influence—was matured in a mix of European and American oak casks. Figs and apricot jam vanilla Jaffa oranges and cinnamon on the nose. The palate is silky and offers a big citrus fruit hit Bit-O-Honey then creamy milk chocolate. Milk chocolate persists through the long fruity finish with attendant sweet oak."
3979,9,"These Port Ellen whiskies are becoming increasingly rare since the distillery closed down for good in 1983. This is a very good example of an old-fashioned Islay whisky: never heavy but with lots of kick. There’s plenty of wet leaf bonfire smoke coal tar and some earthy damp kiln notes and brine. But you’ll discover a lovely honeyed maltiness for balance along with tangerine dirty martini and cocoa for complexity. Smoky briny finish. There will be a time when some of us will tell the next generation of whisky drinkers about the joys of Port Ellen. Mare sure you’re one of those telling the story not listening to it. (Exclusive to Kensington Wine Market.) $250 (Canadian)"
3980,9,"The seventh limited edition release of Port Ellen whiskies by Diageo. Not as vibrant and intense as younger bottlings (particularly on the nose) but nicely matured with a satisfying sweet foundation. Notes of toffee and roasted nuts permeate though the peat kiln smoke coal tar fish nets and charred oak. Seaweed and brine more reserved mid-palate emerges noticeably on the finish. The Port Ellen bottlings are getting older (the distillery closed in 1983) and they are getting more expensive. This one still captures the essence of Port Ellen."
3981,1,"So soon? This latest release of what is becoming a legendary series mixes nine casks—four butts five hoggies—from between 1966 and 1990. Hugely complex and obviously mature it is one to sit and smell forever. Marzipan mocha pain au chocolat manuka honey; every sniff reveals another aroma. It opens into cigar sandalwood citrus and ripe black fruits. The palate is equally layered and expansive. It takes water but only a drop for that density is all-important."
3982,6,"This limited edition bottling celebrates the 25th anniversary of the DoubleWood releases. DoubleWood malts are initially matured in bourbon casks before a second period in European oak sherry casks. Classic Balvenie honey orchard fruits toffee and oak on the nose. The palate is voluptuous with orange honey ginger and milk chocolate. Spicy sherry in the rich long finish. (3600 bottles)"
3983,1,"You would expect any 70 year old whisky to be crepuscular dense and wooded. Not here. The nose is amazingly fresh — distillery character fully intact — with layers of rancio and heavy florals. In time there’s candle wax vanilla milk chocolate and a touch of leather even the whiff of a soft mink stole. Concentrated and complex. The palate is like an ancient vin santo with oxidized nuttiness quince and medlar and subtle peat. Hugely expressive on the palate with a sweet finish. Truly remarkable."
3984,6,"This veteran expression was fully matured in first-fill sherry butts. Fragrant on the nose with black treacle prunes raisins lanolin bung cloths and polished oak. Big stewed fruit and warm leather notes on the palate soon reeled in by spicy tannic oak plus licorice and aniseed though a stubborn dusty fruitiness persists. The finish is lengthy and mouth-drying with lots of dark oak. A lovely example of its kind. £1575"
3985,6,"Matured in first-fill oloroso sherry casks this is 20% peated whisky from 1997 and 80% fruitier whisky distilled in 2001. Earthy on the early nose with bonfire smoke vanilla raisins and prunes. The palate opens with sweet fruit notes and medium-dry sherry giving way to nutmeg brine and peat. The finish features plain chocolate bitter lemons and a hint of smoky chili. £85"
3986,9,"Older expressions of this unpeated Islay dram are often quite delicious but they aren't easy to come by. The best ones like this one take the sweetish toffee/nutty foundation of younger expressions and add layers of depth and complexity. This whisky just continues to evolve on the palate. The entrance is creamy in texture with layers of sweetness (caramel vanilla fudge toffee) becoming nutty and marzipan-like with subtle background fruit. The finish is long and pleasingly dry with a hint of salt. Very entertaining and satisfying."
3987,6,"This replaces the 21 year old expression. Initially matured in bourbon and second-fill American oak casks and then in Spanish oak oloroso butts. Rich warming aromas of cinnamon honey oak and milk chocolate. The chocolate darkens on the full palate with contrasting ripe pears and crème brûlée. A hint of brine along with citrus fruits and light oak in the lengthy finish."
3988,9,"Nougat and dates to the fore then becoming increasingly nutty with suggestions of Demerara rum and cinnamon and underlying polished leather. Lovely dried spice notes and an appetizing salty tang teases the palate on the finish."
3989,6,"Highland Park 12 Year Old boasts individuality and complexity thanks in part to the use of Orcadian peat in the distillery floor maltings and the employment of ex-sherry casks for maturation. The nose is fragrant and floral with hints of heather and some spice. Smooth and honeyed on the palate with citrus fruits malt and distinctive tones of wood smoke in the warm lengthy slightly peaty finish."
3990,9,"Very fragrant on the nose and thick on the palate. The flavors are chock full of thick chewy toffee chocolate fudge roasted nuts burnt raisin black currant and spiced oak. There’s a hint of salt and Earl Grey tea on the finish. Very dynamic."
3991,1,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. A first-fill American oak hoggie was the receptacle for the representative from the 1960s. The cask has provided an extremely relaxed environment for maturation to take place with a return of the pineapple (grilled on a barbecue this time) along with linden blossom cream green jasmine tea and mint. The effect is like a grown up 1991. The maturity kicks in on the palate — thick and slow with some sandalwood alongside honeysuckle. Gentle and clean and again not one to dilute. £750"
3992,6,"Malted to 208 ppm and matured in a mix of virgin oak and first- and second-fill bourbon and Tennessee whiskey barrels. The nose is fragrant with pepper iodine intense peat smoke and lemon peel. Juicy orchard fruits and more smoke on the palate with treacle caramel and spice. Black tea licorice lingering woody peat and chile in the finish."
3993,6,"Released with no age statement Fettercairn Fior contains 15 percent heavily-peated whisky matured in first-fill ex-bourbon barrels along with a proportion of 14 and 15 year old spirit. The result is a bold and complex whisky with real nose presence; smoke sherry toffee vanilla and oranges merge on the nose while the palate showcases more smoke and toffee plus spices oak and licorice in the lengthy finish. £36 Not currently available in the U.S."
3994,6,"This latest vintage release from Glen Garioch is a cask strength 25 year old. It follows on from previous ‘small-batch’ 1978 1990 1991 and 1994 vintages. Peaches and ginger on the nose with fudge and a wisp of smoke. Mildly herbal. Full-bodied rich and sweet in the mouth. Fresh fruit and violet creams. Finally a slightly earthy peaty note. The finish is long and gently smoky. Robust yet refined."
3995,1,"Created by Dennis Malcolm to celebrate his half century at Glen Grant this uses casks
from each of his five decades. Pale it may be but this is no dainty little
thing. There’s lots of buttery oak before classic Glen Grant lift and energy
emerge: green apple fruit blossom William pear and yellow fruits; lemon
butter icing and nettles with water. The palate is vibrant and energetic but
holds to the middle of the tongue. A suitably celebratory dram.
Congratulations! £115"
3996,6,"The Dalmore spirit that comprises Ceti comes from a mix of bourbon and sherry casks with bourbon wood predominating. 23 years of maturation in American oak were followed by seven years in 30 year old Gonzalez Byass Matusalem oloroso sherry butts. The result is a nose of old leather hessian sandalwood vanilla plain chocolate and ripe Jaffa oranges. Very full-bodied with burnt orange pineapple and sticky toffee while the finish offers ginger orange wine gums and old oak. 1000 bottles. £1250"
3997,9,"Antique gold color. A pleasingly aromatic aroma of dried fruit floral notes malt and light toffee. Medium in body and slightly chewy. Its flavors are well-balanced deep and complex. Toffee almonds and sweet malt notes with interwoven notes of fruit. The palate ultimately dries out with dried fruit herbs and nuts on the finish."
3998,6,"Smoky sherry damp burlap lanolin then orange blossom on the nose with a hint of glass cleaner. The palate yields juicy damsons followed by aniseed bitter chocolate and oak tannins. Char and faint smoke in the extremely long finish. (50 bottles in U.S.)"
3999,9,"The aromas are tightly bound but a little water releases them nicely. A powerful dram with tarry leafy coal ash caramel apple and driftwood notes; even a little soapy (not necessarily a negative). More subtle floral notes (heather violet) Earl Grey tea and smoked fish. Long damp peat smoke and charcoal finish."
4000,6,"Molasses orange peel and prickly oak spices on the nose; herbal oily green notes develop. Finally more overt sherry. The palate is supple with sweet sherry and icing sugar notes plus Turkish Delight fruitcake and toffee. Ultimately cinnamon and dark chocolate. Cloves more dark chocolate and mouth-drying oak in the long finish."
4001,6,"Distilled in 1969 the oldest Bunnahabhain ever released was matured in second-fill sherry butts. The nose yields sweet resin marzipan ginger glacé cherries a hint of cloves and red berries. The silky palate features Jaffa oranges dark chocolate prunes and more glacé cherries. The finish dries steadily with slightly bitter tea white pepper a savory note and quite subtle oak tannins for a dram of this vintage. (198 bottles)"
4002,9,"Straw color. Fresh appetizing aroma. Light-medium body. Nicely balanced flavors. Both the aroma and palate express notes of spices (Dijon mustard) brine exotic peppers caramel and fruit. Lingering finish."
4003,9,"Matured in amoroso casks. The amoroso softens Talisker’s fiery personality and adds a gentle sweetness not normally found in Talisker. There’s a lot going on here-notes of toffee and dark chocolate layered with bitter orange seaweed kippers smoked nuts damp peat and kalamata olives finishing with a peppery glow. Not an every day dram-one has to be in the mood for a whisky like this. (With sausages during brunch perhaps?)"
4004,6,"Port Wood is a limited-edition 10 year old expression matured in Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry casks followed by a port pipe finish. Gingerbread figs dried apricot and honey on the nose. Viscous with sweet orange notes on the palate milk chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Hazelnuts cherry pie and sultanas in the medium-length finish."
4005,6,"This Perthshire single malt was distilled in 1993 and aged in European oak sherry butts. Brittle toffee black treacle aniseed black pepper and cigar boxes feature on the rich nose. The bold palate yields full creamy sherry notes almonds ginger old leather and a slightly savory tang. Long warming and peppery in the finish. (5514 bottles)"
4006,9,"Very dry fragrant and spicy. Medium bodied but firm. Initial flirtatious notes of honey creamy caramel and oatcakes quickly become dry and arid with a foundation of leather and oak shavings. The whisky is peppered throughout with notes of anise coffee dried herbs and undertones of Madeira. Very forward and bullishly dry for its age and more intense than the standard Cragganmore bottling. It’s rare for a whisky this young to be so complex."
4007,6,"A nose of bold sherry worn leather figs malt white pepper and ginger. Ultimately a mildly savory note. Full-bodied on the palate with overripe damsons and more ginger; spicy sherry and dried fruits develop. Medium to long in the finish with persistent prickly spices black coffee and fragrant oak. (240 bottles for the U.S.)"
4008,6,"A no age statement Bunnahabhain destined to replace the existing 12 year old matured in first and second-fill sherry casks. Raisins fruit spice furniture polish and roasted nuts on the nose along with an edge of brine. Rich and full-bodied in the mouth with malt sweet sherry and cotton candy plus cloves and a sprinkling of sea salt. The finish offers red berries lively spice and dark chocolate. £40"
4009,9,"Independent bottlings of Cragganmore are hard to come by and this one is a beauty. Cragganmore is not rich heavy or sweet like many Speyside whiskies. This one is medium-bodied yet firm. It is clean on the palate throughout (with a brief honeyed vanilla note before becoming dry) and it is loaded with spice and dried fruits that continue to evolve. Long lingering finish. The decision to forego chill-filtering certainly reveals more of this whisky’s subtle yet persistent complexity."
4010,9,"A whisky that defies its age. It is remarkably clean and fresh with no suggestion of excessive oak. Fragrant aroma with notes of vanilla coconut honeyed malt cereal grain and linseed. Similar follow through on the palate with a texture that is soft lightly oily and soothing. Clean finish. One of the best Tamdhu whiskies I’ve tasted."
4011,6,"The nose is fresh with sea salt tangerines and light smokiness. Vanilla sultanas malt a hint of sherry hazelnuts and woodsmoke are present on the oily palate. Lingering in the finish with salt and drying smoke."
4012,9,"Antique gold color. Fragrant aroma with floral notes soft honey tones vanilla and delicate fruit (orange and lemon). Light to medium in body and soft in texture. Flavors are similar to the whisky's aroma very clean and with great balance-the woody notes one would expect from a whisky this old are kept in check."
4013,6,"Spicy sultanas greengage plums toffee and new leather on the nose. Damsons prunes black pepper mint and old oak on the palate. The finish is musky slightly smoky with fruit spices dark chocolate licorice and tannic oak. An intriguing take on Bunnahabhain. (1260 bottles)"
4014,6,"Lagavulin at an odd age representing House Lannister and showcasing its lion sigil. The nose is floral with rose hips toffee and fragrant peat notes. Full on the palate with toffee apples cinnamon earthy peat and smoked haddock in salted butter. The smoked fish combines with fennel in the lengthy finish."
4015,6,"This 18 year old single malt is stylistically very different from the older releases in Chapter 4. The nose is soft with honey and mashed banana. Ginger and crème brûlée notes in time. Medium-bodied the creamy palate follows the nose closely introducing vanilla custard coconut and chopped almonds. The finish dries slightly with a hint of chili heat. £800"
4016,9,"Port Ellen for sure! Very old-fashioned in nature: intertwined notes of tarry rope coal soot rooty peat toffee dark chocolate and walnuts spiked with coffee bean anise cracked peppercorn and a hint of ginger. Dry smoky long slightly austere finish. This Port Ellen is a bit moody (maybe even has an attitude problem) but I’m not complaining."
4017,9,"This (rather young) Islay distillery’s second release. Like the first it’s aged for about three years and then finished in sherry casks—this time for a shorter two and a half months. Its flavor is similar to the first release.
Once again I am quite impressed. It’s very mature for its age with good viscosity showing smoldering peat coal tar black licorice stick burnt dark berried fruit thick-cut marmalade shoo-fly pie (think molasses) toffee apple cocoa powder cinnamon and a suggestion of wet sheep. Long peat smoke finish.£47"
4018,6,"This offers a slightly oily nose with orchard fruits vanilla cocoa powder nutmeg cucumber sprinkled with white pepper and very subtle smoke. Powerful flavors of peppery fruit and malt on the palate with honey butterscotch milk chocolate cinnamon and mellow oak. The finish is lengthy and redolent of toffee apples."
4019,6,"Aged in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks; the nose is initially relatively reticent slightly earthy with a hint of drinking chocolate emerging sherry notes and subtle orange. Toffee more chocolate and spicy dried fruits on the relatively full-bodied palate. Long in the finish with wood spices."
4020,6,"Quantities of Optic and Oxbridge barley varieties were grown on eight Islay family farms during 2009 and the following year this grain was distilled then matured in bourbon and French wine casks. The nose offers ginger melon malt sweet (lit) pipe tobacco freshly baled straw resin vanilla and spice. Chewy in the mouth; oily with toffee spices and youthful oak notes. The finish features oysters with lemon squeezed over them."
4021,6,"Peated to 96.9 ppm this 8 year old was aged for 4 years in first-fill American oak and then in third-fill French oak sauternes casks. Sea salt and buttery smoke on the early nose becoming more honeyed. The palate is oily and relatively mellow with pineapple enveloped in rich spicy peat smoke. Quite long in the finish with Jaffa oranges pepper and chili. (24000 bottles; Travel Retail exclusive)"
4022,1,"No hiding that this is one of BenRiach’s peated variants with smoke coming at you like an out of control garden bonfire but the inherent sweetness of the distillery character adds a counterpoint: cinnamon-dusted apples baking in the fire before angelica and cannabis (someone tells me) come through. The interplay between fruits and grassy smoke continues on the palate alongside toffee nougat peach syrup and salty licorice before the smoke returns. A belter. And a great price."
4023,1,"Sherry butt once more but this is much more relaxed in its attentions — think Montgomery Clift seducing Elizabeth Taylor rather than De Niro chatting up Liza Minelli. Sweetness is the key here gentle and slightly caramelized with touches of molasses-like concentration and even a whiff of the top of a crème brûlée. The palate surprises with its continued freshness; apple and the distillery’s distinctive earthy richness. Great balance.£382"
4024,1,"The introductory expression of the range shows a further example of the widening of the Mortlach style. Stewed and dried fruits mingle with light earth notes wet Labrador supple shoe leather and varnish. A drop of water is all that’s needed to add a savory element and even some funky fruitiness reminiscent of cooking agave. The palate is big and chocolaty with some meat underneath. Hefty but elegant. The distillery character is not only intact but enhanced. £55/500 ml"
4025,1,"The youngest of this Family Cask selection shows Glenfarclas in a surprisingly citric light with plenty of citrus peels — tangerine marmalade and orange syrup as well as sultana suede wax polish (surprising in a youngish dram) and chocolate — a recurring theme here. It is almost as if all the more lifted elements in each of the previous casks have here united. Mature but highly expressive and a great starter. £172"
4026,1,"This is Rare Old at higher strength for folks who haunt Travel Retail outlets. The upping of strength also changes the dynamic making things sweeter with mushed berries and Seville orange but also deeper with more overt meatiness stewed tea and the same varnished note. Dense thick stewed orchard fruits are on the palate alongside some acetone and with water burning rosemary and dry licorice. Similar but with more heft. £75/500 ml"
4027,6,"Part of anCnoc’s Peaty Collection Cutter has been distilled from malt peated to 20.5 ppm. The result is a dram with a nose of ashy peat and medicine cabinets backed by vanilla and canned apricots. Rich peat on the palate with citrus fruit and crème brûlée. The slightly oily finish is long and bonfire-like."
4028,1,"Although one of the old Speyside crew (along with Mortlach Glenfarclas and Macallan) Balmenach has inexplicably in my mind never even achieved cult status. It has simply kept on making rich powerful worm tub-condensed spirit for a multitude of blends. This rare bottling therefore is hugely welcome and shows a friskier than usual side — earthy for sure and a lick of leather as well but also walnut and sultana. The palate is deep and languorous with a savory edge. £145 (Not available in the U.S.)"
4029,6,"This veteran expression from Deanston Distillery was matured in refill bourbon casks before spending no fewer than 10 years in oloroso sherry butts. Rose petals fresh pineapple clotted cream cinnamon and dusty oak on the enticing nose. Unctuous in the mouth with apple pie cinnamon hazelnuts and ginger. Drying slowly to pleasing fruity tannic notes. Extremely long finish with a persistent citric tang. (Less than 500 bottles globally)"
4030,6,"This is the oldest regular bottling from Glenmorangie. It offers peaches in cream honey and almonds on the elegant yet relatively substantial nose. Tropical fruit on the smooth full palate with cinnamon chocolate cake and a long finish of dried fruit and tangy oak. Expensive compared to the 18 year old which scores closely."
4031,12,"A whole lotta beach: oyster shells brine vanilla saltwater taffy and bonfire plus fresh coconut shavings jasmine and freesia. Oily in the mouth it’s drying without water highlighting salinity smoke cigar wrapper lemon oil and Jordan almonds. With water lemon vanilla taffy and mouth-puckering saline; the smoke is less overt. It finishes clean sweet and simple with grilled lemon and lingering smoke. (298 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
4032,1,"We had some new Benromachs from Gordon & MacPhail last issue that illustrated what the firm has been up to since it purchased the site in 1992. This release comes from its previous incarnation as part of DCL. The elegant mature nose shows an ‘Old Speyside’ light smokiness alongside barley cacao cigar humidor and potpourri. The palate is gentle and unctuous with some sherried touches while the smoke reruns on the very end. £150 (Not available in the U.S.)"
4033,6,"The latest limited release of 21 year old Springbank has been matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Sherry and bourbon notes are well integrated on the early nose which follows up with succulent tropical fruits toffee and a whiff of earthy peat. The palate is complex confident and oily with dry sherry notes almonds figs vanilla wood smoke and a hint of the sea. The lengthy finish boasts caramel cinnamon brine and soft peat. £182"
4034,1,"Here is Macallan in full-blown masculine mode. Initially it seems tight and (sherry) cask driven but soon you are taken into a winter kitchen with scents of venison and appropriate rowanberry edges adding a sweet and sour fruitiness. That wild berry note is given another nudge by a whiff of burning juniper. The palate shows it to be thick with a quivering mass of black fruits and a finish of molasses and licorice. A feast. £75"
4035,6,"A 2015 addition to the Tomintoul range of single malts carrying age statements this expression was matured in bourbon casks like the rest of the lineup but has a slighter higher ABV than most. Toffee peaches and newly polished furniture on the nose. Pleasing rounded mouthfeel with Jaffa orange honey malt black pepper and developing tannins. The finish yields more malt lively spices green apples black tea and nutty oak."
4036,1,"This is one of a trio from Chivas Bros. who every year release limited editions of 500 ml cask strength bottlings from a selection of its estates. These are predominantly only for sale on site or by mail order through www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com.

My pick of this batch. Strathisla’s a small traditional distillery whose make is mostly pressed into service for the Chivas Regal blends. It’s a hard to pin down malt and it’s this elusive character that shows here: firm then soft fragrant then deep. The nose is intense and spicy with wax nougat chocolate hazelnut and fresh-opened banana. The palate is explosive with real presence and power whose firm core is softened by honey and poached fruits. Complex is the word. £37"
4037,1,"Amber. Very meaty with a touch of cordite then dark fruits wet earth and autumn woods cut with spicy licorice and Darjeeling tea. Water brings down this exuberance adding iris and whole grain bread. The palate has typical full-on Mortlach brawny muscle with chestnut honey-glazed venison. Water bringing out sweetness but without ever losing that glowering core. Lovers of the old 16 year old apply here."
4038,6,"Companta—Gaelic for friendship—is the fifth of Glenmorangie’s Private Edition releases. It comprises a blend of whiskies finished in Clos de Tart Grand Cru wine casks and in fortified wine casks from Côtes du Rhône. Big fruity leathery notes on the nose. Spicy with sultanas almonds and icing sugar. The palate is rich and complex with cocoa powder nutmeg more leather and redcurrants. Long and fruity in the finish with vibrant spices. Red berries predominate."
4039,1,"Rooted in the earth and redolent of late autumn. There’s a plummy thread that runs through this range; here we’ve gone to prune mixed with dried cherries and a sweet/savory edge whose whiff of heavy rose petal is reminiscent of Barolo. Robust yet sweet. Heady like chocolate-covered Turkish Delight. The palate has oloroso notes alongside Assam-like tannins. One to have with water on the side. Classical in structure and aromatics but that vinous sweetness is new. £120"
4040,9,"A very clean whisky with fragrant dried flowers aromas of germinating barley textured honey vanilla waver coconut cream and teasing fresh pineapple. Drying delicately minty finish. For those who love the richly elegant non-sherried style of older Glenlivet whiskies."
4041,6,"Benromach’s first triple-distilled single malt was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. The nose offers peaches with a wisp of sweet smoke vanilla and a hint of lime. Voluptuous and very sweet on the palate; intense sugary orchard fruits and stem ginger with the characteristic Benromach peat smoke dialed back. The finish embraces insistent black pepper nutmeg and very mild peat. £45"
4042,9,"Aged exclusively in first-fill bourbon casks and bottled unfiltered and at natural cask strength. This takes the usually subtle Glenlivet and makes it more vibrant amplifying its flavors while accentuating the bourbon oak. Tight notes of honeyed malt vanilla bean toasted oak bright fruit and nuts are peppered with more subtle floral and spice notes. Dry spicy finish. A Glenlivet with pizzazz."
4043,9,"Antique amber color. This whisky maintains the elegance cherished by Glenlivet enthusiasts but finishing the whisky in limousin oak produces a whisky of deeper wood notes particularly wood spices (vanilla sandalwood perhaps even mint) and floral notes. It’s rich complex and dry-especially on the finish."
4044,6,"The sixth batch in this highly regarded series comprises whisky aged in five refill sherry butts seven DoubleWood refill sherry butts and nine bourbon barrels. The nose is soft and inviting with honey pineapple vanilla caramel and ginger. The palate is rounded rich and sweet with honey vanilla apples and pears. Tangy citrus fruit star anise and oak in the lengthy finish."
4045,9,"Younger bottlings of Glenlivet are often quite elegant and subtle. But such finesse isn’t always evident in older expressions which often become dominated by sherry and oak. This one at 35 years of age demonstrates plenty of elegance and finesse. What impresses me most about this whisky is that you wouldn’t know it was 35 year old just by taste. It isn’t the least bit tired on the palate and it is very clean without the excessive woodiness often found in whiskies of this age. Plus the balance of flavors is impeccable-vanilla honeyed malt peaches pineapple heather and just a touch of oak. A very polished refined whisky."
4046,1,"There’s a fascinating journey taking place here. The nose takes you indoors; caramelized tropical fruits coffee cake a spent fire in the grate and just the merest whiff of the waves hitting the beach. The palate however places you squarely aboard a yacht under sail: salt spray deck and engine oil worn leather upholstery. It seems way more mature than 12 years. The intensity is lost with water but you gain more smoke. A great bottling."
4047,6,"Initially the nose is very different than that of the younger Glen Deverons with brown paper and malt vinegar. Becoming buttery with coconut ice and citrus fruit. Ultimately a caramel note reminiscent of the 16 year old (see below). Rich and waxy on the palate with dark berry fruits almonds vanilla and treacle. Sweet and sour. The medium-length finish offers green berries and a hint of aniseed. Real depth of flavor and individuality here. Exclusively available to travelers at World Duty Free Group stores in selected airports throughout the UK and Spain.   £250/700 ml"
4048,6,"This is the final release in a three-part series that began in 2016 with One For The Road followed by One For All. Initially aged for 18 years in bourbon barrels then finished in virgin American oak quarter casks. The nose features tinned peach segments coconut and white pepper. The palate offers caramel marzipan almonds and sultanas. Dark chocolate raisins and black pepper in the finish. £130"
4049,1,"Another that should need no introduction. The thing to look for in Talisker as with all smoky whiskies is sweetness that gives the requisite balance to the drying effect of smoke. Underneath Talisker’s smoke which ain't as all-pervading as Lagavulin is a sweet pear-like quality. When young there are notes of the land: heather moor sweet seaweed and a finish that has a distinctive cracked black pepper hit."
4050,1,"Rich amber in hue sweet and mellow with initial amontillado sherry notes that give way to Mortlach meatiness; here a lamb tagine with prune apricot and gravy juices. This elegance gives way to a fascinating palate mix of the sweet and the savory with citrus sultana and a rowanberry jab on the end mingling with just a bit of smoke. Everything mellowed by time and oak. Very good indeed. £99"
4051,1,"Light amber. The initial impression is one of bulk. There are heavy florals — think lilies and stewed white fruit and just-overripe banana — but this is given a mysterious extra heft by an underpinning of a light meatiness accompanied by a tiny lift of (good) sulfur. The palate is unsurprisingly thick and creamy with huge fruit that fills the mouth. A highly physical old-style Speyside dram with classic distillery character. A statement whisky that is a must-try."
4052,6,"Hand-rolled tobacco on the early nose floral with sweet peat smoke vanilla ripe apples and raspberries heated over a wood fire. Smooth and mildly herbal on the palate with spicy smoke and rich soft fruit notes and lingering peat cinnamon and cocoa powder. Licorice smoky fruit and tannins in the finish. (1350 bottles for U.S.)"
4053,9,"Very dynamic complex and powerful. Here’s what I’m picking up in somewhat descending order in taste profile: leafy smoke coal tar mocha fudge with dark chocolate chips smoked olive peppered seaweed salad fruit (lemon lime) genever brine-tinged grass and (with some coaxing) floral notes (violet?). Compared to last year’s debut release of Supernova this one is certainly comparable but I feel it’s a tad richer with more leafy smoke and ripe barley. It also seems a bit more polished less aggressive. I like it a little more than its predecessor (rated 89)."
4054,1,"This latest installment of the Tun 1401 series is a classic expression of old mature Balvenie where a waxiness akin to furniture polish slides into mead-like aromas; actually more like metheglin as there’s an herbal spiced element. Its textural richness means it is best with water on the side allowing deep earthy licorice and cigar ash tones to develop along with just the lightest squeeze of tannin. (U.S. only.)"
4055,6,"Warm leather on the nose slightly prickly spice damsons dipped in iodine red berry fruits barbecued meat and underlying earthiness. The palate is oily offering dry fruity red wine notes cinnamon raisins prune juice wood embers and discreet peat smoke. The finish dries with black coffee dark berries and toasted oak. (1920 bottles for U.S.)"
4056,1,"The oldest of a new three-strong range from Glenrothes called the Manse Brae series; the youngest component here is 21 years old. Serious and lightly meaty the savory characters come at you mixing gun smoke with cypress sandalwood dark chocolate and dunnage warehouse. The headiness of moist forest floor continues on the tongue along with a burst of honeyed peach. Moving in many directions simultaneously…and slowly. Keep this neat. Classic Rothes. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €140"
4057,6,"Shoreline aromas with lime caramel and sweet peat. Mildly medicinal with coffee grounds. The palate offers Jaffa oranges coated in earthy peat smoke with pipe tobacco and black pepper. Licorice cocoa powder dried fruits brine and drying peat in the finish. (30000 bottles)"
4058,1,"Light gold. A beautiful oxidized note with soft fruitcake steamed pudding a little hint of overripe fruits and sweet spices. As it opens there’s barley sugar sweets then custard tart with nutmeg clover honey and marzipan. Complex in other words. Water shows how well-layered it is. It starts sweetly in the mouth with a thick honeyed texture which becomes more delicate with water. Elegant long and a great example of mature ’Rothes. £80"
4059,1,"Ian MacLeod’s first release of Tamdhu was a belter. Now finally it’s been joined by this high-strength NAS. There’s no hint of the high strength on the nose which is all caramel toffee and shortbread backed with sultana-like sherry cask influence. The palate is the same: nut dark fruits and date. Hugely approachable. With water it’s a matter of…chocolate? Maltesers! All you want in a sherried whisky and it won’t burn a hole in your wallet either. £60"
4060,6,"Toiteach A Dhà means ‘smoky two’ in Gaelic and follows the previously released Toiteach. The nose opens with aromatic smoke and brine while red berries caramel nutmeg and cloves develop. Significantly greater sherry wood influence on the palate compared to the last version plus Jaffa oranges pipe tobacco nougat cloves black pepper and smoked fish. Medium to long in the finish with drying sherry oak pepper salt and dark chocolate."
4061,6,"Initially aged in bourbon casks this then spent an unspecified period of time in first-fill European oak butts. Rich fruit notes on the nose marzipan and light sherry. Sweet floral notes in time with fondant cream and vanilla pods. Viscous palate delivery with sweet sherry cinnamon baked apple figs caramel and hot chocolate. Orange and allspice on the nutty finish."
4062,6,"On the nose fresh fish wrapped in bacon with a squeeze of lemon cooked at a beach barbecue. Floral and allspice notes emerge. The palate is lightly oily medium-peated meaty and softly spiced with pineapple and melon. The finish dries with more fruit and peppery peat. Balanced and inviting."
4063,12,"Pure clean malt shines throughout this whisky the first Daftmill bottling for sale in the U.S. Shortbread candle wax Golden Delicious apple rose garden apricot ginger and cinnamon on the nose. The palate is biscuity and sweet with vanilla shortbread cookies candied pistachios and crushed almonds; lemon and orange peel and lively rose oil perk things up once water is added. Tobacco cinnamon and toasted almonds and hazelnuts fade like a whisper on the gentle soft finish. (1260 bottles)"
4064,6,"Ealanta is the fourth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition series and has been aged in heavily-charred virgin white oak casks from Missouri for nineteen years. The result is a nose of American cream soda milk chocolate fudge pineapple and honey; spicy and creamy. Silky smooth in the mouth with brittle toffee and orange notes; gently herbal with a suggestion of cloves and newly-sawn wood. Long in the finish with citrus fruit oak aniseed and an enduring spicy creaminess."
4065,1,"More smoke than is common from this distillery and age. The aromas are food-related: initially roast ham with caramelized sugars then a clambake then oven-roasted lobster. With water a distinct whiff of the goat shed (nice by the way). The palate is refined and mature but with fresh fruits retained with oak and smoke beautifully integrated. A mature Caol Ila in similar vein to the excellent (and significantly more keenly priced) 25 year old. (7638 bottles)"
4066,9,"Waves of fruit (apple pie orange marmalade sultana ripe pineapple) accented with notes of dark chocolate roasted nuts and spice (cinnamon vanilla ginger evergreen) particularly on the finish. (In the past I’ve thought that a couple of these limited edition Glemorangie wood finishes were a little overdone with the finishing but not this one)."
4067,1,"Robust Port Charlotte character with salami and jamon serrano to the fore. Somewhat like eating a chorizo and roasted red pepper sandwich on the beach on a summer’s day but it retains the sweet freshness of the distillery character. With water the lovely smell of cow’s breath. There’s dry smoke to start with on the palate becoming sweet (flash-fried scallop) with sugared almond on the finish. For me PC comes fully of age here. £55"
4068,12,"Two oaks are better than one in this single malt which marries whiskies matured in sherry-seasoned casks of both American and European oak. The sherry imparts aromas of raisins figs hazelnuts blanched almonds candied orange peel and leather. A backbone of vanilla sweetness on the palate supports layers of ginger and white pepper dark chocolate leather raisins toasted hazelnuts and orange oil. This Macallan joins the core line between the Sherry Oak and Fine Oak ranges. Warming and rich without being syrupy it doubles up on accessibility with its balance and remarkably affordable price for its quality and age. Number 17 in the 2017 Top 20"
4069,9,"Style: Highland single malt scotch Color: Golden honey Aroma: Lush and mouthwatering. Notes of honey peaches in syrup golden raisins coconut vanilla and background resinous oak. Palate: Creamy and velvety in texture. Honey and fruit up front with some oak notes wood resins and vanilla mid-palate becoming sweet again with a soothing finish."
4070,7,"Much of Caol Ila’s malt goes into Johnnie Walker blends so it’s a rare treat to see a cask strength offering. This release is Caol Ila on steroids featuring a deeply smoky and meaty nose with bacon campfire leather sea salt and iodine. On the palate the smoky fire continues to burn with intense smoke and salt combined with sweet honey malt.  An extremely long finish will have you exhaling smoke long after the dram is gone. (Julio’s Liquors only)"
4071,6,"The nose is pleasingly floral with soft spice malt heather in bloom and even a suggestion of violets. Well textured on the palate oily and nutty with tropical fruits honey milk chocolate vanilla and malt. The finish is lengthy with a hint of citrus and warming spices. (Cask no. 69; 287 bottles)"
4072,6,"Thor is the first in Highland Park’s new cask strength Valhalla Collection with a fresh expression inspired by the Nordic gods due to be released annually over the next four years. Ginger sherry Christmas spices wood smoke vanilla and a hint of lemon on the complex confident nose. Notably spicy in the mouth with peaches clotted cream sherry and more smoke. Long in the finish with lots of ginger a little aniseed and finally spicy peat."
4073,1,"“Ardbeg in Perpetuum” would mean “Ardbeg forever.” It’s made up of a mélange of different casks: American oak refill French oak…and others. Intense marine with pineapple wet moss tar cracked black pepper and a nuttiness. The palate is oily sweet with smoked cream balanced by a very pure acidity then soot and char. Will the fact that it isn’t an extreme Ardbeg satisfy everyone? Probably not. Is it a bloody good session drink? Damn right it is. (200th anniversary bottling)"
4074,6,"Temporis is a peated variant of BenRiach and like its unpeated 21 year old stablemate it was matured in a mix of four types of barrels: bourbon virgin oak Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry. Sweet leather and peat on the nose; emerging vanilla and woodsmoke. Quite muscular on the palate where orchard fruits are balanced by drying oak. White pepper and aniseed in the relatively long finish."
4075,6,"Seven types of European and American oak casks were used for maturation. Lively on the nose with orange malt sherry and sweet oak. Initially a touch hot on the palate with sherry and cloves then toffee and vanilla red apples figs and cocoa. The finish is medium to long with spicy sherry."
4076,9,"Amber gold color. Rich aromas of complex fruit and vanilla. Thick and rich in body with a mouth-coating texture. Flavors of honeyed malt well structured fruit and vanilla with a long finish."
4077,9,"Amber color. Lush rich aromas of rummy toffee nuts vanilla with interwoven notes of glazed fruit. On the heavy side of medium in body and silky. There are layers of sweetness on the palate (toffee caramel marzipan and dates) becoming nutty with a pleasing oak woodiness to balance the sweetness. Long dryish finish with notes of spice and fruit."
4078,1,"Using barley grown on Rockside Farm this is fresh sweet (agave syrup) delicate and lightly buttery with touches of lily of the valley and lemon sponge cake mix. The cereal character is restrained with a charred hint on the palate along with banana mandarin cassia and pink marshmallows (untoasted). The Laddie’s floral notes emerge late and the whiff of white pepper on the end is all there is to remind you of its youth. A classy young whisky. £45"
4079,7,"An old-style whisky that harkens back to a time when Scotland wasn’t sliced and diced by region but defined by style. This is meaty with a capital M with a rich oily deep character. On the palate it’s big and beautiful with salt oyster shell honey roasted green pepper smoke dried fruit beef jerky leather and oak. Earthy peat smoke dances throughout giving support but never stealing focus. This is about as masculine as Highland whisky gets. (U.S. only)"
4080,6,"One of four Octomore 08 Masterclass releases this was distilled in 2011 from Islay barley peated to 309 ppm. Fifty-six percent of the spirit was matured in first-fill bourbon casks while the remainder was aged in European oak wine casks. Barbecue smokiness on the nose with wet peat and citrus fruitiness. On the palate earthy peat full-bodied red wine and milk chocolate. Peat smoke to the fore in the finish with ginger and chili. (18000 bottles)"
4081,1,"Matured in first-fill sherry casks here we have Bowmore at its ballsiest with massively bold notes of prune dried fig salted treacle toffee shoe leather rose petal and savory maritime edges that glance toward Marmite all of which are infiltrated by clouds of smoke. The palate has retained sweetness mixing black cherry pipe tobacco and cloves. Powerful and seriously impressive with fantastic balance that retains Bowmore identity adds richness ups the peatiness and leaves you under Satan’s spell."
4082,6,"Lagavulin 12 year old is represented in Diageo’s annual Special Releases lineup for the fifteenth consecutive year. This was matured in refill American oak barrels. Earthy peppery peat are present on the nose along with hazelnuts seaweed and lemon juice. It offers citrus fruit bonfire smoke pepper chili and antiseptic on the palate. The medium-length finish features smoked chilies."
4083,6,"The nose offers rich fruit—plums and sultanas—with milk chocolate and new leather. The palate is silky and luxurious with medium-sweet sherry vanilla blackcurrants and treacle. Dark berries and black pepper in the lengthy mildly oaky finish."
4084,6,"The lost Dufftown distillery of Pittyvaich last appeared in the Special Releases as a 25 year old in 2015. Like that bottling this was also aged in refill American oak hogsheads. Initially it’s slightly savory on the nose with salted caramel walnuts and spicy raisins. Oily on the palate with pineapple apple crumble malt cinnamon and nutmeg. Toffee milk chocolate and licorice in the peppery finish. (4680 bottles)"
4085,12,"Another Kirkland with evident sherry: raisins figs sugared almonds leather and pistachio-studded chocolate show up in full force along with a note of rancio indicating its age. Additional flavors of nougat orange oil candied violets and ginger swish into a full rounded finish that settles in for a lengthy stay. This comes from the same undisclosed distillery as Kirkland’s 20 year old. (Costco)"
4086,6,"This limited edition was distilled in 2004 and aged in eleven first-fill bourbon barrels. Warm lemon juice rock pools new tweed and new leather plus peat smoke and charcuterie on the nose. The palate is robust sweet and fruity with spicy orange vanilla caramel and earthy peat. Long in the finish with light tannins and peat coated with stewed fruits. (420 bottles for U.S.)"
4087,12,"An array of flowers and fruits tumbles from the glass: lilacs orange blossom lemon oil raspberry blueberry shelled walnuts and a hint of licorice. Very light-bodied but with entrancing candied citrus peel bubble gum and strawberry candy flavors along with sherry cask notes of walnut hazelnut milk chocolate raisin and ginger. Sweet oak and berries on the finish which is light but lengthy. (Total Wine & More)"
4088,12,"The nose offers rubbery-sweet peat and an array of fruit: apples strawberries raspberries guava mango watermelon and jackfruit shot through with briny oyster shells. Juicy fruit—kiwi guava orange pineapple—on the palate mingles with minerality medicinal peat dark chocolate and salt. The finish is beach bonfire smoke grilled pineapple and finally tobacco leaf. This is balanced and beautiful but would be downright stunning at a higher proof. (Total Wine & More)"
4089,12,"Layers of rich fruit pervade the nose—plums in syrup mango guava peach dried kiwi—along with white pepper ginger and tobacco leaf. Those same fruits tumble over each other on the palate which is light but complex with gentle spice cigar wrapper dark chocolate and slightly drying oak. The finish though light retains length through chocolate tobacco and polished oak flavors. This tastes remarkably good at its low proof but what a thing it would be at 46%. (Trader Joe’s)"
4090,6,"Like previous releases in the Cask Strength series this was matured in a mix of oloroso and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. The nose offers honey soft sherry eucalyptus and cherry blossom. Supple and sugary on the very approachable palate with nutty toffee dark sherry and dark chocolate-coated cherry liqueurs. Long and spicy with ripe plums in the finish."
4091,6,"Distilled from malt peated to 167 ppm this whisky’s complex maturation program includes first-fill port and cognac second-fill American whiskey and virgin oak casks. The nose is sweet with ginger marzipan rock pools and floral smokiness. Initially barley sugar and malt on the palate then drier with a hint of iodine medicated soap old leather and dried peat. Peppery with antiseptic and smoky oak in the finish. (12000 bottles)"
4092,9,"Similar to Laphroaig Quarter Cask but also finished in oloroso sherry casks. Fruit and smoke: fleshy red berries red licorice toffee ripe barley coal tar sun-baked seaweed peat smoke and a hint of coffee grounds. Tarry finish. I rated the Quarter Cask a 91 and I think this whisky is similar in quality. If you like sherry-influenced whiskies then go for the Triple Wood. If not then consider the Quarter Cask. (Travel Retail and European exclusive)"
4093,6,"The latest batch of cask strength GlenDronach should make Aberlour a’bunadh look to its laurels. It is matured in a combination of Pedro Ximenez and oloroso sherry casks. The nose is quite perfumed with sweet sherry figs nutmeg satsumas and candied peel. Voluptuous in the mouth with early bright fruit notes cinder toffee and caramel followed by darker sherry and raisin notes. Lightly peppery and tannic with plain chocolate. £55"
4094,9,"A new expression due out in March positioned between the 12 and 18 year old versions. A fresh and enormously drinkable whisky; very silky with honeyed malt delicate citrus and berry fruit floral notes (heather and lavender) and a hint of cocoa and sea spray."
4095,9,"Pale white wine color. Smoky youthful aroma. There’s no surprises here-it definitely smells like a young Ardbeg. Big beautiful explosion of smoky tarry flavors that evolve and seem to linger on the palate indefinitely. This is the first Ardbeg release I've tasted since the distillery's long shut down in the 1980s. After the shut down they discontinued their floor maltings so I was concerned that it might not taste like the Ardbeg of old. Ardbeg fans can let out a big sigh of relief. This one is big and gutsy-just the way we like it. My only criticism of this particular release is that it could have used about one or two more years in oak to tame some of the spirity nature of the whisky. Otherwise this is wonderful stuff!"
4096,9,"The first 10 year old distilled by the current owners back in 2001. Lovely marriage of both bourbon and sherry casks and quite fresh with a maturity resembling a 12 year old rather than 10. Smooth on the palate and very drinkable with creamy vanilla honeycomb banana bread bright lemon melon (honeydew cantaloupe) tangerine candied ginger and delicate brine. With all the Bruichladdich razzle-dazzle over the past decade we can embrace this unpretentiously delicious Laddie with open arms."
4097,6,"Recently bottled by Duncan Taylor in their non-colored non-chill filtered NC2 range this 13 year old expression of Springbank initially exhibits tinned pears on the nose then smoked fish cooked in butter coconut oil brine and a hint of lemon. More sweet wood smoke with time turning to char. The palate opens with profound sweet fruit swiftly followed by salt lime and medicinal notes. Lingering with ginger in the pleasantly oaky finish. £64"
4098,1,"This is quite different from the Adelphi Glen Grant bottling (below) being more cask-driven but Glen Grant’s clean fruitiness remains although transformed by age. Its apples are baked with some added caramelized juices thrown in; we see apricot alongside dried lemon peel and light sweet spice. The waxiness here is akin to leather oil while the oak has sufficient grip to give structure. In time there are hints of the cellar — burlap and wet earth. Delicious and best neat. £184"
4099,1,"Immediately you can tell this is a complex old mature whisky — that hint of rancio is there but there’s more of a beeswax character than on the Adelphi bottling (below) along with the peachiness that often appears in old drams. This is balanced by light coconut even a hint of grist. The waxiness seen on the nose allows it to cling to the tongue while the fruits become jellied. Benefits from a drop of water allowing lemon and vanilla to show. £210"
4100,1,"On more familiar ground with this G&M bottling of one of Speyside’s most iconic single malts this is Macallan in full-on sherried form. Highly aromatic with powdered clove hints of incense and fig behind which is cacao Bolivar cigar and molasses. The palate has immediate smoke and surprisingly gentle tannins — the inherent oiliness of the spirit keeping any grip at bay. Very long leathery prune-like (think armagnac) and dense. A classic after-dinner mouth-filler."
4101,9,"Aged in first and (mostly) second fill sherry casks. The sherry is kept in balance and does not mask Auchentoshan’s subtle beauty. The classic Auchentoshan creamy grassy freshness abounds complemented by honey-soaked almonds cereal grain and an array of bright fruit (citrus sultana mandarin). Not as polished as the Auchentoshan 21 year old but quite entertaining. (420 bottles for the U.S.)"
4102,9,"Amber color with gold hues. Soft subtly seductive aromas of creamy vanilla crème brulee tropical fruit oak and a hint of mint. Light to medium in body-silky in texture at first then becoming and firm. On the palate the whisky starts out gently sweet with creamy vanilla and honeyed malt. Subtle tropical fruit notes arrive mid palate. The whisky then begins to dry out fairly rapidly (this is a 36 year old Lowland after all) as dry resinous notes of vanilla mint and herbs reveal themselves. The whisky finishes dry with notes of soft leather. The way the owners of Auchentoshan and Glen Garioch are handling vintage bottlings now is that specialty retailer orders an entire cask and sells it exclusively. This one is a Sam's exclusive. It's older than the previous widely distributed 1966 bottling and less expensive too! You wouldn't expect a triple distilled Lowland whisky to age so gracefully. Auchentoshan is an exception to the rule. It has acquired the depth and maturity from extensive aging yet it still manages to maintain its distillery character and Lowland gentility. Only on the dry finish does it really show its age. But that's a small price to pay for an otherwise very good single cask whisky at a very reasonable price for 36 years old."
4103,6,"This single cask bottling was distilled in December 1995 and matured in a refill hogshead (#258). Warm sweet biscuit notes on the nose plus almonds and tangerines. Substantial on the palate with vanilla fudge and Jaffa orange. Softly spicy with developing licorice. Long in the finish with spicy licorice plain chocolate and light tannins. (258 bottles)"
4104,4,"If every fan of sherried whisky has a favorite GlenDronach then this is a long way down the road to being mine. It has a dusty dried orange peel powdery and perfumey nose a soft and sweet round palate with a dark chocolate tangerine and pink grapefruit heart and a balanced and gentle finish. This was probably once a hollerin’ maned lion of a malt but it’s grown old gracefully and it now purrs and growls beautifully. £80"
4105,6,"GlenDronach is known for its unpeated sherry-matured whiskies. This peated expression was matured in Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry casks and some port pipes. Hand-rolled tobacco smoke ginger honey malt and barbecued bacon on the nose. New leather smoky orange treacle and milk chocolate on the earthy palate. Light smoke wood polish mixed nuts and licorice in the lengthy finish. Pleasing balance of sweet savory and smoky notes. (£51)"
4106,6,"Initial maturation of this expression took place in refill casks followed by heavily charred American oak hogsheads and finally European oak puncheons. The nose is relatively light fruit-forward slightly floral spicy and mildly ashy. Citrus fruits and sweet peat smoke on the palate with fruit and oak spices. Orchard fruits in the finish with just a hint of classic Talisker pepper. (6000 bottles; distillery only) (£95)"
4107,6,"This is the sixth—and oldest—limited annual release of Loch Gorm distilled in 2009 and aged in oloroso sherry butts. The nose is earthy with raisins dry spices smoldering peat and a not unpleasing hint of rubber. The palate is lively with spices sherry cherries and iodine-soaked peats. Aniseed sweet sherried peat and tingling spices in the medium-length finish. (13500 bottles)"
4108,6,"The initial release in Glenglassaugh’s new ‘The Chosen Few’ range has been picked by customer accounts manager Ronnie Routledge. It was distilled in 1976 and matured in an ex-sherry butt that yielded 654 bottles. Initially an aroma of Black Twist tobacco and treacle with sweeter and more floral notes following on. Significant honey influence. Mouth-coating with sweet sherry and tropical fruits plus developing honey and spice notes. Oak toast and dark chocolate in the lingering lively finish. £300"
4109,12,"Floral notes flit among the shortbread vanilla almond flour banana peel and lemon aromas of the nose while the palate is sweet with lemon curd shortbread toasted almonds and coconut and honeydew. Water brings out fresher fruitier flavors but add it sparingly. The soft finish has toasted nuts shortbread oak and ginger. A delicate dram that showcases elegant maturity."
4110,12,"Lily of the valley sweet almonds and light tropical fruit notes—mango and kiwi—on the reticent nose. The palate’s oily texture belies its light body but both characteristics work in tandem to advance lemon and orange toasted almonds bathed in vanilla sugar and sweet oak. Toasted almonds and coconut dusted with cocoa powder create a refined finish."
4128,6,"This expression of The Dalmore Constellation spent its entire 33 years of maturation in an ex-bourbon cask with no additional finishing. The result is a nose of ripe peaches and pears honey and vanilla. Full-bodied rich sweet elegant yet substantial on the palate with pineapples and fudge. Oak and aniseed slowly build but the wood is held at bay. Long and warming in the finish with soft spices. Barely drying. Cask number 594; 199 bottles."
4111,9,"A special Balvenie to honor Master Distiller David Stewart’s 30 years working at the distillery. This is a big and brooding dram. The aroma suggests it is aged in both bourbon and sherry oak. It’s complex and richly flavored (sweeter up front and increasingly dry towards its finish) with notes of honey candied fruit thick cut marmalade vanilla almonds and prominent spicy oak notes. I’m picking up plenty of sherry in this new expression which I like. It finishes firmly dry with notes of spice and tannin. While I enjoy this whisky a great deal you might want to seek out the Balvenie 25 year old (which I rated a 93) while the odd bottle is still available. It is slightly more rounded on the palate and less than half the cost."
4112,6,"Swiss-based Chapter 7 released this 19 year old single malt a marriage of two sherry butts (#796 and #1476). Malt sweet sherry cocktail cherries milky coffee and a slightly earthy undertone on the nose. Very rich on the palate with chewy-sweet soft fruits notably strawberries syrup sponge and lively fruit spices. Mouth-drying in the long finish with aniseed and wood spice. (1076 bottles)"
4113,2,"Fragrant fruit notes—dried red berries raspberry pastilles—ride atop a light peat influence on the nose. The peat becomes stronger on the palate to create a profile of bonfire ash grilled meat dried leaves blackberry jam dark chocolate and black pepper. Water brings out light fruitiness as well as brine and charcoal. The finish is mid-length and smoky with classic notes of Band-Aid iodine wet seaweed and charcoal. (1140 bottles for U.S.)"
4114,6,"The latest BenRiach core-range release was matured in sherry casks then finished in Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry casks. The nose offers rich red wine plums figs and vanilla. Tropical fruits honey vanilla and soft sherry notes feature on the palate. The finish is medium in length and showcases aniseed wood spice and fat Christmas cake sherry notes. Delicious!"
4115,1,"Often overshadowed by other noisier neighbors it is time to reconsider Caol Ila—and this is a fine place to start. Coming from a refill cask it has a nose of sweet crab ham with cider glaze and teasing maritime smoke. The palate mixes salt taffy with top-end peppery olive oil allowing the flavors to cover the palate while the smoke rumbles along constantly before a salt-laden finish. Superlative balance. Find one of those 620 bottles! £85"
4116,6,"Distilled in the spring of 1996 this was matured in bourbon barrels and yields a nose of exotic spices heather in bloom soft aromatic peat and grapefruit sprinkled with iodine. Well-mannered peat brine orange peel vanilla and black pepper on the palate. The finish is long smoky and peppery."
4117,6,"Distilled from 52 tons of Islay barley and filled into 134 casks most of which were second fill. At 5 years old the result is whisky with an initially fresh and zesty nose featuring sea breezes and lemon juice. Mild iodine ginger and sweet peat then develop. Sweet on the full palate with honey cereal notes smoky peat and brine. Oak and chili in the ultimately dry finish."
4118,9,"Beautifully clean and polished on the palate -- it still allows BenRiach’s other flavors to shine through. Ripe complex tropical fruit notes meld with delicate honey and suggestions of shortbread cookies and toasted coconut. Teasing peat and smoke surfaces from time to time. This whisky is a lot of fun to drink. (800 bottles total; 120 for the U.S.)"
4119,6,"This vintage expression from Jura has been matured in three first-fill bourbon casks and then finished for one year in a ruby port pipe. Just 498 bottles have been released. Apricots pineapple caramel butterscotch sultanas and white chocolate on the nose. The palate is warm and spicy with subtle pine and citrus fruits along with coconut and a hint of peat. Long in the finish with more vanilla before dried fruits and oak kick in. The delicate peat remains."
4120,6,"This expression has been finished for an unspecified period in first-fill bourbon barrels. The nose is floral with gentle spices honey developing mangos and apricots with vanilla ice cream plus coconut. Sweet and smooth on the palate with tropical fruits more vanilla and honey plus old leather and developing plain chocolate. The finish is long and drying with slightly astringent oak and wood spices. (600 bottles for the U.S.)"
4121,9,"The fruit (orange marmalade tangerine fresh pineapple) is nearly as dominant as the leafy smoke. Sweet notes of nutty caramel honeyed barley toffee and nougat round out the palate. Ginger cinnamon telicherry pepper tobacco and ash play a supporting role. Lingering fruity smoky finish. For those who like sherried Islay whiskies."
4122,9,"Quite fragrant with a thick oily texture. Sweet notes (vanilla sticky toffee) ripe barley earthy peat licorice root and a hint of melon and citrus. Very clean and characterful. A lot of fun to drink. Nicely done! I can’t imagine a 14 year old Glen Garioch tasting any better than this. (A Julio’s Liquor Exclusive)"
4123,1,"Just pause for a moment before tasting. 50 years. What has happened in the world during that time? How have you changed? What has it done to the whisky? Added a quiet elegance. It brings to mind elements of long-dried concentrated fruit and nut damson even smoke. The tannins are initially dusty but a splash of water adds a fresh potpourri perfume. Is it expensive? For something that’s spent 50 years in a cask? No it isn’t. (937 bottles) £1800"
4124,6,"This spent 9 years in a combination of bourbon and sherry casks then 6 years in first-fill European oak oloroso casks. Sherry is to the fore on the nose with apple pie honey vanilla black pepper and ultimately pipe tobacco. A viscous and rich palate with more apple pie and vanilla while the sherry is drier with new leather and woodsmoke. Salted caramel and spicy oak on the finish."
4125,6,"Following on from 21 and 25 year old expressions of Authenticus BenRiach has now added its oldest variant yet to the lineup. The nose offers orchard fruits honey polished oak and vanilla-tinged peat smoke. Full and fruity on the palate with sweet peat having a presence plus milk chocolate and licorice. The finish is relatively long with citrus fruit ashy smoke and a lingering herbal note. £400; Not available in the U.S."
4126,6,"First released in 2006 this expression was distilled from organically certified barley and aged in virgin oak casks. Spicy new oak and subtle smoke on the nose with white pepper bananas cereal and cut grass. The palate is oily with more pepper hazelnuts dipped in honey and tropical fruits. Vanilla and toffee on the slowly drying finish."
4127,6,"This was matured in a combination of first-fill and refill bourbon casks before 70% was finished in deeply charred casks and 30% in first-fill Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. Char is apparent on the nose along with pineapple wood polish blackcurrants and a sprinkling of sea salt. Oily on the palate with dark berry fruits sherry crème brûlée and oak. The finish is spicy with charred maritime oak."
4129,1,"It’s been quite a year for Lagavulin; a 25 year old is due (but no sample at the time of writing). This was a 6000-strong bottling aged in refill hoggies and ‘bodega’ butts. Initially restrained and mildly oxidized it shows angelica a spritz of lemon juice on potted shrimp then fennel pollen and water mint. The smoke is pulled back. The palate has orchard fruits creosote and moss. Lagavulin’s top notes accentuated but with the depth of age. £125"
4130,9,"The oldest Ardmore I have tasted. Smartly bottled at cask strength and not chill-filtered. (The entry level Ardmore “Traditional” is at the opposite end of the age spectrum tasting quite youthful.) My initial concern with this 30 year old was: would the wood dominate the lovely floral smoky notes I enjoy so much with Ardmore? The wood is certainly present but the smoke still comes through. There’s a gently layered sweetness that complements the smoke (toffee deep caramel subtle honey) licorice root bourbon barrel char coffee grounds and high cocoa chocolate with subtle dried citrus and a suggestion of floral soap. Dry finish with more bourbon barrel char and licorice root. Considering that Ardmore has historically been a blending malt most of the stocks right now are much younger. This is a rare treat. It’s a wee bit thin in body and a little on the dry side from 30 years on wood for me to rate it in the mid 90s but it’s still a very enjoyable whisky."
4131,6,"This expression was aged in remade American oak bourbon hogsheads and French oak Burgundy barriques. Floral aromas on the early nose with classic BenRiach spicy honey and apple juice emerging along with vanilla and white pepper. The palate is full and rich with almonds more honey port wine apple pie sweet oak and cocoa powder. The finish is luxurious with oak tannins and persistent wine notes."
4132,9,"This is not a single-cask bottling like other recent wine-finished releases but the casks they selected are very good ones. Lovely antique amber color. The Madeira dovetails beautifully with the malt and oak and it has matured nicely for a whisky less than ten years old. Lush notes of orange marmalade raspberry tart and panforte all wrapped up in rich toffee and a dusting of nutmeg cinnamon and cocoa. A dry resinous spicy tactile finish adds balance complexity and additional dimension. Smartly bottled at a higher strength. Some of these wine-finished Arran whiskies are impressive. This is one of them."
4133,1,"Although the youngest of the range this has still spent 24 years in a refill butt.  The nose is highly concentrated with freshly-sharpened pencils and black cherry. There’s also some tobacco and then an earthy armagnac-esque pruniness. Water brings out a resinous element supple leather and fruit syrups allowing it to retain complexity. The driest of the range with the most obvious grip; for lovers of big sherried malts. £225"
4134,6,"New to Glen Moray’s core range this was initially matured in bourbon barrels before finishing in port pipes. The nose is fragrant and inviting with raspberries ginger vanilla custard and sultanas. Voluptuous in the mouth with honey cherry liqueur coconut marzipan and milk chocolate vying with contrasting dried fruit and wood notes. The chocolate darkens in the finish with raisins licorice and slightly tannic oak. (4000 bottles; 1200 for U.S.)"
4135,6,"This U.S.-exclusive release was initially aged in first-fill American oak sherry casks before a period of finishing in cognac casks. Spicy red wine notes on the notably aromatic nose with vanilla and light cinnamon. Good texture in the mouth sweet and very approachable with tangerines toffee dates sultanas and milk chocolate. Liqueur chocolates in the smooth lengthy finish. Not overly complex but robust and extremely drinkable."
4136,6,"This veteran from Knockdhu Distillery has been aged in a combination of bourbon and sherry casks. The nose is rich and inviting with apricots in syrup marzipan caramel and new-mown hay. Voluptuous in the mouth with tangy fruits barley sugar cinnamon sherry and ultimately coffee grounds. An oaky finish with cocoa powder white pepper and lemon juice."
4137,9,"A harmonious marriage of fruit and spice. More balanced than last year’s sweet Rum Cask release. In fact this is one of the most deftly-balanced whiskies I’ve tasted this year. Bramble ripe nectarine caramel apple honeyed vanilla and golden raisin spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg. Soft (for Balvenie) lingering warm dried spice finish."
4138,6,"Matured in a mix of sherry casks and bourbon barrels for over 15 years the nose is floral and fruity with honeysuckle nectarines malt and soft spices. Very smooth and creamy on the palate with apple pie butterscotch honey and tangerines combining with dried fruits. Citrus fruit and spicy milk chocolate in the medium-length finish."
4139,9,"The first of Glenmorangie’s new “Private Collection” line of whiskies for Travel Retail. This one is finished in Pedro Ximenez (PX) sherry. With PX being so rich and intense and Glenmorangie spirit so subtly complex and delicate does the sherry dominate here? No it doesn’t. Still this is viscous and very textural for a Glenmorangie. I’m picking up rhum agricole drenched with honeyed apricot toffee almond chocolate-covered raisin glazed citrus and cherry pits all leading to a leathery tobacco-tinged finish. A visceral whisky with plenty of grip. Great for after dinner."
4140,1,"Immediate rancio notes with some hazelnut and cheese rind. Added oxidative notes of nuts moves things into Brandy de Jerez territory. Sumptuous stuff with Miltonduff’s floral character adding a delicate top note something which is enhanced with water. The tannins are light allowing a silky feel to predominate with just enough of a bitter edge to add interest. Very good indeed. £81"
4141,6,"This was aged in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. The nose yields Jaffa orange plums sherry malt and vanilla. Ginger honey more orange dried fruit and toasted oak on the full palate. The finish is relatively long with spicy orange and oak. Complex and satisfying."
4142,1,"Weighty and deep. Instantly seductive: vanilla pod rich fruits the smell of fur coats. A femme fatale of a malt. A base of crisp malt mixes with oak to give balance and structure. Water brings out apple leaf even a little grassiness. The palate is broad and balanced with real sweetness and a tongue-coating quality which softens to dried fruit earthy density with a whiff of smoke. Redolent with the aroma of a dunnage warehouse. A class act."
4143,6,"Butterscotch vanilla pepper and citrus fruit emerge on the nose. A nutty peppery palate features orchard fruits chile spice and a subtle meatiness. Lemon and oak tannins in the medium-length finish."
4144,6,"Glen Garioch spirit is sufficiently robust to cope well with virgin oak and the nose of this expression yields the bold aromas you would expect from heavily-charred virgin oak maturation: spicy milk chocolate buttery malt and ripe peaches. Cocoa malt and cloves on the palate plus lots of wood spice. The finish yields vanilla ginger and the inevitable oak."
4145,6,"Dull tropical fruits followed by emerging vanilla and more fragrant and perfumed
notes on the nose. Full-bodied with very sweet citrus fruits on the early palate which
turn to green berries and dry slowly. Bitter orange fennel and oak tannins in the
lengthy finish. Price is for entire Prima & Ultima Collection of which this whisky is a
part. (469 bottles) £20000"
4146,6,"Having replaced the 16 year old Longmorn with a no age statement Distiller’s Choice owner Chivas Brothers reintroduced the16 year old. Vanilla milk chocolate and honey on the nose plus quite intense sweet pear and apple notes. More rich fruit notes on the nicely textured palate with vanilla and milk chocolate carrying over from the nose plus raisins. The finish is long and silky smooth."
4147,6,"Distilled exclusively with organic barley grown the previous year by Mid Coul Farms near Inverness this 8 year old was aged in bourbon barrels. Barley salted butter peach malt and vanilla on the nose plus cocoa powder. Quite piercing citrus fruits on the smooth palate with more vanilla fudge overripe banana and milk chocolate. Spicy oak and a suggestion of brine in the finish. (18000 bottles)"
4148,6,"This straddles the existing Sherry Oak and Fine Oak ranges by being a mix of spirit matured in both European and American oak sherry casks. Earthy sherry and old leather on the nose with toffee polished oak and cherry blossom. Medium to full-bodied with sherry orange cocoa nutty vanilla and developing wood spices on the honeyed palate. The finish is creamy with insistent spices cocoa and tangy oak."
4149,1,"This Bowmore has been finished in sherry casks but without allowing the exuberance of the cask to overwhelm the dram. Instead there’s concentrated stone fruits lifted smoke dried mint dark chocolate bitter orange peels and some smoke. There’s a teasing hint on the tongue of tropical fruits then a deepening mix of plump dried figs and sultana. Long layered with the smoke seamlessly involved adding accents rather than fogging up proceedings. (Whisky Shop chain only) £70"
4150,6,"This limited release was aged in seven cask types—both American and European oak in a variety of sizes—from four Spanish bodegas: Vasyma Diego Martin Jose Miguel Martin and Tevasa. Citrus fruits ginger black pepper light smoke and rubbery leather on the nose. Ultimately carnations. The palate is rich nutty and sweet with malt toffee sticky sherry maraschino cherries milk chocolate and gentle spice. Long in the finish with spices and creamy cocoa."
4151,6,"This is the oldest core expression of Tomintoul’s Gentle Dram now available in the U.S. It is a classic of this style of Speyside single malt. Peaches malt honey vanilla and developing floral notes on the nose. Full-bodied with ripe apples cocoa milky coffee honey vanilla and soft spices. Spicy and drying with plain chocolate in the relatively lengthy mellow finish."
4152,6,"A refill American oak hogshead matured this whisky. The nose offers malt vanilla fudge pineapple and contrasting lemon. Lively tropical fruits on the palate almonds walnuts and ginger cookies with ever-present oak. Bitter coffee in the medium-length leathery finish."
4153,6,"Sweet antiseptic brine new leather and spice on the nose. The palate is lightly oily
with lemon juice grapefruit salt water soft peat and fish smoked on a beach
barbecue. Smoky citrus fruits in the lengthy gingery finish. Price is for entire Prima
& Ultima Collection of which this whisky is a part. (499 bottles) £20000"
4154,9,"A lovely example of a mature sherried Bowmore. Its rich flavors evolve on the palate and are nicely balanced. Lush fruit juicy oak damp peat and kiln smoke are peppered with cinnamon raisins dates and cocoa. Warming soothing finish. Not quite Black Bowmore but a delicious whisky nonetheless."
4155,6,"Melon honey red apples buttercups and butterscotch on the nose with classic
Clynelish wax on the palate. Herbal with lemon juice that has a little sea salt mixed
into it. Licorice and white pepper in the slightly oily finish. Price is for entire Prima &
Ultima Collection of which this whisky is a part. (941 bottles) £20000"
4156,9,"Darkest now has an age statement of 15 years old. This new release is an improvement from the original Darkest both of which are succulently sherried. It is fuller in flavor and more visceral in both the nose and palate. These differences are subtle but positive. Notes of lush fruit raisin pot-still rum and Heath bars. Citrus and wood spices emerge along with burning peat embers that linger on the finish. Nicely done."
4157,1,"The oldest of the set shows a shift into a sense of calm and quietude. The dried blossoms of youth are there still with a little color to them while a curl of smoke also comes through. Then out of nowhere a sudden eruption of tropical fruits a flaring in the dying light. There’s no oakiness just a distillery framed gently receding. A remarkable dram. It’s almost shameful to discuss cost! £19000"
4158,9,"Antique amber color. Aromas of toffee and malt with interwoven dried fruit flowers and spices-a real potpourri. Rich lush body. Rich flavors of toffee wood resin spices and citrus finishing with notes of malt toffee and a hint of leather and smoke."
4159,1,"The last official Convalmore remains one of my top whiskies. Here is a different meditation on age. There’s soft leather coal smoke and polished brass. The distillery’s waxiness is a spent candle in a deserted chapel the harvest festival fruits wrinkling on the altar. Amazingly in the mouth a shaft of honeyed sunlight comes through to transform the scene into one of life. Everything glows the wax returns and then with the smoke increasing the light fades. Old and fascinating. (2980 bottles)"
4160,9,"A polished whisky light-medium in body with well-rounded flavors. Fruity (ripe orange lemon gumdrops candy apple) with creamy vanilla and a honeyed toasted malt foundation. Soft gentle oak throughout. What a lovely gentle-natured whisky straight down the middle! Bonus points for versatility."
4161,6,"Distilled in December 2005 using malt peated to a whopping 167 parts per million this was matured in a mix of bourbon and Grenache Blanc casks. Old warm leather rich smoke developing peaty peach chocolate-coated toffee pipe tobacco and iodine on the powerful nose. Huge peatiness in the mouth oily smoky orchard fruits developing ginger nuts and sea salt. Warming in the finish with licorice gunpowder tea and ashy peat."
4162,6,"This was matured in first-fill sherry bourbon French wine and tempranillo casks. Initial brine on the nose gives way to malt and orchard fruits sweet smoke and buttery malt. Sweet medicinal smoke notes on the early palate then toffee and peaches drying to aniseed and chili. Long and prickly in the finish with licorice and black pepper. A complex rendering of Port Charlotte."
4194,1,"A heavily peated BenRiach that has been finished in a tawny port pipe. The nose is akin to cherries sloes and blueberries soaked in alcohol. The peatiness manifests itself as a smoky herbal note and shows most on the palate but is never too dominant. An oil of clove coolness takes control on the finish. Great balance and integration; a finish that genuinely works. £53"
4163,4,"Credit to Glengoyne for coming up with something different. There are just 100 bottles of this malt available this year with a further 100 or so released each Christmas from the same cask each year until 2014 effectively offering malt enthusiasts the chance to plot a work in progress. Better still this first effort is one of the best releases ever to come out of the distillery. The name is spot on; it really is Christmas in a glass with the almost feminine aromas of rosewater flowers candy stick and fruit giving way to a huge sherry note on the palate. Dark chocolate cherry orange and chili notes combine to offer up a bold and full malt. Some special bottlings from Glengoyne have been over-oaky or marred by sulfur but not this one. This is clean pure and classy. Can’t wait to see where it goes next."
4164,4,"This is like a blast from the past with much in common with the sherried Cask Strength of old and a welcome treat for any fan of the big sherried Macallans. All the red berry and blood orange notes are present on the nose along with cocoa and a dusty smokiness. The palate is full velvety and chewy with Christmas cake oranges and some nuttiness. Nutmeg and cinnamon fill out the mouth feel before a long and classic sherried finish."
4165,1,"A (very) special anniversary bottling this is old-style brooding Laphroaig. Fully mature and rich it shows that classic roiling mass of kelp oil and brine always balanced by sweetness: in this case autumn berry fruits. Malt adds a crunchiness. The palate is gentle and slow with the characteristic camphoraceous lift of bog myrtle on the back palate which is all that remains of the smoke. Pricey yes but rare. Get saving!"
4166,6,"The latest addition to Glengoyne’s permanent range is a 25 year old matured in European oak sherry casks and presented in non-chill filtered format. Syrup-like on the nose very sweet with milk chocolate ginger Jaffa oranges and sticky toffee pudding. Smooth and sweet on the palate with overt sherry sultanas and gentle spice. The finish is medium to long with a hint of oak old leather and lingering cloves. Bold yet elegant. £250"
4167,6,"This 40 year old was matured in a refill American hogshead. Perfumed on the nose with vanilla soft leather lanolin and lavender. Watery soft fruits on the palate with cocoa powder and ginger. The finish offers more cocoa powder black coffee and licorice-flavored oak. £500 (191 bottles The Whisky Exchange exclusive)"
4168,9,"The distillery closed in 1983 and was replaced by the Clynelish distillery across the street. Classic Brora. Fresh and exuberant for a 25 year old whisky. Briny with citrus zest fruit gum drops dynamic spices and a hint of seaweed and smoke. Appetizing finish. All the flavors are well-integrated and the whisky is very clean. If you don’t have a Brora yet get this one before it’s gone."
4169,6,"Dalmore 25 year old comprises spirit matured initially in American oak casks some of which is then transferred into first-fill bourbon barrels while the remainder goes into Palomino fino sherry butts. The two batches are then reunited in bourbon barrels before a final finishing in tawny port pipes. Vanilla figs toffee and ripe oranges on the festive nose while the palate features more orange peaches milk chocolate and sherry. The chocolate darkens in the lengthy finish with ginger and licorice."
4170,6,"The 18 year old is Loch Lomond’s flagship single malt and marks the improvement in quality from this distillery during recent years. The nose offers peaches and vanilla mild spice pipe tobacco and a hint of sweet wood smoke. Nicely textured with bold sweet citrus fruit flavors vanilla almonds and cocoa. Nutty gently spicy with cocoa and a hint of coffee in the lengthy subtly peated finish."
4171,6,"Glenglassaugh has altered its policy of offering single cask expressions of its 40 year old and replaced these with a vatting of casks to provide an ongoing release program offered at cask strength and without chill filtration. The nose is pleasingly complex with ginger honey milk chocolate icing sugar sherry plums and new leather. Resinous on the palate with pineapple and brittle toffee then black coffee and aniseed. A spicy oakiness ultimately develops. Drying steadily in the finish with licorice and oak tannins. £1200"
4172,1,"For me Talisker 30 year olds have paled in comparison to the same distillery’s 20 and 25 year olds. This however immediately shows promise. Gold in color and while it’s another one that starts ever so slightly restrained the giveaway peppery note soon reveals itself as smoked pimento and Szechuan pepper mixed with extra virgin olive oil spread over hot smoked salmon. There’s also a touch of putty — something which you usually only see in youthful expressions — suggesting that here’s another refill maturation. 
As with many of these older whiskies water isn’t the best option for the palate but a drop does help release the sweet fruitiness that always lurks in Talisker’s heart this time accompanied by an herbal note (mint and fennel). It’s almost as if it is looking back at itself as an 18 year old but here the firm granitic grip of age takes hold.
The palate starts slowly but opens well with a gentle yet assertive revealing of the aromas on the nose. It seems to dip in energy just in the center before sparking back to life when the smoke emerges like the last flash of defiance from an old-timer."
4173,6,"Fire is the first Highland Park expression to be fully matured in “refill port wine-seasoned casks” and it carries a 15 year age statement. Very fruity on the nose—raspberries and prunes —plus lightly-smoked pineapple and vanilla. More smoky spicy fruit features on the palate with a light sprinkling of cinnamon. The peat dries to leave ashy licorice and black pepper in a lingering finish. The port is pleasingly discreet. (4938 bottles for the U.S.)"
4174,9,"Finished in Chateau d’Yquem casks and it shows. There’s a creamy honeyed sweetness and viscosity to this whisky that is very soothing. Bruichladdich’s brisk sea character cuts through the lightly syrup-like thickness and keeps the whisky fresh and lively while notes of golden raisin peaches lemon gum drops vanilla and coconut add complexity. Satisfying salty/sweet finish."
4175,9,"A marriage of Bruichladdich with three different peating levels. Devotees of young smoky Islay whiskies will enjoy this one. It is youthful and explosive with earthy peat smoke fish nets brine and kiln ash. All this is tamed beautifully by notes of vanilla wafer seductive malt marshmallow spiced peaches and pear."
4176,9,"This one is my favorite of the four distillery-bottled Bruichladdich whiskies reviewed here. It still quite lively and nicely balanced for such a mature whisky (and reminiscent of the previous 1970 vintage in this respect) with some floral notes and brine emerging from its fruity vanilla truffle nougat foundation. Still it maintains an air of lightness and freshness throughout with a pleasingly dry subtly spicy finish that lingers."
4195,6,"Bunnahabhain has been marketing batches of peated spirit under the Mòine banner since 2004 and this example is the first to have been fully matured in Bordeaux red wine casks. Damp peat sweet antiseptic and subtle raspberry aromas. Lots of red berry notes on the palate backed by milky coffee peat and vanilla. Black pepper and berry fruits in the smoky finish."
4177,1,"Deep amber. Big resinous and almost heathery with significant cask influence for a decade-old dram. The aroma is like a cobbler’s workshop: oils leather grease polish and then licorice. On the palate there’s the prune notes of armagnac the sweetness and cedar flavors of old rum and very Rothes-esque spiciness. Water just a drop lightens it a little allowing the underlying sweetness to show. Not cask dominated just bottled at exactly the right moment. Recommended. £68"
4178,9,"An unusual but very fine Bruichladdich with sweet chewy toffee notes I often associate with Speyside whiskies not Islay (although I have tasted a few older Bunnahabhain whiskies that were like this). Layers of marzipan and chocolate fudge also emerge and I even pick up some apple and black cherry fruit in the background. Bruichladdich's ""sea breeze"" freshness rises through the chewy sweetness and provides balance and complexity."
4179,9,"Soft and gentle (for Caol Ila that is) thanks to the 25 years of aging. Plenty of creamy vanilla and honey to go with the malty foundation along with coal tar licorice root and olive with a hint of brine juniper unsweetened dark chocolate and tobacco (cigars in a humidor?). Very nice. (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.)"
4180,6,"Cream vanilla and fresh orange juice feature on the early nose followed by a slightly herbal note. Ultimately sweet and floral with nougat. Luscious sweet orange notes on the palate with toasted cereal before dry wood spices appear. The finish is relatively long and nutty with a sprinkling of pepper."
4181,1,"This the fifth of TWE’s ongoing Elements bottlings of Islay’s legendary closed distillery does not disappoint. The nose is akin to salted chocolate with a wasabi-like earthiness lurking behind. Port Ellen’s characteristic flintiness is there in the form of rock-pools and hot sand inside seashells while the smoke hints at sphagnum moss marsh gas and burnt cake. The palate has touches of smoked eel and a hint of pear. As enigmatic as ever in other words. £175 (500 ml)"
4182,6,"A’bunadh is matured entirely in Spanish oak oloroso butts non-chill filtered and bottled at cask strength. This edition is very rich with dark berry notes on the nose hazelnuts caramel cinnamon and orange fondant creams. The palate is full and supple with polished oak honey new leather raisins prunes and a hint of cloves. Very long in the finish with plain chocolate black pepper fruity spices and oak."
4183,6,"As Arran continues on its trajectory toward introducing an 18 year old expression just 9000 bottles of sherry cask-matured 17 year old have been released. Bottled at 46% it has not been chill filtered. Sweet and fruity on the nose with ripe pineapples green apples malt and a hint of licorice. Luscious and nicely-textured on the palate. Lots of orchard fruits sherry and soft toffee. Mild spice and hedgerow fruitiness in the slightly drying lengthy finish."
4184,6,"This includes whisky distilled in 2006 2007 and 2008 and matured in a mixture of bourbon oloroso and virgin oak casks. Honey apple blossom ginger and nutmeg on the nose which then exhibits damp tweed and finally hot butter. Sweet on the full palate with milk chocolate honey ripe peaches almonds vanilla and caramel. Quite long in the finish with zesty apple notes."
4185,6,"A number of ‘Marrying Strength’ variants of 10 year old Springbank have been released retailing exclusively through the Cadenhead Whisky Shop in Campbeltown. The 2014 expression is bottled at 49.9%. Brine new leather and pipe tobacco on the nose with developing caramel. Maritime characteristics are accentuated with time. Voluptuous on the palate balanced with sweet leather peaty spices and apricots. Long and slowly drying in the finish with black pepper and rock salt. Quintessential Springbank and the best 10 year old sampled to date. £42"
4186,6,"Distilled in 2006 and aged for 11 years in a PX sherry hogshead (#310110). Peach blossom vanilla and icing sugar on the nose which becomes more floral in time. Smooth and very sweet on the substantial palate: canned pineapple in syrup malt and a sprinkling of cinnamon. Vibrant pineapple and sweet oak notes last to the very end of the lengthy finish. (234 bottles)"
4187,6,"Released in February 2015 this cask strength expression of 17 year old Springbank has been entirely matured in sherry casks. 9120 bottles are available globally. The nose offers sea spray blood orange ginger and discreet sherry. Finally some peat. The sherry really makes its presence felt on the palate which is full and slightly oily with rich fruitcake flavors soft toffee coffee and ripe cherries. The finish is lengthy slightly peaty with more sherry treacle toffee and trademark Springbank ozone."
4188,6,"Of the three Singleton bottlings Dufftown is aimed at European markets Glen Ord at Asia and Glendullan at the U.S. The oldest expression in the Singleton of Glendullan stable this boasts a nose of brittle toffee dried fruits and new leather. Nutty toffee drinking chocolate banana split and coconut on the smooth soft palate. Peppery almonds in the slowly drying finish. Good value for the money!"
4189,9,"One of the last remaining vintages from an Islay distillery which will be missed dearly. This is obviously from a sherry cask and the peat smoke sherry and oak-aging is married nicely here. It a brooding Port Ellen. Notes of peat fires fig kippers toffee vanilla and dry oak take turns entertaining the palate. Considering its age it isn’t excessively oaked and the Port Ellen character still shines through. If you’re going to track down a bottle of Port Ellen before they get really difficult to find this one is worth serious consideration."
4190,1,"Distilled in 2002 here’s Port Charlotte with an assured maturity. Amber in color with some smoke and a pleasing whiff of cowshed (sweet hay and cow’s breath) before rosehip syrup and ozonic freshness. Water brings out incense cream even a little nuttiness. The palate is gently complex; a drop of water is needed to calm the heat and reveal the smoke that interweaves between the layers. It retains its fresh acidic finish with nutmeg soft lemon and pear. Excellent. £110"
4191,6,"Named in honor of the family that owned Mortlach for many years this was matured in sherry wood like its 16 year old sibling. Milk chocolate nuts and coffee on the nose with developing meaty aromas. Soft and slightly waxy on the palate with almonds apricots and allspice. Milk chocolate and spicy orange in the finish."
4192,1,"Smoky! Can you get dessert seaweed? Because that’s what this smells of. Candied ginger notes alongside a distinct salinity—think winkles—and in time a hint of verjus even lanolin with water. The palate shows balanced smoke paprika then white pepper. The best smoky Bunna’ I’ve come across showing maturity balance and no rubberiness. In time there’s notes of old (refill) sherry cask. Released for the 2014 London Whisky Show but still commercially available. £75"
4193,6,"The youngest of the 2018 Mortlach trio this is named after the distillery’s famous small spirit still. Maturation has taken place in sherry and bourbon casks. Baked apricots and ginger on the nose with black pepper lots of milk chocolate and an herbal note. The palate is mildly savory with more milk chocolate vanilla orchard fruits and cinnamon. Lingering chocolate ginger in the finish."
4198,9,"A limited edition of 2000 bottles. Thick and syrupy on the palate accentuated with vanilla and shortbread. You’ll also find pleasing peaches & cream zingy citrus fruit along with a hint of nuts spice and a pinch of salt on the palate. A nice addition to the 14 year old distillery bottling. Kudos for bottling it at cask strength."
4199,6,"This expression replaces the previous 17 year old and has been aged in bourbon and second-fill American oak casks followed by a period in first-fill Spanish oak oloroso butts. Sherry is immediately obvious on the nose with fresh-baked fruitcake aromas honey and allspice. The palate is sweet and spicy with Jaffa orange segments dipped in sea salt toffee and dark chocolate. Orange and oak in the medium-length finish."
4200,6,"This is a recent addition to the portfolio and has been matured in a mixture of thirteen American oak butts and hogsheads. These have given an out-turn of 893 bottles. Freshly-grated ginger white pepper and melons on the nose. Soft fruit and spices feature on the palate with honey and coconut oil plus background peat smoke. Lively spices soft oak and hazelnuts in the finish."
4201,6,"Distilled in 2006 this was filled into a virgin French oak cask (#310865) and bottled at cask strength after 11 years. Peaches and apricots on the early nose with a hint of cloves. Ultimately very floral with vanilla fudge. The palate yields zesty orchard fruits malt and ginger. Remaining fruity in the long finish with black pepper and juicy oak. (286 bottles)"
4202,6,"The ninth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition series was matured fully in American oak barrels that previously contained rye whiskey. A reticent early nose: melon and a hint of lemon then warm oily cereal notes and honey develop. Initially fruity on the palate with ripe banana then slightly earthy with nutty spice and cocoa powder. Zesty spices in the finish drinking chocolate and youthful oak."
4203,6,"Distilled in 2014 from barley grown at Octomore Farm with a peating level of 194 ppm and aged 5 years in barrels from Buffalo Trace Heaven Hill Jack Daniel and Jim Beam. There’s a maritime note and prickly ginger on the nose with a bit of smoke and a hint of cloves. Sinuous on the palate with sweet cereal big spicy peat and dark chocolate. The long finish yields ashy peat and chocolate-covered ginger. (18000 bottles)"
4204,9,"Fresh and quite aromatic. Nice interplay between soothing malty sweetness and honest “naked” Caol Ila notes (in the sense that all the classic Caol Ila flavors are exposed-leafy smoke tarry rope salt & pepper spice seaweed and olive). An evolving whisky with a phenolic briny crescendo that lingers. Nicely done."
4205,9,"Pale gold color. Aromas and flavors of peat smoke seaweed lemon grass olives and green peppercorns. Medium bodied and slightly oily in texture. Long dry peat smoke finish. Caol Ila is an Islay dram that Laphroaig Lagavulin and Bowmore fans must become acquainted with. Although distllery bottlings are not available here in the U.S. many independent bottlers offer it. This expression is young vibrant and exciting."
4206,9,"Older Springbanks are becoming hard to find and this one won't disappoint. It is packed with citrus notes (lemon orange) often found in whiskies over 30 years old. Along with them you'll find subtle spice notes (especially cinnamon) red licorice polished oak and that signature Springbank fresh brininess albeit a bit reserved. This Springbank is not as heavily sherried as some other older bottlings that have come and gone. If I wanted to be picky I would like to see more of the Springbank briny zest and freshness here but giving its age it is understandably reserved. This whisky's best feature is how surprisingly clean rounded and polished it is for 33 years old. Very nice."
4207,9,"Finished in cognac wood. The cognac wood influence might dominate other whiskies but the Coal Ila is big enough for challenge. If anything it seems to contribute a silky elegance to what would otherwise be a brooding bare-knuckled whisky;. It works nicely. Notes of germinating barley vanilla cream grape preserve and peat bonfire with a salty smoky finish. (Available in the Chicago area.)"
4208,6,"Distilled at Glen Garioch when peated barley was still being used this 1991 vintage is quite reticent on the nose considering its strength. Subtle malt and fudge notes plus a hint of wood smoke. Fresh fruits and a sherbet ‘zing’ on the palate with a suggestion of treacle. Developing spicy smokiness. Fruitiness is emphasized when water is added. The ‘zing’ — now ginger — lasts to the end of the medium-length finish with advancing discreet oak. (Only 120 bottles for the U.S.)"
4209,6,"Part of Distell’s Malt Collection this 19 year old offering of Tobermory Distillery’s peated spirit was finished in Pedro Ximénez sherry casks for an unspecified period. The nose yields smoky caramel raisins and coal soot. Full-bodied with blackcurrant toffee hot asphalt and black pepper. Black pepper peat and chewy oak in the medium-length finish."
4210,1,"A very welcome arrival from new owners Ian MacLeod this has been aged in sherry
wood. As a result you can’t help comparing it to Macallan and while there’s
none of the oily depths there are fragrant top notes of honey and apple before
some resin and warm leather develop but no sulfur. Some of the richness is
lost with water so I’d leave it as is. This is a stunner for a 10 year old and
is marked accordingly. Value Pick £34"
4211,6,"After 10 years maturing in bourbon casks this expression from the 2018 Distell Malt Collection was then aged for a further 2 years in fino sherry hogsheads. The nose offers white wine sultanas ginger and cocoa powder plus white chocolate and tangerines. The palate is full with sweet orchard fruits ginger and cinnamon balanced by dry sherry. The finish is medium in length with black pepper and cocoa. (1710 bottles)"
4212,6,"Matured in European oak butts this 1998 single malt has a nose of soft toffee vanilla and orchard fruits. The palate is very full and sweet even sugary with baked apples peaches in cream and cinnamon. Medium to long in the finish with fruity oak lingering ginger and pepper. (5352 bottles)"
4213,9,"Even with a refill sherry cask bright fruit is the main theme to this whisky: strawberry-rhubarb pie red raspberry preserve red currant. But there’s honeyed malt for balance along with suggestions of
coconut macaroon marzipan brine and glazed ginger to keep things interesting. Distinctive. (U.S. exclusive)"
4214,6,"2011 saw the first expression of Rosebank appear in Diageo’s annual Special Releases series and just 5604 bottles are available worldwide. The bottling is comprised of whisky matured in refill American oak and refill European oak casks. Floral and mildly herbal on the nose with cereal and tropical fruit notes along with a hint of damp soil. The palate is somewhat tart with oranges and pepper while the finish dries to coffee and spicy oak. A lovely example of a much-mourned malt."
4502,9,"The newest expression from the 1990s. Heavier richer and more ripe that the 1987 Vintage reviewed above. It is very creamy and mouth-coating with layers of sweetness (vanilla caramel light toffee white chocolate) fruit (sultana plum) along with a good underpinning of oak spice. A very nice effort for a whisky this young."
4215,9,"Deep amber color. Mature aroma-this is definitely an old whisky -with complex wood spices (cedar vanilla mint caramel) and soft ripe fruit. Medium bodied and soft. Surprisingly balanced on the palate with an incredible depth and maturity. Its flavors are similar to its aroma but a soft sweetness compliments the flavors and provides balance. Soothing mellowing finish of considerable depth."
4216,9,"Younger Tomintoul whiskies are fairly straightforward unassuming whiskies. Older expressions show more depth. What they all seem to have is a remarkable balance. Moreover this whisky and its predecessor the 27 year old are surprisingly delicate and nimble for their age. This is an elegant whisky with a toffee foundation creamy vanilla nougat light summer fruits a kiss of molasses and gentle spice (cinnamon mocha). Soft finish. Very pleasing."
4217,6,"A U.S.-exclusive variant of this popular Islay single malt. Lemon juice and warm granite on the nose backed by sweet heather ginger and developing Jaffa orange medicinal peat and charcuterie. Mouth-coating and initially sweet before darker berry notes emerge. Savory saline and smoky. Medium-length in the finish with lingering peat smoke and spicy oak."
4218,9,"This whisky shows no signs of immaturity considering its age. Indeed enjoying Laphroaig young and at a higher strength is the best way to appreciate the distillery’s true character. Very medicinal and “closed up” neat but comes alive with a splash of water. Powerful notes of tar charcoal smoked seaweed and licorice root mercifully tamed by ripe barley and honeyed malt laced with vanilla. Warm smoky charred oak finish. (U.S. only)"
4219,9,"More subtle and teasing. Not as much a knock-out punch on the finish like the Talisker 10 and 18 but rather more steady intense blows to the abdomen for many rounds. An aging Talisker but still with many redeeming qualities. It is drier than its younger siblings with less fruit and more of a stony texture with dried spices and lingering leather notes. This whisky requires more patience and demands more concentration but it is still rewarding to the seasoned aficionado (with some extra pocket change)."
4220,1,"It’s a crying shame that this great distillery is so rarely seen. Here a bourbon cask has reduced the meatiness and amplified the fruity component but these are fruits with depth and power allied to dried flowers. The mango-like sweetness is reduced to syrup; there’s light plum jam and some old paper. Sweet on the tongue with crystallized ginger apricot and a finish of spice and the strange sweetness of licorice root. (The Whisky Exchange only.) £84"
4221,6,"Rich on the nose with stewed fruit butterscotch and soft spices. Very smooth palate delivery with luscious fruit flavors: baked apples and peaches in syrup then cinnamon and ginger. The medium-length finish features ebbing spice and developing milk chocolate. Likely sourced from Tullibardine Distillery."
4222,6,"To create Fired Oak Glen Moray spirit has been matured in bourbon casks for almost a decade before a 10 month finish in heavily charred virgin American oak casks. Canned pineapple honey and vanilla on the nose with a hint of lemon. An initial citric zest on the palate then soft toffee newly sawn timber cloves and cinnamon. Licorice lively spices and slightly smoky oak in the medium-length finish. £40"
4223,6,"Distilled in 1999 this single malt was aged in refill American oak hogsheads and refill American oak barrels. Pineapple and walnuts figure on the early nose which becomes more floral ultimately offering violets. The palate is full and fruity majoring in peaches in syrup with new-mown hay and white pepper. Nicely balanced and rounded with buttery notes emerging. The finish dries slowly with subtle licorice."
4224,6,"A peated malt from Loch Lomond this vintage expression spent 25 years in refill bourbon barrels. A delicate mildly smoky nose with vanilla gentle spice black pepper and a subtle medicinal characteristic. Soft and fruity on the palate with encroaching earthiness and dry peat smoke. The smoke lingers in the lengthy finish with vanilla aniseed and spicy slightly tannic oak."
4225,1,"A very tarry start like fence posts which have just been treated with creosote. Add in some smoked fish alongside dried grass and you have all the requisite elements for a classic Laphroaig. The palate is massively smoky to start a real peat bomb but that eruption recedes allowing barley and sweetness to come through. This is a serious dram which needs water to coat the tongue. Very good. £65/500 ml"
4226,9,"Gold color. Aromas of citrus fruit (lemons tangerines) and a pot pourri of spices-very fragrant. Appetizing flavors of citrus fruit exotic spices along with a slightly briny peppery finish."
4227,9,"Mahogany color. Full-bodied thick and chewy. Incredibly rich aroma and flavors of toffee fudge spice cake ripe fruit burnished leather and oak. Nicely balanced throughout with a long satisfying finish."
4228,2,"Peated notes galore—peat embers iodine Band-Aid lime juice smoked meats smoked paprika and dried leaves on the nose and palate. Flavors of dark chocolate and coffee start to emerge as the peat yields to dessert notes of crème brûlée cooked pears and butterscotch ending with a fleeting hint of charcoal embers. An impressive debut for this new distillery from the Isle of Skye showing the promise of great things to come."
4229,9,"A graceful Talisker. Soft toffee and caramel with balanced gentle fruit. Hints of boat dock wood damp peat and fish nets. Warming spice notes (anise pepper and salt) provide intrigue and linger on through a warming spicy finish. Well rounded with enough depth on the palate to make up for the lack of punch in younger expressions."
4230,9,"A thick sweet weighty Lagavulin -- the kind you eat with a fork. Interwoven caramel and molasses laced with thumping waxed fruit dates burnt walnuts and peat kiln embers that linger long on the palate. A mouthful!"
4231,6,"At cask strength this Clynelish represents House Tyrell. Split green wood followed by marshmallows on the floral nose; increasingly sweet with a hint of cloves. The palate immediately offers classic Clynelish waxiness with tropical fruits honey and subtle smoke. Licorice black pepper and citrus fruits in the medium to long finish."
4232,9,"Finished in sauternes wood. I really love how the appetizing notes of Pulteney marry with the sweet notes of the sauternes wine cask. Light-medium in body but good viscosity. Fresh brine throughout with honey-drenched melon fruit pineapple in syrup citrus and a hint of cotton candy and lightly toasted marshmallow. A delicious marriage of two high-caliber drinks categories."
4233,6,"Distilled in 2004 this expression was finished for 2 years in amontillado sherry-seasoned hogsheads. Soft and floral on the delicate nose with vanilla ice cream and ripe pears. Smooth on the palate with malt milk chocolate honey nuts and red apples. Drying in the spicy finish with black coffee and light wood tannins. £120"
4234,9,"Soothing vanilla cream with additional notes of spice cake coconut marshmallow tiramisu fresh cut grass and a hint of evergreen. A true ""comfort"" whisky. Just don’t add any water because it will fall flat. This whisky is great just the way it is."
4235,6,"A veteran Dalwhinnie matured in refill hogsheads and butts. The nose is floral with honeysuckle marshmallows almonds ginger and green fruit in time. The palate is creamy and offers quite insistent spices with sweet orange fondant notes more honey and cocoa. Medium in length spicy with persistent orange and milk chocolate in the finish plus just a wisp of smoke. (7586 bottles) £500"
4236,6,"Distilled in 2000 this expression has been aged in freshly charred American oak hogsheads. Tangerines ginger and white pepper on the nose with developing nutmeg. Big sweet fruit notes on the palate with milk chocolate and caramel. Tangy citrus fruit and dark chocolate in the spicy warming finish. (600 bottles for the U.S.)"
4237,9,"Deep gold color. Very bold aroma of toffee dark chocolate diesel fuel-soaked soil smoldering campfire coal tar clove leather fig and dark berried fruit. More of the same on the palate with seaweed smoked haddock and cough drops emerging towards the finish. This whisky is very dynamic and exciting to drink. My only criticism: it comes across a little green on the finish which keeps me from scoring it in the 90s. Still it’s pretty impressive considering how young some of the whiskies in it are. If you like your Islay whiskies young and brooding this one’s for you."
4238,10,"Lush caramel red apples sanded oak and olive oil first pressings with herbal overtones this ancient grain has managed to retain its distinctive character. The palate is initially mouth-drawing with an oily structure the flavors are a pleasing tangle of caramelized apple toffee and sultana with a noticeably long finish. Banish any notion you might have of adding water right now. It’s welcoming to have a great aged grain unafraid to show its true colors. (248 bottles)"
4239,6,"Aged in first-fill sherry butts this cask strength vintage from Gordon & MacPhail features a nose which opens with savory ginger becoming more fragrant plus vanilla fudge and warm leather. Oily in the mouth with ripe cherries sweet spices pipe tobacco and new leather. Nutty and slightly earthy. Citrus fruit dry spicy peat and black pepper in the finish."
4240,6,"This “single field single vintage single malt” was distilled in 2013 from Islay barley peated to 114 ppm and aged in first-fill American whiskey barrels. The nose offers sweet fragrant woodsmoke from logs on an open fire with milk chocolate salted caramel and orange. The fragrant smoke carries over on the palate with pears melons and developing barley sugar. Dark peat and licorice in the finish. (24000 bottles)"
4241,9,"The oldest whisky ever bottled by Glenfarclas. Fortunately Glenfarclas ages very nicely. This whisky proves my point. It is very complex with notes of burnished leather roasted nuts fruit cake toffee apples sultana damp peat and sappy oak. A very soothing whisky with the depth and maturity one hopes for in a whisky this old. Only 110 bottles produced and only 18 destined for the U.S."
4242,1,"Amber in color and again some fresh fruitiness this time mixed with a little cereal. The same dry grass you get on the 1981 but here there’s a nutty biscuity edge above that meaty solidity. The palate shows slight oiliness and roasted red pepper that changes into blackberry as it opens. Needs roughly the same amount of water to open fully which also brings out chamois leather and then barley sugar sweets. Clean but rich — that’s Glenfarclas. (A U.S. exclusive.)"
4243,1,"A vatting of different ages of Glenfiddich (the youngest being 14 years old) aged in American oak then married in virgin American oak casks on which folk from the States had written their hopes and dreams…Awww! Deliciously fruity and clean it’s all pear juice crème brûlée fudge cool mint and dessert apple. With water there’s dusty cinnamon kiwi and milk chocolate. The oak acts as a smoothing base for this fruitiness. A lovely idea and a lovely whisky."
4244,9,"Soothing and seamless on the nose and palate with chewy toffee molasses nougat almond butter vanilla fudge cinnamon spice and nutmeg along with gentle tobacco notes emerging later on the palate. A pleasing dry finish offsets the sweeter notes. A delicious whisky from beginning to end."
4245,6,"This is part of the distiller’s Extremely Rare range and has been matured in bourbon casks for 15 years before a third is transferred to oloroso sherry casks for 3 years. Dried fruits icing sugar honey lemon cheesecake and floral aromas on the nutty nose. The palate offers figs crème brûlée cinnamon more honey and citrus fruit. The finish sees citrus fruit and oak merge nicely."
4246,9,"Amber gold color. Surprisingly smoky aroma balanced nicely with mature oak notes roasted nuts tobacco and malty sweetness in the background. Firm body. Delicious flavors of toasted oak roasted nuts smoke leather and malt. The flavors are interwoven nicely with great balance. Satisfying finish."
4247,1,"Longmorn may be slightly better known but it’s still pretty much a cult whisky — with a huge following in Japan where every whisky bar seems to have multiple expressions. This bottling shows it in its lushest guise with masses of caramelized soft fruits banana cream toffee and chocolate. The palate shifts between raisin and plum. Elegant."
4248,9,"There have been several lovely older expressions of Bunnahabhain over the past decade and this is one of them. The vanilla cream and toffee nuttiness is balanced perfectly by polished oak bright fruit (apricot sultana cherry pits) and subtle anise. There’s a calming quality to this whisky that is very more-ish. All the maturity of an older whisky without the tired dominating oak."
4249,6,"Some of the first peated spirit produced in the late 1990s at Tobermory Distillery has gone into this bottling which has been finished in marsala wine casks. The nose yields earthy malt new leather printer’s ink and a final fragrant note. Big bright flavors of orchard fruits and sweet peat on the palate plus black pepper and dessert wine. Ashy peat burnt oak and lingering pepperiness in the finish."
4250,6,"An inviting and complex nose of honey orchard fruits apple blossom rosewater and subtle cinnamon. Rich and creamy in the mouth with initially intensely sweet fruit and spice notes followed by ginger toffee and vanilla. The finish is warming gently spicy and medium in length. Diageo Special Releases 2016 bottling. (4932 bottles)"
4251,1,"Funny to think how recently Caol Ila was an Islay giant that was kept pretty much under wraps by its owner. These days it has cemented its reputation as the island’s Mr. Consistent. This version shows its character the best a nose that mixes seashore and grass with a distinct hint of smoked bacon. The peatiness isn’t dominant but flows throughout the palate scenting lifting and subtly changing the mix. A delicious oiliness makes it a great food whisky."
4252,1,"Remember those remarkable 20+ year old BenRiachs that appeared when the distillery reopened which we thought were gone forever? Think again. This new and keenly priced arrival has sweet malt on the nose followed by mango orange blossom honey and Portuguese custard tarts. It needs a little water to calm the alcohol and help to spread an already thick texture along the tongue. A sweetly spicy and creamy hit toward the end. Marked within its competitive set. £60"
4253,1,"The Craigellachies just keep on coming. This the oldest of the new Original Bottling range is the most fiercely priced. It shows balanced and slightly restrained mature notes—think of candle wax and waxed leather. Some fruit syrups clementine and honey then follow. The palate is thick—the distillery’s worm tubs having an effect—giving floral accents and a hint of barbecued pineapple. Not the heaviest of the range but delicious. (Travel Retail exclusive) £500"
4254,6,"Mellow on the nose even at cask strength with vanilla lemon curd honey and warm ginger cookies. Strawberry jam notes emerge in time. An initial flavor of berry on the palate then malt honey and slightly bitter oak. The finish features black pepper more ginger and jam-like notes. (2400 bottles for U.S.)"
4255,6,"The latest addition to the Tomintoul range this is exclusive to the U.S. and is finished in port-style wine casks from Kedem Winery in New York. Sweet on the nose with slightly spicy red wine notes followed by strawberries and cream. The palate is smooth and creamy with red cherries cinnamon and dark chocolate. Spicy in the finish with ginger cookies and cherry brandy-filled liqueur chocolates. (12000 bottles)"
4256,1,"Cragganmore is a deep malt but its richness is often obscured by its fruity sweetness. A period in port pipes allows this element to be amplified. The black currant is now fully fruited and acts as a flavor bridge while the meatiness that sits underneath and often unseen is revealed. Think cherry pipe tobacco clove and dark fruits. Sweet but not too sweet and always identifiably Cragganmore. For me the pick of the bunch."
4257,6,"Subtle on the nose with orchard fruit barley honey and vanilla becoming more fragrant in time. Quite full-bodied overtly fruity with orange rind red apples malt and cocoa powder. Fruit persists in the grassy finish. The higher strength makes this a standout among the Tomintouls."
4258,6,"This 17 year old independent bottling of Ben Nevis has somewhat unusually been matured in a fino sherry cask rather than the more common oloroso or PX.   The nose offers initial milk chocolate notes then a whiff of cold roast pork and oak. In time strawberry and mango aromas appear. The mouthfeel is pleasingly full decidedly gingery with caramel and dry sherry. Spicy mild sherry and raisins in a long lively finish."
4259,6,"Released in 2017 to replace the well-regarded 27 year old this Tomintoul presents a nose of malt and gentle spice with lemon drizzle cake. Medium-bodied on the palate very sweet with brittle toffee honey sultanas wood spice and black tea with sugar. Vanilla licorice allspice and subtle oak in the finish."
4260,1,"Unusually named—it refers to the price paid for the distillery—here is Glenfarclas in slightly lighter guise than usual. Fresh and clean at the start with hints of sweet nut and soft cooked fruits; subtly sherried elements then begin to come through. The palate is balanced with supple tannins and a dark depth to the mid-palate. Those sweet fruits in the nose continue all the way through. Refined and rather lovely. £85"
4261,9,"A marriage of 3 and 4 year old whisky aged in first-fill bourbon barrels with the 4 year old portion being finished in oloroso sherry casks. Among the best of the Kilchoman releases to date. The first-fill bourbon packs a flavor punch while the sherry softens rounds and adds complexity. Barrel char burnt raisin boat dock and tarry rope softened by caramel and enhanced with notes of tropical fruit. Surprisingly mature for its age and very distinctive."
4262,9,"Finished in a rum cask. Gently sweet (caramel vanilla cream kiss of honey) with balancing fruit (lime kiwi green grape) and spice (white pepper brine). Youthful (but not immature). Invigorating briny finish. I don’t know what kind of rum cask was used but it comes across more like sugar cane juice-based rhum agricole than the molasses-based rums. Very nice! (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
4263,9,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Amber Aroma: Rich and rather full for Glenlivet with nuts and fruit drenched with layers of toffee and caramel. Palate: Rich and enveloping-almost chewy-with notes of toffee and caramel up front. Delicate fruit nuts and spice emerge mid-palate adding complexity becoming dry with a long spicy finish"
4264,9,"Very stylish. Quite refined too with notes of vanilla peaches and flowering currant. The whisky is very soft on the palate delicate and almost bashful at times. Indeed it may take a couple of dates with this whisky for it to fully to reveal itself. The whisky finishes toasty with a pleasing cereal grain maltiness. Some whiskies are great after dinner; others make wonderful pre-dinner drams. This one is great anytime."
4265,9,"New packaging and new whisky too-sort of. According to Glenlivet’s whisky maker Jim Cryle Archive is now being bottled in smaller batches allowing them to be more selective in the casks used to improve its quality and flavor. I believe that it has worked. It tastes more refined. Along with Archive’s signature creamy toffee notes I’m picking up beautiful floral vanilla and fruity notes (peaches pineapple coconut) on the nose and palate with subtler nutty anise threads throughout. An elegant expression of Glenlivet."
4266,6,"Milsean is the latest Private Edition release from Glenmorangie. After initial bourbon barrel maturation the whisky spent several years in heavily-toasted Portuguese red wine casks. Fresh fruits on the early nose with ginger and a hint of musk. Coconut and icing sugar emerge. Smooth and rounded on the palate with a big fruit hit that becomes more citric in time plus lively oak spices. Lingering in the finish with persistent spice. Finally plain chocolate and chili."
4267,9,"Lovely bouquet of dried citrus fruit honeyed apricot and plum complemented by exotic wood spice malty vanilla and a hint of mint and anise. Similar follow-through on the palate with the sweeter notes up front full fruit impact mid-palate leading to a dry peppery exotic wood spice finish. The whisky evolves on the palate and is very impressive with its only blemish being a bit too dry and oaky on the finish."
4268,1,"Here Craigellachie is slimmed down and appears in slightly leaner guise with an aromatic spritz of vetiver-heavy male cologne coming across first before fresh fruits follow on. More crisp and with slightly more obvious toasted structure. The pineapple distillery character is now dried before the palate shows sweet chocolate pudding char honeysuckle herbs and white fruits. A classy (and large) package. (Travel Retail only) €135/liter"
4269,1,"Initially this is Macallan in effusive Willy Wonka mood with lots of toffee chocolate greengage and light oiliness. The aroma thickens with water and with it a more serious mien: brogues buffed to a high sheen. The palate is equally rich and layered with cereal black cherry discreet oak. A complex mix as befits a gentleman’s dram that every gentleman should have. £95"
4503,6,"Made from the same recipe as previous Peat Week bottlings with the name referring to the one week per year Balvenie distills peated whisky. Stone fruits lightly smoked in a peat kiln on the early nose new leather and honey. Sweet peat smoke orchard fruits and soft spices on the palate. The fruits darken in the finish with licorice and spicy oak. (18000 bottles)"
4270,6,"The latest addition to the Jura range has been matured in American white oak casks before spending three years in Gonzalez Byass oloroso sherry butts. The mellow nose is lightly oily with figs sherry orange and a savory note. Vanilla emerges along with malt and finally a hint of cinnamon and parma violets. Soft and supple on the palate with more orange plus cocoa sultanas and dates. The finish is lengthy and features dark chocolate raisins aniseed and subtle spices."
4271,1,"Immediately identifiably Longmorn: that ridiculous highly amenable mix of soft fruits masses of sweet spice candied peels coconut and sticky toffee pudding. In fact it’s almost over the top in its lushness. Leans into the mouth with masses of mace then soft fruits and marzipan develop. Unctuous long and ripe the wood shows just a little but the depth and richness holds it in check. Very good. £97"
4272,1,"Aged in first-fill American oak this shows a real brightness crisp fruit and some smoke—it’s not really unpeated—and wet grass before moving into pear and tarragon. The palate is intense with a hay note then an almost fino sherry-like note before sashimi emerges. Reduced there’s more of a soft flow though there’s still a touch of green olive minerality. A steal at this price. Snap it up."
4273,6,"Distilled at a time when the future of the distillery looked bleak. It is non-chill filtered and mildly herbal on the nose with soft peat muted iodine and a sprinkling of pepper plus warm leather. The palate is initially peppery then vanilla and green apples emerge along with aniseed and rich peat. Peppery to the end with a hint of iodine and coal smoke."
4274,6,"WK209 is named after a steam herring drifter registered in the Caithness port of Wick where Old Pulteney is distilled. This limited edition travel retail exclusive was matured entirely in first fill European oak sherry casks for 8 to 10 years. Milk chocolate crème brûlée old leather and sherry on the nose contrasting with brine. Sherry dried fruits black pepper English mustard and sea salt on the full palate. Spicy sherry heather and black coffee in the luxurious finish. €50"
4275,1,"Matured in refill European oak sherry butts this year’s Special Release has more weight than many previous expressions and a fascinating smokiness that comes across like a just-lit fire: fire lighter burning paper fire grate and wood smoke. The more active oak adds walnut skin notes and rich dried fruits before the smoke returns. All very sophisticated with enough sweetness to balance. Excellent but ouch that price!"
4276,6,"This cask strength 29 year old 1982 expression in the Wemyss Malts range is the company’s first bottling of a single malt distilled at the Northern Highland distillery of Teaninich. Just 201 bottles have been released. The insistently fruity nose features overripe pears heather in bloom soft fudge salted popcorn cinnamon and ginger. Soft and peachy on the palate with darker spice notes walnuts and plain chocolate. The finish is lengthy with more plain chocolate and some spiced oak. £110"
4277,6,"Freshly polished oak walnuts damsons vanilla and orange blossom are present on the nose. The slightly oily and peppery palate features sweet sherry more vanilla nutmeg then black currants and raisins. Prunes drying oak and black coffee in the medium-length finish. A very solid Highlander for lovers of sherry cask maturation. (298 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
4278,12,"Saline smoke seaweed and iodine mingle with biscuity shortbread lemon bubble gum bright berry fruit and wafting floral aromas. The palate glides silkily from lemon orange and soapy-floral flavors to almonds hazelnuts drying oak and hints of ginger with peat smoke and salt weaving throughout. Sweet then bitter on the finish showcasing cigar ash leather and polished oak. Actor Nick Offerman who collaborated with the distillery on this single malt could hardly be described as reticent but his whisky has a sweet shyness that works well in the glass"
4279,6,"The nose offers apricots honey vanilla nutmeg orange juice and a hint of mint. Jaffa orange black banana licorice and chimney soot on the palate. Licorice lingers with an herbal note and tannic oak in the finish. (51 bottles for the U.S.)"
4280,9,"For those of you drinking whisky long enough it was a Glenmorangie Tain L’Hermitage 1978 Vintage that kick-started this whole exotic finish trend by Glenmorangie about 10 years ago. That one wasn’t sold here in the U.S. but this one is (although this one costs about four times as much as the original one did when it was released). Both were racked in used bourbon barrels before being finished in Hermitage red wine casks from northern Rhone. The best of these limited release Glenmorangies like the Fino Sherry Finish expression several years ago add complexity and intrigue without masking Glenmorangie’s lovely subtle complexity. This one does a pretty good job of it although there’s a lot of fruit here (an obvious contribution of the wine). Complex fruit with notes of plum raspberry nectarine blueberries and a hint of lemon. Underneath the fruit there’s nougat dark chocolate and cocoa. Towards the finish the whisky becomes nicely dry with oak lingering on the palate."
4281,1,"Not an unpeated Ardbeg but a new initiative to raise money for the Kildalton Project which supports community projects in south Islay. Smoke but also real sweetness: hothouse peaches mezcal smoked oyster sphagnum moss a huge hit of vetiver and coal tar. The smoke flies to the throat before fogging forward while the sweet core (with added raspberry and cream and mint) moves to the back. A worthwhile dram and a hugely worthwhile cause. Buy for either reason; or both. £120"
4282,1,"Bere is an ancient strain of barley which is stubbornly difficult to grow and mash. For this Bruichladdich has gone to a specialist farm on Orkney. The nose is intriguingly aromatic sweet and slightly corn-like with a sweet nuttiness behind. It becomes very floral (night-scented stocks) with white currant lemon sherbet and a lift of tangerine before water brings out sakura (cherry blossom) syrup and bread. The palate is very sweet and concentrated. Remarkable. Keep watching. £52"
4283,6,"The initial nose is herbaceous with green apples then brittle toffee. Developing Juicy Fruit gum flavors. The palate is straightforward but full and pleasing featuring pineapple fudge vanilla and almonds. The finish is medium in length nutty with a hint of black pepper. (Cask no. 263; 176 bottles)"
4284,6,"This was distilled in February 1996 matured in a second-fill bourbon barrel and bottled in April 2017. The nose yields nectarines vanilla ice cream fudge and milk chocolate. Smooth and rounded on the palate with ripe apples toffee walnuts and ultimately a hint of lemon plus black pepper. Nutty and subtly spicy in the lengthy finish. (156 bottles)"
4285,9,"Many of the independent H.P. bottlings are aged in bourbon casks and like this one exhibit creamy vanilla honeyed malt and citrus. I’m also picking up some more subtle heather brine coconut and nougat. This one is clean on the palate and shows nice balance with enough dry oak on the finish to counter the whisky’s sweeter notes. (A D&M Wines & Liquors exclusive.)"
4286,1,"Rich amber. A slight agricultural note to start and although sweet and soft also a little indistinct. This is a palate whisky with plenty of integrated smoke rich fruitcake and as its name suggests plenty of chocolate. It fades quickly when neat. Water surprisingly rectifies this: the nose opens to show complex dark depths while the palate is lengthened and given extra aromatic lift. Rich and rather lovely. £85"
4287,6,"The latest release in Auchentoshan’s 1970s Vintage Series is this expression distilled on October 22 1979 and matured in first-fill oloroso sherry butts for 32 years. Just 1000 bottles are available (12 bottles for the U.S.). Sweet on the nose with furniture polish digestive biscuits cinnamon and a faint whiff of old leather. Big tropical fruit notes open the palate soon turning to smoky blackcurrants tea and rich fruit loaf. The finish is spicy featuring black pepper tobacco dark berries and plain chocolate."
4288,6,"Described by its distillers as “the most intensified expression” of Glen Grant this was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels and is non-chill filtered. The nose is fresh and floral with rose petals Turkish delight and cinnamon. Supple on the palate clean and fruity with developing soft toffee pear drops ginger and a floral carryover from the nose. The finish is medium in length with slightly astringent oak."
4289,6,"This is the first batch of the only cask-strength bottling in the lineup and was matured in a combination of American oak Pedro Ximénez oloroso and virgin oak casks. The nose offers gingersnap melon and cocoa powder becoming floral in time. Bright fresh fruits on the palate notably apricot and mango with honey. Drying slowly with a sprinkling of black pepper. (2400 bottles for U.S.)"
4290,6,"This expression is described by the distillers as “the heart of our range.” Matured in virgin oak Pedro Ximénez and oloroso casks. Oily on the nose with ripe banana and a hint of oak. Quite full-bodied and slick on the palate with vanilla honey and almonds. Milk chocolate and lime in the medium-length finish."
4291,9,"It's nice to see Gordon & MacPhail bottlings at strengths higher than 40% and it makes this already hefty whisky even more so. It is fragrant (with subtle heather notes) rich and malty (and quite thick in texture) with notes of honey and vanilla. Interwoven fruit (sultana along with subtle lemon and orange) add complexity. All this sweetness is rounded out nicely with a long dry oaky/spicy finish. A delicious evolving whisky. (Bottled exclusively for Binny's Beverage Depot.)"
4292,6,"Distilled in 2008 from 100 percent Scottish barley peated to 167 ppm. It spent 8 years in first-fill American oak casks. Peaches dipped in hot plain chocolate and tarry peat on the fragrant nose. The palate offers sweet creamy orchard fruits and honey backed by citrus-laden peat. Drying in the finish to quite a bitter tannic smokiness. (42000 bottles)"
4293,1,"A mélange of casks and techniques that only Jim McEwan knows about. The fourth iteration of his Black Art manages to mix mature notes of beeswax-burnished church pews a sprinkling of rose water dried mango rosehip syrup and potpourri. The palate opens to Parma violets underpinned with light lavender where fleshiness mingles with the exotic notes of manuka honey pomegranate apricot pits and dried lemon. It pushes malt into a new area but that’s the point. £200"
4294,6,"This 26 year old single cask Glengoyne was matured in a first-fill European oak sherry butt that yielded 339 bottles. It offers a nose of sultanas figs and vanilla plus white pepper and a hint of linseed. Succulent in the mouth the palate yields sweet sherry honey and contrasting lemon juice and pepper. The finish is lengthy but dries rapidly with lively pepper oak tannins and a final fatty note. £350"
4295,6,"Rather than the customary bourbon cask this was aged in refill European oak butts. The nose is delicate with brittle toffee vibrant orange pineapple and a hint of barley. Mellow and fruity on the palate with apricots soft toffee and table salt. Gingery oak and cocoa in the lengthy slightly minty finish."
4296,7,"If you needed proof that Scotch whiskies don’t fit neatly into established categories look no further than this marine style peated Highland malt. Sea salt oyster shells and light smoke lead the nose with hay and apricot underneath. In the entry the flavors burst on the palate with sea salt honey malt oak and smoke. Peat smoke really builds in the mid-palate but manages not to lose the supporting flavors although it becomes the real star of a long finish. (U.S. only)"
4297,9,"Interestingly this whisky was bottled in 2005 but not released until the end of 2008. (The brand manager tells me that they wanted to wait until the stocks of the current 1980s vintage (a 1987) were depleted. It’s fresh lively and uncluttered glowing with bright fruit (mandarin orange nectarine) lemon meringue pie and a creamy vanilla sweetness that coats the palate. A gently dry oak finish with subtle anise and very dark chocolate. A perky Glenrothes and a lot of fun to drink."
4298,6,"Inchgower makes its debut in the Special Releases range with this veteran bottling that was matured in in refill American oak. The nose offers a whiff of soy sauce honey and blotting paper. Salty and spicy on the palate with green apple walnut and cloves. Jaffa orange and black pepper in the long finish. (8544 bottles)"
4299,6,"Aged in American and Spanish oak. Figs cinnamon and pineapple up front on the nose; in time smoky fudge. The palate is rich and creamy with more fudge honey and tangerines. The orange note becomes more bitter accompanied by lively spices and subtle woodsmoke. Long in the finish with peppery oak."
4300,6,"Bruichladdich describes this as a “multi-vintage cuvee” and only Scottish-grown barley is used in its distillation. Ozone lemon juice fresh-planed wood and a hint of honey appear on the nose. The palate features toffee apples cinnamon ginger salt and oily oak. Pepper sea salt and relatively dry oak in the finish are balanced by toffee sweetness."
4301,6,"Chapter II of Arran’s The Devil’s Punch Bowl embraces whisky from a total of 27 casks. These are seventeen oloroso sherry hogsheads (from 1997 and ’98) six standard bourbon barrels (2002) and four peated bourbon casks (2004). Juicy dark berries malt and soft cinnamon on the nose. Robust and fruity on the palate with more dark berries plain chocolate a suggestion of vanilla and black pepper. Long and drying in the earthy mildly smoky finish with aniseed and licorice."
4302,6,"This limited-edition Bunnahabhain was aged in sherry casks until 2011 when it was transferred into first-fill Pedro Ximénez sherry butts. The nose offers leathery sherry red berries ozone and a little black pepper. Rich sweet fruit notes on the palate; overt sherry plus toffee dark chocolate and a hint of background salt. Cinnamon honey and raisins in the long finish. (2154 bottles for U.S.)"
4366,6,"Matured in first-fill sherry bourbon and French wine casks. Clean and fresh on the early nose; crisp green apples vanilla and floral notes with just a hint of maritime influence in the background. Smooth on the palate with spicy pear honey and ripe peaches; soon quite drying. The floral finish lingers with spicy honey drying spices and ultimately a hint of smoke. (18000 bottles)"
4303,6,"Described as the smokiest whisky produced at Talisker Dark Storm is exclusive to Travel Retail outlets and maturation has taken place in deeply charred casks. Rich fruity spices on the nose quite citric with brine and aromatic smoke. The smoke elbows its way to the fore in time. Full sweet fruity flavors on the palate some vanilla then smoke licorice and spice hit home. A classic Talisker smoke and chili finish but cranked up a notch or two! £45/1 liter"
4304,6,"The second Kilchoman to be fully matured in port casks this expression is a vatting of 30 ruby port casks filled in 2014. The nose offers milk chocolate sprinkled with white pepper sweet red wine and ultimately smoky citrus fruit. Big red berry notes lead on the palate followed by ginger and spicy peat. Tangy red currants and bonfire smoke in the relatively long finish. Impressive for its age. (10000 bottles)"
4305,6,"This includes whisky distilled from barley grown on three Islay farms. It was mainly matured in first-fill American oak along with Syrah and merlot wine casks. Fragrant peat warm tar ginger vanilla and sea salt on the nose. Peaches dipped in salt on the palate with milk chocolate and more vanilla then dark berries. The peat is spicy and quite acrid in the long briny finish."
4306,6,"This was initially matured in American white oak barrels before spending an unspecified finishing period in port pipes. The nose is soft and fragrant with vanilla red berries toffee and ultimately damsons. Viscous on the palate with blackcurrants plums port wine and cinnamon. Lively spices coffee grounds Seville orange and dry oak in the finish."
4307,6,"More obviously sherried on the nose than either Sigurd or Ragnvald; buttery with figs sultanas vanilla a hint of leather and ripe oranges. Rich and silky on the complex palate; overt sherry ginger and lots of old leather and sweet smoke. Spice is quite muted here. The finish is lengthy with plain chocolate wood smoke figs and tingling spices. Luxurious and accomplished. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €1000"
4308,6,"This Ardbeg Day 2019 bottling was aged in bourbon barrels before a period of finishing in rum casks. Characteristic Ardbeg citrus and smoke on the nose but with the addition of green figs eucalyptus antiseptic and brine. Very smooth on the palate with woodsmoke mango and papaya. Big peat and black pepper notes in the finish underscored by tangy citrus. Ultimately ashy smoke."
4309,9,"A new addition to the permanent Balvenie range. Lovely bright gold color. Layers of sweetness (the characteristic Balvenie honey along with vanilla fudge nougat and rich toffee) peppered with dried spice and a hint of tropical fruit (papaya guava tangerine). Nice viscosity with good grip on the finish. I really like the balance and complexity of this whisky. A very solid effort and the price is right."
4310,9,"Bright gold color. Soft aromas and flavors of delicate honey heather subtle spice tropical fruit creamy vanilla and malt. Nicely balanced throughout the palate and very clean-this whisky was aged in an excellent cask. There are no off flavor notes from the wood at all nor is it too woody on the finish. Rather it finishes soft gentle and clean."
4311,9,"Clean and fragrant on the nose with aromas of dried heather germinating barley and white chocolate. Soft sweet malt along with honeycomb crème brulee and a hint of fruit puree. The palate is soothingly malty delivering what the aroma promised (first the sweet notes then dried heather and spice) with a dry polished oak finish. The extra aging adds depth and the cask was obviously a good one with no hint of being tired or old."
4312,6,"The third and final expression in Arran’s Devil’s Punchbowl trilogy of limited releases is a multi-age bottling matured in eight oloroso sherry butts eight French oak barriques and five bourbon barrels. Only 6660 bottles are available. Figs dates citrus fruits and honey on the nose with developing savory notes. Silky sherry lively cinnamon and red berries on the palate with a hint of wood smoke. Lengthy in the finish with spicy oak."
4313,9,"Yellow gold color. Fresh floral aromas (reminiscent of a spring garden) creamy vanilla honey heather subtle fruit and a hint of toasted oak. Elegant and nicely balanced. Medium in body but richly so. Richly flavored too and nicely balanced with notes that echo the aromas. In fact this is one of the most balanced whiskies I've had in quite a while. A hint of salt spice and seaweed on the finish linger on indefinitely. This whisky is a pure joy to drink and demonstrates why Highland Park is so highly regarded. The fact that it was aged in a bourbon cask allows this whisky's more subtle notes to be fully appreciated. Quite delicious!"
4314,6,"Twelve of the world’s leading bartenders collaborated to create this limited release. Whiskies chosen spanned five decades and were aged in various oak barrels including American and German as well as rum red wine and Laphroaig casks. The nose is rich and fruity with Jaffa oranges apricots caramel and soft ginger. Voluptuous on the palate with nectarines Brazil nuts nutmeg and honey. Warming spices in the lengthy finish with lingering nectarine notes."
4315,6,"The first expression in Douglas Laing’s new Old Particular Consortium of Cards Single Cask Scotch Whisky Collection was sourced from a single refill butt. The nose offers sweet peat toffee bonbons brine beach tide lines and antiseptic. Finally a sooty chimney. The palate is zesty with ashy peat asphalt chili and citrus fruit. Dark chocolate more soot and extra chili in the very long finish. Quintessential Laphroaig! (665 bottles) £140"
4316,9,"Part of the “Rarest of the Rare” collection. Mosstowie was a limited production using Lomond stills for a brief time at the Miltonduff distillery. Very pale in color for a 30 year old whisky and creamy on the palate. A very clean whisky. Bright fruit (apricot lemon sultana) and vanilla are the main flavors with more subtle grass and hay notes. Soothing finish."
4317,9,"This whisky fits the profile of other extra-matured Glenlivet whiskies I’ve tasted. Notes of coconut and other assorted tropical fruit old rum caramel custard shortbread cookies vanilla malt and a hint of cotton candy. This is all balanced by polished oak. A soothing rather sweet whisky (which is quite surprising for its age)."
4318,1,"Immediately identifiable as Mortlach with a pleasant feral mélange of meat mingled with milk chocolate and gorse. There is elegant sweetness here but expressed as a mix of the bittersweet caramelized juices stuck to the bottom of a roasting pan with honey. The palate unsurprisingly is big and medium dry but here as well there’s some sweetness in the form of black fruits. Mortlach but in a slightly subtler guise than usual. £60"
4319,6,"The initial Glenrothes 1995 was released in 2011. This edition comprises first-fill American oak casks seasoned with dry oloroso sherry. Significant sherry cask influence early on the nose with a savory note rich fruitcake cherries malt and developing vanilla custard. Supple in the mouth with honey berry fruits and citrus notes. Spicier in time. The finish dries slightly with cinnamon and a sprinkling of black pepper."
4320,9,"Identifiably richer fuller and smokier on the nose when compared to other young Ardbegs. While still prominent there’s slightly less brine and seaweed more earthiness tar soot espresso tobacco grass and chocolate fudge. The same goes for the palate. It starts out like a “slightly more gutsy than normal” cask strength young Ardbeg (e.g. Renaissance) and if you go into this experience expecting to be totally blown away by peat tar and smoke you might feel a bit under-challenged initially. But the peat eventually builds to a powerful lava-like crescendo and you realize that this is no ordinary Ardbeg. The length of the finish is seemingly endless; bold and warming. Through all this there’s a soft underbelly of ripe barley and a vanilla sweetness to balance at least some of the tar heat and smoke -- something I admire in many Ardbegs. Bottom line: It’s an interesting entertaining and eye-opening experience. I like how mature it tastes for a relatively young whisky. But like a whisky that shows just a bit too much sherry or oak I think the extra peat to a degree masks the subtle complexities I admire in some other lesser-peated Ardbegs which is the only thing keeping me from scoring this whisky in the 90s. All smoky whisky enthusiasts should endeavor to try this at least once."
4321,9,"An elder Port Ellen but still showing plenty of Port Ellen character. It’s chock full of kiln smoke damp forest seaweed charcoal brine and tar. Additional notes of licorice root kalamata olive cinnamon and black pepper with teasing citrus emerging occasionally. Warming tarry dry smoke finish. An old-fashioned pungent Islay whisky."
4322,6,"A non-chill filtered single cask bottling from The Creative Whisky Co. This is a classic ‘full-on’ yet well-balanced Islay with a nose of sweet peat lemongrass iodine and brine. Ultimately a whiff of aromatic pipe tobacco. Sweet fruit notes on the palate developing smoky peat and barbecued meat. Long in the finish with spicy licorice chili and peat embers."
4323,9,"Aged in a combination of sherry and bourbon oak. Bold and fresh bursting with testosterone. Notes of damp kiln smoke tar wet sheep roasted chestnuts and pine forest bedding along with more subtle pear espresso anise and brine. Sweet notes of vanilla fig cake and maple syrup serve up balance and complexity. Appetizing brine and tar finish. It’s more mature than last year’s PC6. Earthier and less fruity too! Plus I feel that the sherry notes in PC7 integrate better than the Madeira notes from PC6. But my favorite is still the original PC5 for its purity balance maturity (for its age) and pristine character. (I lined up all three yesterday and tasted them side-by-side.)"
4324,6,"The 2000 vintage of Balblair is intended to replace the well-regarded 1997 variant. Matured in first-fill American oak this very drinkable expression represents good value for the money. A pretty peach and pineapple nose with coconut and honeyed vanilla. Toasted marshmallows with time. Relatively light-bodied sweet with lively spice ginger and youthful oak on the relatively complex palate. Fudge in the finish and a contrasting hint of dark chocolate at the last."
4325,6,"As with previous releases the 7th Edition of 100% Islay is produced from barley grown and malted at the distillery. Matured in fresh and refill Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels filled in 2010. Smoky ripe pears wood preservative vanilla and apple purée on the nose. Fresh citrus fruit buttery toffee and ashy peat on the palate. The lengthy finish features licorice and cigarette ash."
4326,6,"This bottling of Tullibardine was distilled in November 1989 and has been matured in a refill sherry butt. The U.S. allocation is 120 bottles. Initially damp earth on the nose sweetening to milk chocolate-covered fudge and vanilla along with hazelnuts. Notes of plum and black pepper with time. The palate is fruity with toffee spice and cedar wood notes. Long in the finish with cereal and spicy resin."
4327,9,"White wine color. Seaweed briny aromas and flavors. The classic Laphroaig medicinal pungent smoky rush kicks in on the finish and stays in overdrive for a very long time."
4328,6,"This 2017 edition is non-chill filtered and finished in Amarone dry Italian red wine casks. Slightly perfumed on the nose with a suggestion of madeira plus malt and ripe pears. Viscous in the mouth; earthy with plum and dry blackcurrant black coffee and plain chocolate balanced by notes of honey. Mouth-drying in the finish with a touch of tannic oak."
4329,1,"Let it be known that from now on June 2nd will be Ardbeg Day. That’s fine by me as annually we can enjoy delights such as this bold expression that belts you in the nose with coal tar and soot before bay rum emerges lightening slightly into lime and hot green bracken. The palate is oily sweet and very deep. A growly bugger that lurches toward the shore and then spins back to the laurel bushes inland. 13000 bottles."
4330,6,"Having previously released bottlings that were fully matured in sauternes casks Kilchoman has now launched one where initial maturation took place in bourbon barrels followed by 5 months of finishing in sauternes hogsheads. Unpeeled Jaffa oranges on the initial nose floral with a whiff of iodine and earthy peat. Tangerines milk chocolate lively spices and bitumen combine on the palate. The finish is long smoky and perpetually spicy."
4331,9,"The follow-up and older sibling to ""Curiositas."" I’ve been pushing for Speyside distilleries to bump up the peating levels of their malt they use for a long time because a majority of the spirits are big enough to handle the peat smoke and this whisky proves my point. The tarry peat smoke and bacon-like notes are a delight and they are balanced nicely by a honey and apple pie sweetness. Spanish olives in brine dark chocolate golden raisin and subtle spice round out the palate nicely. Not a heavy whisky but pretty powerful stuff for BenRiach. So nice of the previous owners of this distillery to experiment with higher peating levels decades ago."
4332,6,"Distilled in 2012 entirely from Scottish barley this was aged for 5 years in American whiskey barrels. The nose is sweet with apricots vanilla ginger white pepper ozone and antiseptic cream plus insistent smoky peat. Orchard fruits on the palate with big earthy smoke notes vanilla and coconut. The finish is long with licorice black pepper rock salt and drying peat."
4333,7,"From a Speyside distillery whose malt is more commonly found in blends. An enticing and complex nose balances sweet honey acidic dried orange rich walnut and light smoke. On the palate these elements come together well with complexity and balance. Things get spicy in the mid-palate with black pepper salt ginger and a bump in smoke. A long finish rounds everything off showcasing smoke and orange. Lots of character and flavor for an uncommon malt. (U.S. only)"
4334,6,"Distilled from Scottish barley in 2010 this was matured in first-fill bourbon casks and second-fill French wine casks before finishing in Bordeaux French oak. Fruity peat salty vanilla heather toffee and malt on the nose. Peaches and pineapple wrapped in peat with marshmallows and rock salt on the supple palate. A whiff of iodine in the finish with berries cloves licorice and spicy oak."
4335,6,"Diageo has introduced this new no age statement variant of Talisker single malt. The name reflects the distiller’s aspiration to enhance the maritime notes in this expression. Refill and rejuvenated casks have both contributed to its maturation. The nose is youthful but rounded with brine burning wood embers vanilla and honey. Sweet and spicy on the palate with cranberries and black currants while peat smoke is always present plus black pepper. The finish lingers with walnuts and fruity peat. £40"
4336,6,"Following a decade in bourbon barrels Lasanta is finished for 2 years in oloroso and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. Caramel milk chocolate and hazelnuts merge on the nose with the spicy dried fruit and orange notes associated with sherry wood maturation. Spicy sultanas and damsons on the full sweet palate with more caramel milk chocolate nutmeg and oak. The finish is long and smooth with dark chocolate and wood spices."
4337,9,"A lovely example of what not chill-filtering can do for a whisky. Meticulous cask selection also helps play a part here. Very straightforward on the surface (no surprises) but with vibrant well-defined flavors and a comforting creamy texture on the palate. Bright fruit defines this whisky (lime kiwi ripe melon sultana fresh peach) accompanied by honeyed malt heather and a hint of spice and smoke. A fun whisky suitable for many moods and occasions. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
4338,6,"Malt and mango on the nose with just a hint of meatiness and earth. Pear and resin notes appear in time. Orchard fruits vanilla cloves and cocoa powder on the palate. The sweet fruit notes are quite intense. Hazelnut and fudge in the medium-length finish. (£48)"
4339,9,"Matured in a bourbon hogshead. Floral nose. Soft creamy and elegant with honeyed malt custard subtle butterscotch and delicate fruit (orange peach) peppered with spice (powdered vanilla nutmeg). Well-balanced gently dry and easy drinking. A charming whisky (for a lazy Sunday afternoon perhaps?)"
4340,6,"A belated addition to Diageo’s Special Releases range for 2011 this offering is from the now-demolished distillery in Stonehaven which closed in 1985. Just 1500 bottles are available and maturation has taken place in American oak refill casks filled in 1970. Resin malt nutmeg and wood polish on the nose with developing vanilla and brittle toffee. Full in the mouth slightly oily and notably fruity with heather and cinnamon notes. Pepper and bitter orange in the long finish. £525"
4341,6,"This veteran Balblair was distilled on February 7 1969 using barley malted on site and coal-fired stills. Just 999 bottles have been released. Opens with slight saltiness on the nose almost ozone then lemons and pine and finally vanilla fudge. Overt citrus notes on the palate with aniseed some oak brittle toffee and a smokiness not found in younger Balblairs. The finish is long and discreetly spicy notably cinnamon and black pepper."
4342,6,"This non-chill filtered vintage release was matured in a mix of American oak and Spanish oak sherry casks and stored in traditional dunnage warehouses. Peaches and vanilla on the nose with a hint of milk chocolate-coated Turkish Delight and background ginger. Tinned peaches in cream and more ginger on the palate then orange notes emerge. Spicy in the long finish with plain chocolate."
4343,6,"BenRiach’s latest release was matured in a combination of four diverse cask types: bourbon virgin oak Pedro Ximénez sherry and red wine. The nose offers tangerines milk chocolate and spicy vanilla. Peaches Brazil nuts raisins dates and more chocolate on the palate with red berries in the background. The finish is medium in length with cocoa powder and ginger. £125; Not available in the U.S."
4344,6,"This is non-chill filtered and carries no age statement. The nose is earthy with damp herbaceous borders quite acrid smoke and spicy cranberries. Fresh juicy red berries on the palate with background peat smoke becoming ashy with rich red wine notes. The red wine persists in the finish accompanied by prickly black pepper. £70; Not available in the U.S."
4345,6,"After initial maturation in bourbon casks this expression underwent a 2-month finish in first-fill oloroso sherry casks. Initially it offers char then ginger honey and sweet smoke on the nose with apricot tarts and toffee. The palate is quite earthy and peppery with stone fruit cinnamon sea salt and light smokiness. Medium length in the finish with citrus fruit and salty oak."
4346,6,"Primary maturation took place in an ex-bourbon cask then from 2006 in a cask sourced from the vineyard of Chateau Haut Marbuzet previously used to hold Cabernet Sauvignon. A final three years were spent in a newly-emptied bourbon barrel. Gingerbread summer berries and fig rolls on the nose. Fudge and vanilla. Black cherries raisins lots of lively spice and a red wine ‘edge’ in the mouth. Freshly-baked ginger cake in the long spicy finish. Cask number 10; 223 bottles."
4347,10,"Thanks to the Gulf Stream palm trees grow on Arran’s west coast. That prevailing sunny climate appears to have influenced this mature example from Lochranza: ripe yellow summer fruits lime zest strong mixed spices and notes of the sea like sand brushed from seashells. Very approachable; this just oozes sunshine bringing us the joys of sweet citrus spices marzipan mango and papaya. The finish is like slurping melted ice cream."
4348,9,"Longmorn is now being bottled one year older. Whisky companies seem to be discontinuing odd-year whiskies. Bowmore recently extended their 17 year old to 18. Ironically in both instances the older whiskies serve up more sherry and fruit. Both the Longmorn 15 and Bowmore 17 were considered benchmark whiskies so these changes weren’t without risk. Still in both instances the new expressions won’t disappoint. This new Longmorn shows a mouth-coating maltiness -- Longmorn’s signature characteristic. Along with this there’s ripe barley honeyed fruit (peach with subtle sultana and pineapple) gently complex nuts (almonds brazil nuts) and a hint of chocolate-covered coconut. A lush fruity-sweet dram that lingers long on the palate. True Longmorn devotees will still want to purchase a bottle of the 15 year old while they can."
4349,6,"After initial maturation in American white oak this 1991 expression was filled into a 15 year old Lepanto brandy cask from Gonzales Byass in May 2003 ultimately being re-racked into a fresh ‘distillery run’ bourbon barrel in August 2009. Caramel and white chocolate on the nose malt fudge cinnamon and nutmeg then burnt treacle and hot brandy. Malt sweet spice almonds bananas and fudge on the palate. Spicy fruits in the lengthy Armagnac-like finish. Cask number 1; 233 bottles."
4350,9,"Subtle elegance creamy and extremely drinkable. Mouthwatering fruity notes (lemon lime tangerine passion fruit) marry well with notes of fresh-cut grass vanilla and honey. Very clean too and nicely balanced! When I drink a Lowland whisky this good I am saddened by all of the Lowland distilleries that have gone silent over the past 25 years knowing what we have lost."
4504,9,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Amber gold Aroma: Full and creamy. Floral honey fruit gum drops. Palate: Rich and mouth-coating. Clean. Nicely balanced. Notes of vanilla honey and assorted fruits up front followed by spicy oak notes with a dried fruit finish."
4351,1,"Although from a refill the mahogany color suggests a short previous use. Some nose burn with a mature edge of leather and dark chocolate. Here’s Glenfarclas in a darker guise with raisin and a savory aspect; think roast pheasant and walnuts lamb and mint sauce. The palate is big thick and sweet with lots of extract but also Turkish delight sultana and prune. While sherried it’s not in any way overcooked; the tannins are balanced the sweetness massive. £625"
4352,1,"A touch of damp dunnage some Ardbeggian soot and plenty of jalapeño-style heat. Shows maturity and depth of character with just-dead bonfire ointment and a sweetness which here is like honeycomb. Water makes it bolder with deeper smoke while the palate has sweet wood balanced (cigar-accented) smoke and layers of salt angelica and plum. £90/500 ml"
4353,1,"Bold with smoked fish (Arbroath smokies) dried fruits. Has requisite density of character with classic notes of freshly-laid tarmac and medicine. A lemon edge adds some lift. The complexity continues on the tongue which is very juicy; vanilla-accented but with plenty of seaweed-like smoke that shifts into licorice. Long balanced and thick in the center with some (smoked) dried thyme on the finish. £70/500 ml"
4354,6,"Tomatin released this 28 year old expression under its Cù Bòcan label. This cask strength variant was matured in refill hogsheads and refill sherry butts that previously contained heavily-peated Islay single malt. The nose is sweet and fruity with apples and pears background vanilla and sweet light smoke. The palate is voluptuous and sherry-sweet with chili peppers and subtle earthy peat smoke. The finish is slowly drying with persistent spice nuts and smoke. (2200 bottles) £200"
4355,6,"This limited edition bottling is non-chill filtered and initially matured in bourbon barrels before an unspecified period of finishing in sweet Moscatel fortified wine casks from Spain and Portugal. Sweet grapes dates cinnamon salted butter wax polish and printer’s ink on the nose. Viscous on the palate with ripe plums honey plain chocolate white pepper and worn leather. The finish is long and fruity with drying oak."
4356,6,"The oldest expression available from Speyburn this has been aged in a mix of American oak fino sherry and bourbon casks and is non-chill filtered. Vanilla honey lemon and spice on the fragrant nose. Quite full-bodied and creamy on the palate; nutty with malt honey and citrus fruit. The citrus fruit becomes spicier in the medium-length oaky finish."
4357,9,"Amber-gold color. Exotic tropical fruit aromas (citrus melon coconut) with interwoven notes of almonds pear honey and subtle peat smoke. Light to medium in body and very delicate in nature. On the palate the whisky begins sweet (especially honey) followed by a basket of exotic fruit and nuts similar to its aroma becoming drier and distantly smoky on the finish. This Bowmore Fino Cask a whisky which has aged very well indeed is the first of three limited edition 1964 vintage Bowmore whiskies to be released over the next year. The two to follow in 2003 have been aged in bourbon oak and oloros sherry casks."
4358,9,"Copper color with shades of ruby. Intriguing aromas of sweet plum grapes citrus peat smoke seaweed and brine. Full-bodied and somewhat viscous. Flavors of ripe fruit (plums grapes citrus) followed by a burst of more traditional Bowmore flavors (peat smoke brine seaweed) finishing with lingering notes of prunes dates baker’s chocolate and licorice.

While there is no age statement this whisky was aged for 12 years in bourbon barrels followed by an additional 18 months in ruby port casks. I believe it is the first distillery bottling to marry port with the traditional flavors of an Islay whisky. Because of this it is best to keep an open mind when trying this whisky perhaps even having more than one go at it before rendering a verdict. I suspect the more you try Voyage the more you will like."
4359,9,"Deep gold color. Fragrant floral aroma with a potpourri of dried spices especially vanilla and nutmeg. Creamy texture. Flavors of creamy vanilla and caramel becoming dry with subtle spices and just a hint of fruit."
4360,9,"Amber with orange and ruby hues. Aromas of Islay peat smoke wine fruit and background floral and spice notes. Flavors reveal more of what the aroma suggests-peat smoke fruit and floral/spice notes-with a balancing oak and subtle sea salt and seaweed. The peat smoke particularly comes in on the finish lest one forgets where Bowmore hails from. There is no age statement on the label but this whisky has been aged for 12 years in traditional bourbon and sherry barrels and then finished off for 18 months in Bordeaux (Claret) wine casks. The wine fruit certainly is evident and like the Glenmorangie Claret Wood Finish offered a year or so ago will appeal to those with an open mind and willingness to accept new flavors in whisky. Purists will say it detracts from the distillery's character. I believe it's the first smoky whisky that attempts to marry these flavors with claret fruitiness. 480 bottles for U.S. 12000 bottles for Travel Retail."
4361,9,"Even drier and expressing more of the complex floral and spice notes found in the 15 year old. However by the time the whisky reaches mid-palate the dried fruits dried spices and general wood notes become prominent preventing the whisky from revealing other sides of its usually multi-faceted personality. It’s still a very fine whisky but not as good as the 15 regardless of price."
4362,9,"Amber color. Aromas of peat smoke (but more subdued than many Bowmore whiskies in their teens) toasted oak citrus fruit vanilla and a hint of the sea. Its flavors are similar which express themselves in a very mature manner-oak flavors are more dominant than other components. Still there is an emerging brine freshness that keeps the whisky from becoming tired and dull. Good lengthy finish. 
Style: Islay single malt Scotch whisky. Availability: only 244 bottles total."
4363,9,"Antique gold color. Aromas of peat smoke damp earth exotic pepper vanilla and fruit. Medium body. A great balance of flavors with a lovely Islay character. The whisky begins sweet up front ultimately turning pleasingly dry towards the finish. In between you'll enjoy flavors of peat smoke vanilla spicy pepper and delicately honeyed malt with just a hint of the sea. What I like most about this whisky is its impeccable balance-between youth and maturity sweetness and dryness-with just the right amount of peat smoke to declare its Islay roots without smothering its other flavors."
4364,1,"Caol Ila in unpeated guise. There’s no age statement but what you get is a mix of the fresh and the mature: a vibrant attack with fresh Victoria plum grapes and a hint of oiliness. Give it time and the sensation is like afternoon tea at your auntie’s with thickly-buttered scones dripping with honey or pineapple jam. The palate is equally sweet and gentle and only needs a little drop of water to reveal light spice. A wee beauty."
4365,1,"Glenrothes is always this fascinating mix of the malty and the fruity and is one of those drams which needs time in the glass to open. Given that time you will be rewarded with date raisin some fudge and some real savory depth before a sprinkling of trail mix and a sweetening into nougat and caramel spice and chocolate. A replacement for the old Select Reserve this is a magnificent Glenrothes and at a great price so don’t dare moan."
4367,6,"The Millennium Casks is a non-chill filtered vatting of 45 Arran casks filled on December 31 1999 and January 1 2000; 35 bourbon barrels and 10 sherry hogsheads. A spicy floral nose with sherry honey coconut ice orange fudge and ultimately raisin notes. Smooth and luscious on the palate with apple pie and custard plus a sprinkling of cinnamon. Long and spicy in the finish with oranges a hint of black pepper licorice and drying oak. (7800 bottles). £65"
4368,6,"The Massandra winery which supplies casks for Glenglassaugh’s Massandra Connection bottlings is the oldest in Crimea and reputedly produced Tsar Alexander III’s favorite wines. The 1973 distillation which has been finished in sherry casks has a nose of sultanas cinnamon sweet grass and herbal notes in the background. Bung cloth char and finally damp undergrowth. Complex aromatic progression. Mouth-coating with sweet spicy tropical fruit notes and oloroso. Slowly drying with bitter orange and mild tannins at the close. £645"
4369,1,"A very solid and sound Bowmore with saline notes some dried hot pepper and masses of menthol which give a buzzy nose-cleaning effect. The smoke gently glides along throughout. The palate is quite thick and shows sweetness and a slow release of soft fruit with a tingle of salt. The smoke slowly increases until it concentrates on the back palate giving an effect like burning pine logs on the beach. Becomes nicely funky in time. Recommended."
4370,6,"The 2016 Fèis Ìle limited edition of Jura was triple finished in sherry casks namely palomino fino amoroso oloroso and apostoles oloroso and is non-chill filtered. The nose is soft and warming with notes of candy vanilla and almonds against a sweet sherry background. The palate is rich and rounded with a significant sherry influence—dried fruits notably raisins and prunes new leather and aniseed. Finally slightly mouth-drying with prickly spices and more raisins. (2016 Jura Tastival whisky festival exclusive) £85"
4371,6,"The oldest of Bablair’s current core bottlings was distilled in 1990 and after maturing for 21 years in bourbon casks it was transferred to oloroso sherry butts for a further 2 years prior to bottling. Citrus fruits furniture polish cloves cinnamon and parma violets on the nose. A silky mouthfeel spicy with dark berries dates and rich sherry. Slowly drying with aniseed and dark chocolate in the finish."
4372,6,"The first Diageo Special Releases Oban to be released since 2004 has been matured in rejuvenated American oak and second-fill bodega casks. The outturn is 2860 bottles. Tinned peaches ginger caramel and newly-sawn wood on the nose with an accompanying marine note. Syrupy in the mouth very sweet and spicy with nutmeg cinnamon and baked apple. Contrast is provided by a splash of brine. Spicy in the drying finish with ginger to the fore plus more sea salt."
4373,6,"This is the first single malt to be released by the Last Drop Distillers and the Aberdeen-shire veteran is old-style well-peated Glen Garioch. Unusually it was matured in what the bottlers describe as “a bourbon-style remade hogshead cask.” Just 118 bottles are available globally. Fruity and herbal on the nose with apples marzipan ginger linseed and a hint of camphor. Complex and distinctive. Surprisingly vibrant fruit notes fill the perfumed palate with allspice before it starts to become tannic. Ultimately very mouth-drying with subtle smoke and a fatty spice note at the very end."
4374,6,"This limited edition release of Glen Garioch is the first from the Aberdeenshire distillery to have been matured entirely in oloroso sherry casks. Just 1000 cases of the 14 year old expression are available globally. Old leather slightly earthy sultanas white pepper and a hint of lemon pith on the nose. The palate is big and bold with more pepper plus cinnamon caramel orange and abundant sherry. Enduring spice licorice and slightly smoky raisins in the finish."
4375,9,"Toffee and nougat with a lacing of cotton candy. It then turns richly nutty-almost chewy-with notes of dried apricot sultana and a touch of red currant. Firm dry oak resin finish. A well-structured whisky indicative of the Mortlach pedigree."
4376,1,"Poor old Auchroisk. Not only couldn’t anyone pronounce it correctly (it’s “Oth Rusk” in case you’re interested) but in recent years it’s seen its Singleton prefix hijacked by other larger distilleries — Glendullan Dufftown Glen Ord — leaving it somewhat forgotten by malt mavens. Part of the old J&B stable it continues to make a malty/nutty spirit a style which is also somewhat out of favor in the world of single malts. 
Maybe this bottling (in a rather spiffing retro pack) will redress the balance. The color is full gold and though initially the nose shows the high bottling strength to the max beneath the prickly heat is eucalyptus oil alongside those signature nutty/cereal notes. But here’s the difference; there’s sweetness too: toffee and thick clover honey even a touch of sawdust and pencil shavings before a drop of water brings out malted milk and powdered hazelnut. In other words there’s plenty of distillery character but good cask development. 
In the mouth when neat the needling alcohol slightly numbs the tongue and the effect from start to finish is a bit fragmented. Add water however (not too much) and there’s a soft creamy effect across the tongue with praline almond and a dark chocolate note as well. Be careful with the water though as you need to retain the zesty acidity on the finish."
4377,1,"If Cragganmore is sometimes overlooked then what of this poor Lowlander whose qualities are consistently overlooked? Again here we have a pale color suggesting use of refill casks but whereas Cragganmore was reticent to the point of being mute this is expressive and lively. The nose with intense floral notes of lilac blossom freesia and chamomile is a revelation. These are backed with a thick unsalted butter note that suggests that the cask might not have been as quiet as first imagined. Give it time and out come boiled sweets and a fresh green note like a just-whittled stick. A hint of wheat chaff and fragrant grasses brings to mind lying in a summer meadow watching the dust motes dance in the sunshine. The mouth is sweet and lemon-accented with a pickup of a pleasant chalkiness on the nose that gives it the suggestion of a fino sherry or Vin Jaune. I like its energy and feel that the addition of water reduces its vibrancy so for drinking purposes I’d have a glass of ice cold water on the side. All in all impressive with just a hint of soap on the finish taking it below the 90 mark."
4378,6,"Cask # 328 was filled at Glenturret on December 16 1986 by stillmen Hugh Malloy and Chic Brock. After 28 years of maturation it has yielded 240 bottles. It is exclusively available online at thefamousgrouse.com. Boiled fruit sweets heather hazelnuts old oak and musty bung-cloths on the nose plus slight mint. The palate is rich and fruity with honey rum vanilla fudge and ginger root. Spicy milk chocolate and coconut in the lengthy finish with non-intrusive oak. Classic Glenturret. £200"
4379,9,"An excellent example of a younger Bruichladdich and an interesting contrast to the Duncan Taylor expression reviewed above. Appetizing and very clean with a creamy texture. Honey and vanilla notes accentuate a fresh maltiness with underlying marshmallow grass and hay. The whisky finishes nicely rounded pleasingly dry and salty with a hint of seaweed. A great aperitif."
4380,6,"This veteran Ledaig release from Tobermory distillery is the oldest to date having been made in 1972. 500 bottles are available globally. Musty old leather malt and plum pudding on the slightly earthy phenolic nose. In time the leather becomes suppler with ripe figs and finally soot. Voluptuous in the mouth with sweet sherry plain chocolate and soft spices plus black pepper an emerging note of coal. The finish is very long with citrus fruit chili smoke and subtle oakiness."
4381,9,"The first Tempest to be imported to the U.S. Aged exclusively in first-fill bourbon casks. With the bourbon cask and relatively young age you can really feel all the Islay love. Bracing with plenty of sea character along with honeyed vanilla citrus floral notes (especially lavender) rumbling peat smoke tobacco and resinous oak on the finish.  A bit steep in price for a 10 year old but very dynamic."
4382,6,"This unpeated single malt updates and replaces the previous 10 year old. It presents tropical fruits vanilla honey and ginger on the nose. Soft fruits malt and milk chocolate inhabit the creamy well-balanced palate. Hazelnuts drinking chocolate and light spices surface in the medium-length finish with just a wisp of smoke."
4383,9,"Bottled in 2004 and still in circulation. A very traditional Caol Ila. Not a heavy-bodied whisky but it throws a strong punch. Notes of tarry rope infused with seaweed and brine all on an oily malty vanilla foundation. Throw in some orchard fruit Manzanilla olive black licorice stick and soot with brine and Tellicherry pepper on the finish. Clean fun and dynamic."
4384,1,"You’d hardy expect Kilchoman to be able to spare casks for independent bottlings but somehow TWE’s Sukhinder Singh has persuaded Anthony Wills to part with one of his precious babies. It exhibits classic Kilchoman notes of clove and fresh scallop backed with subtle peat chamomile and lint. With water a typically young peaty aroma of rubber develops (so drink it neat). It shows the huge potential of this distillery. £50 (500 ml)"
4385,6,"The nose is lightly floral with pears and ripe peaches followed by red apple with a light sprinkling of white pepper. The palate is creamy and very sweet with more orchard fruits and a little spice. The medium-length finish is slightly drying with some lightly spiced oak"
4386,1,"Bunnahabhain along with Bowmore is Islay’s greatest user of ex-sherry casks; a throwback to the days when it was part of Highland Distillers. Its rich thick and ginger-accented spirit matches the attention of European oak extremely well. In this red tea-colored example you have resin saddle soap ginseng and treacle toffee on the nose and a fusillade of roasted spices on the palate before the finish reveals sweet gingerbread. A big huggable bear. £60"
4387,6,"Kosher-certified and matured in a refill bourbon barrel before finishing in a barrel from Israel’s Flam Winery. Sweet red wine strawberries and cream and spicy apple pie on the nose. The palate is voluptuous with cocoa Brazil nuts and increasingly dry red wine. Dark-chocolate raspberry liqueur oak and black pepper in the long finish. (1600 bottles)"
4388,6,"Royal Glenury was established in 1825 and closed in 1985. Salted butter on the early nose Turkish delight then dry nutty sherry. Very nutty on the palate with figs and wine tannins. The lengthy finish reveals dates bitter coffee and black treacle. (397 bottles 38 for U.S.)"
4389,1,"The original Singleton seemingly discarded as a single malt rides back defiantly with this bottling. The start shows cherrystone but there’s an immediate deepening into mature notes of roasted chestnut varnish and sweet leather but always sufficient caramel sweetness to balance. The palate starts sweetly and any grip is dissolved with a drop of water which also extends what otherwise is a quick fade. Old yes oak yes but layered and good."
4390,6,"This is the first release of Singleton of Dufftown to be matured solely in refill American oak hogsheads. The nose is slightly earthy with developing barley sugar and green fruits. The supple palate offers honey sweet orange walnuts and soft spice. The finish is peppery with crystallized ginger and a hint of dark chocolate."
4391,6,"Both bourbon and sherry casks were used for aging. Stewed fruits butterscotch and soft spices on the nose. Silky palate delivery with honey dark chocolate light sherry and cloves. Lingering finish with citrus and allspice."
4392,6,"Released exclusively for the U.S. this is the first bottling in an annual series celebrating what Macallan terms its “…unrivalled commitment to the mastery of wood and spirit.” Matured in oloroso sherry-seasoned American and European oak casks. Confident Christmas cake aromas plus quite assertive oak. Honey toffee vanilla nutmeg ginger and lively oak on the palate. Gingery wood notes in the medium-length finish."
4393,6,"This 11 year old bottling of Longrow from Springbank distillery was matured for seven years in refill bourbon casks before being filled into cabernet sauvignon hogsheads for a final four years. 9000 bottles are available. The nose offers buttery smoked haddock coal tar soap citrus fruit and new leather with background notes of soft peat. Mouth coating with rich peat on the palate plus fruity spice and developing licorice notes. Long in the finish with persistent peat smoke and finally red currants. £50"
4394,10,"Lemon and lime zest stewed fruits drizzled in caramel granola butterscotch and refined oak tones on the nose. The meatiness in Cragganmore’s new make spirit has long since mellowed in the cask. Light orange vanilla honey and those nuggets of hard sherbet that spark up on the tongue. The second phase opens up toffee notes wood spice flapjacks and ends with nougat and orange peel. (Batch 2; 130 bottles)"
4395,6,"Port Cask is the third and final release in Bowmore’s Vintner’s Trilogy. It was matured for 13 years in bourbon barrels then 14 years in port pipes. Woodsmoke and blackcurrant on the mildly medicinal nose with developing sea salt and vanilla fudge. Smoky dried fruit on the palate with a hint of brine. Old oak antiseptic and black pepper in the finish."
4396,6,"Matured in bourbon barrels and oloroso sherry casks. Tangerines barley sugar milky coffee soft toffee and sweet sherry on the inviting nose. Orange carries over to the palate with spicy dark chocolate ginger and cocktail cherries. The finish features vanilla long-lasting dark chocolate and prunes."
4397,6,"Finished in sherry casks. The nose is slightly reticent with orange peel instant coffee and a hint of burning coal. More obvious orange notes on the palate with milk chocolate and drying oak. Dark chocolate and slightly bitter oak in the medium-length finish."
4398,6,"Three Wood has been a key part of Auchentoshan’s portfolio since 2002. It was matured in bourbon then finished in oloroso and Pedro Ximénez casks. Orange peel dried apricots milk chocolate and fresh-sawn oak on the nose. Toffee stewed fruits sherry cinnamon and wood spice on the palate. The finish is quite long with malt oak and dark chocolate."
4399,6,"This 2014 bottling of Ben Nevis illustrates how good the single malt can be with robust sherry cask maturation. Distilled in June 1998 it was filled into a fresh sherry butt and matured for 15 years before 582 bottles were released. Raisins prunes old polished leather and roasted meat on the nose. The body is full with the palate offering succulent dark berries dates raisins and plain chocolate. Long and spicy in the finish with cloves and rum raisin-flavored dark chocolate. £92"
4400,6,"This 9 year old Deanston spent almost 8 years in bourbon barrels before being transferred into French brandy butts for a final 2 years of aging. Cognac notes on the early nose rich and spicy with toffee nutmeg instant coffee and rhubarb crumble. The palate is sweet smooth and buttery with brandy honey and polished oak. The finish dries with licorice and chili warmth then finally tangy dark berries. (3432 bottles)"
4401,6,"Distilled in 2003 this expression spent a decade maturing in bourbon barrels before a further 5 years in first-fill Portuguese moscatel wine barriques. It was bottled without chill-filtration. The nose offers fragrant spices and red apples sprinkled lightly with white pepper. Very fruity on the supple palate with strawberries-and-cream notes background citrus almonds and slightly musty oak. Black pepper and figs in the medium-length finish."
4402,6,"Distilled in 2006 and aged 11 years in an oloroso hogshead (#101751). The nose offers butterscotch sultanas and developing caramel notes. Smooth and sweet on the palate with banana figs malt and a hint of sherry in the background. Medium to long in the finish with a suggestion of lemon and insistent fruity spices. (224 bottles)"
4403,6,"This kosher-certified single cask was matured in a refill bourbon barrel before finishing in a wine barrel from Israel’s Flam Winery. The nose opens with barbecue smoke and new leather then rosé wine salt and ginger cookies emerge. The nutty palate features woodsmoke cocoa instant coffee stewed fruits and more salt. The finish is long with coffee dry red wine and prickly oak. (400 bottles)"
4404,6,"This 2017 release spent 22 years in bourbon casks before a final 3 years in oloroso sherry Spanish oak butts. Bright fruits on the nose: orange lemon and lime with vanilla soft toffee and plain chocolate. Supple and silky on the palate with sweet orange notes more vanilla and cocoa powder. Cocoa nutmeg dry sherry and wood spices in the lengthy finish. (450 bottles)"
4405,6,"Made with barley malted to 139.6 ppm distilled in 2014 and matured 5 years in first-fill Jim Beam Jack Daniel and Heaven Hill casks. Citrus fruit and unripe bananas on the nose and in time clean pine notes. Vanilla salted caramel chewy orange and prickly woodsmoke on the palate. Lively prickly prominent peat a suggestion of honey and more citrus fruit in the lengthy finish. (30000 bottles)"
4406,9,"Very powerful and quite different from the 10 year old 46% bottling reviewed below; this tastes as if it is taken entirely from bourbon oak-aged Springbank. There’s fresh brine creamy vanilla honey and coconut throughout and it lacks the waxed fruit nature of its sibling. Mouthcoating in texture with a long appetizing briny finish. Very clean -- and quite polished too for such a powerful whisky. My choice of the three."
4407,6,"6660 bottles of The Devil’s Punch Bowl have been released and the component whiskies come from 24 casks filled between 1996 and 2006. They include a number of sherry butts and some peated spirit is included in the mix. The nose offers soft mellow malt dried fruits and milk chocolate. Silky smooth and deceptively drinkable at full strength the palate is nutty and notably fruity with ginger and brittle toffee. A hint of barbecue sauce in the sweet finish."
4408,9,"Like the Clynelish 14 year old also reviewed in this issue it is nice to see Diageo finally introduce official distillery bottlings of Caol Ila here in the U.S. (after being available in the UK for many years now). My suitcases were getting quite heaving on my return trips from Scotland. This is a splendid Coal Ila. It is wonderfully vibrant. Understandably the immediate impact on the palate is the peat smoke but there's so much else going on here too: smoked olives seaweed salt and pepper all placed on a gently sweet bed of toffee and vanilla fudge. Lingering smoke olives and seaweed on the finish."
4409,6,"The nose is perfumed with citrus fruit ginger wood spice and nutty toffee. Green apples more nuts coconut vanilla and cocoa powder on the palate. Milk chocolate and soft spices in the medium-length mildly herbal finish."
4410,9,"Amber gold color. An exciting aroma-classic Islay. It is very phenolic reminiscent of standing downwind of a peat kiln. Interwoven spice (especially pepper) seaweed and sweet & sour notes add complexity. Light to medium in body but quite oily. Nicely balanced flavors of peat smoke seaweed salt & pepper all wrapped up in a gentle sweetness. Lingering peat smoke and spice on the finish. Yet another example of Caol Ila's fine pedigree. This bottling has great balance and I especially enjoy how the smoke and sweetness marry together. My only criticism is that it is a bit soft for Caol Ila. I would love to try this whisky at 46 or 50% ABV which would give it a bit more guts."
4411,6,"Balblair 2001 Vintage is the first distillery bottling to be non-chill filtered noncolored and offered at 46%. It is 10 years old and has been matured in ex-bourbon barrels. The nose offers lemonade vanilla allspice and developing milk chocolate and caramel notes. Clean and straightforward on the palate; sweet and spicy with tangerines eating apples toffee and more milk chocolate. Cocoa powder in the spicy relatively lengthy finish. £33"
4412,9,"A rounded and mature affair. The 25 years in oak has made it a bit more refined (and drier on the palate) compared to younger expressions. All the classic Caol Ila notes are stillthere-mustard seaweed olives damp peat salt and pepper. A touch of vanilla wafer anise smoked almonds and tarry rope add complexity. Those of you who prefer Ardbeg 17 over the 10 and Laphroaig 15 over the 10 will be attracted to this whisky when compared to Caol Ila's younger siblings. But at $225 it's an expensive date isn't it?"
4413,6,"Previously offered as a 12 year old it now has an extra three years of secondary maturation after a decade in ex-bourbon casks. The ‘finishing’ casks are ex-Sauternes barriques. Lemonade icing sugar vanilla nougat and maple on the nose. Progressively sweeter. Rich and sweet on the palate notably fruity with spicy orange and brittle toffee. Medium length finish with milk chocolate-coated ginger and lingering toffee. £39"
4414,6,"This follows Valkyrie in the Viking Legend series. Distilled using a proportion of Tartan barley grown on Orkney which is said to produce additional smokiness. Matured mainly in sherry-seasoned American oak casks. Smoldering wood embers on the early nose with heather in bloom and apple blossom. Vanilla cloves and smoky citrus fruit on the palate. The finish yields peat aniseed and nutmeg."
4415,6,"This is the second travel retail-exclusive expression of Old Pulteney to use the registration of a Wick fishing vessel in its name in this case the Isabella Fortuna a herring drifter dating from 1890. This expression bears no age statement and was matured in bourbon casks. Floral and fragrant on the nose with honey vanilla zest of lemon and a hint of salt. The palate features fresh fruit salad coconut and sherbet liveliness. Summery. Medium length in the spicy finish. £35 (1 liter)"
4416,6,"This expression dates from 2002 when Balvenie first produced a batch of heavily peated malt. Matured in American oak casks the nose exhibits subtle peat balanced by honey vanilla and ripe red apples. On the palate the soft smoke is well integrated with vanilla more honey ginger and overripe pears. Ashy peat citrus fruits cinnamon and tangy oak in the finish. An elegant peated whisky."
4417,6,"Distilled in 1984 just a few months before the distillery closed this was aged in refill American oak hogsheads. A whiff of early earthiness gives way to pear drops honey vanilla and resin on the nose. Pears pineapple caramel and vanilla on the slightly waxy spicy palate. Slowly drying in the medium-length finish with peppery licorice and a hint of char. (3972 bottles)"
4418,9,"Caperdonich is always a challenge to find. This one is aged in a sherry cask. One would fear that slumbering away for 35 years in a sherry cask would completely dominate this whisky’s profile. Not this whisky. As you would expect it is nicely matured but it is surprisingly clean and well rounded too! Exotic notes of dried fruits sultana subtle (but viscous) honey sandalwood and a potpourri of spice (especially cinnamon anise ginger). Clean subtly spicy finish. Slowly sip and savor its delicate pleasures."
4419,9,"The first 10 year old release containing whisky produced entirely by the new owners. I love the interplay here between the malt sherry and smoke with all getting a chance to shine. A rich vanilla-tinged malty foundation deep caramel rhum agricole an array of lush fruit and dark chocolate along with grassy/hay notes honeysuckle subtle spice (cinnamon anise) and lingering earthy smoke. A vast improvement from the “Origins” release last year. I would only make three changes to make this whisky even better (and elevate it to 90+ status): a couple more years on oak bottling at 46% and not chill-filtering it. Still this is one of the best efforts from this distillery. Well done!"
4420,9,"Caol Ila makes unpeated whisky for blenders but it rarely gets bottled as a single malt. Here’s a very revealing opportunity to find out what Caol Ila tastes like without the smoke. Good viscosity and rather sweet showing thick honeyed vanilla gobs of fruit (lemon drops lime tart ripe Bartlett pear kiwi) mint jelly and cut grass. Its sea influence finally emerges towards the finish with brine and just a hint of seaweed. Bruichladdich and Bunnahabhain are now bottling peated whiskies and Caol Ila does just the opposite. This is an interesting diversion but I am missing the added dimension of peat smoke in this Caol Ila."
4421,6,"This unpeated version of Caol Ila was matured in refill American oak hogsheads. The nose is quite reticent with subtle vanilla and milk chocolate notes. Big fizzy-sweet fruit notes on the palate with caramel rock pools hot spices plain chocolate and very mild wood smoke. Bubble gum and peppery chocolate in the medium-length finish."
4422,6,"As it progresses toward the ultimate goal of an 18 year old expression in 2015 Arran has released a 16 year old matured in 30
percent sherry hogsheads and 70 percent bourbon casks. The edition is limited to 9000 bottles. The nose features malt milk chocolate and honey with a citric edge. The palate mirrors the nose with more malt honey and milk chocolate plus ginger nutmeg and spicy oak. Spiced fruits in the lengthy finish."
4423,6,"The latest single cask expression of 1991 Glen Scotia from Wemyss Malts has been matured for 22 years in a sherry butt which yielded 807 bottles. The nose provides sherry and cigar boxes cherries sultanas raisins orange peel plum pudding and finally warm leather. Full bodied with sherry on the palate plus brine dried fruit bitter coffee and polished old dark oak. Medium to long in the fruity finish with salt plain chocolate and wood polish notes. £105"
4424,10,"This noble Scot consists of a blend of 20 different whiskies and impresses with its nose of hazelnut dark chocolate vanilla pod menthol peppercorn and wisps of damp wood smoke. Warm chocolate fudge mellow spices dark burnished orange smooth oak old leather and malted milk. The mouthfeel is weighty enough to sustain the heavyweight flavors. Long finish of dark rum cocoa and spiced chocolate. Just add your own favorite leather armchair. Value pick."
4425,9,"Very similar in flavor profile to the Tomintoul 16 reviewed below but better. The longer aging has provided extra character and depth. Also on the palate the caramel flavors are a bit darker (bordering on toffee) and the whisky’s finish is longer and a shade drier. It has aged gracefully with no excessive woodiness. A whisky that reveals its charm slowly and subtly."
4426,9,"Matured in a bourbon cask. Cardhu has always been a pleasant but uninspiring whisky to me. This is one of the best Cardhu whiskies I’ve tasted -- richer and more distinctive. (At this price it had better be!) It’s clean and tight with orange tangerine lemon gumdrops ginger delicate honey butterscotch and vanilla with a dusting of powdered sugar. Straightforward pleasing finish. (252 bottles)  £250"
4427,6,"The House Stark bottling is presented with an image of a dire wolf on the label. The nose yields honey orange malt toffee and a suggestion of struck matches. Medium-bodied and sweet with red apples apricots milk chocolate and white pepper. Satsumas nutmeg milky cocoa and gingery oak in the medium-length finish."
4428,9,"Richer thicker and more lush than the 1975 vintage reviewed here. Fallen orchard fruit sticky toffee pudding and nuts with underlying suggestions of date cake. Emerging dried spice and oak resin towards the finish. A good contrast to the 1975 vintage."
4429,9,"Lush and fruity-the sherry cask aging is obvious-and it is balanced beautifully by the dry spicy oak notes. Through all this there’s inviting notes of ginger raisin and a whiff of peat. One of the best Glen Ord whiskies I’ve tasted."
4430,6,"This was aged in new American oak and selected for its faint smokiness believed to have been picked up from a previous peated spirit run. Pears white pepper and faint cigarette smoke on the nose. Full-bodied with lots of tropical fruit vanilla honey and a slightly antiseptic note. Long and peppery in the finish with more medicinal flavor. £500"
4449,1,"When approached from light to rich you can see how the driver of the range is oxidation rather than just the addition of wood. Here are stewed black cherries red plums and blueberries but with the purity and freshness of Amber and Gold. The mental image is of a country house in autumn: clay on boots candle wax resin allspice peels those perfumed fruits and the whiff of an artist’s palette. The tannins are supple. Best with water on the side. £66"
4431,9,"Like “Superstition” this is a peated expression of Jura. Compared to Superstition Prophecy seems richer heavier sweeter deeper leafier with more tarry notes. I’m also picking up more spice (cinnamon anise dark chocolate) and some fruit (lime mandarin orange green apple) with a subtle yet intriguing suggestion of burnt popcorn. Prophecy is also bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered—which I think brings out more subtle nuances and texture in the whisky. The only tradeoff is that I’m picking up less of the Jura spirit and less sea characteristics. But this is a small tradeoff considering how much more you’re getting with Prophecy. Promoted as a limited annual release."
4432,6,"Matured in bourbon casks this expression offers a sweet pleasing nose of honey icing sugar toffee bonbons and orange peel. Medium-bodied with barley sugar soft oak nectarine and lychee. Vanilla and a return of honey in the medium-length finish."
4433,9,"A new beefed-up version of the 18 year old with a higher alcohol level and (seemingly) more sherry influence. I must say that I really enjoyed the previous expression rating it an 87 for its roundness and elegance. I like this one too and its bold demeanor. Whether you like it or its predecessor comes down to preference and mood. Notes of toffee apple pancakes drizzled with maple syrup date nut cake ripe fruit and roasted nuts all dusted with cinnamon vanilla and cocoa."
4434,6,"A proportion of the component whiskies has been matured in virgin Black Sea oak casks while the rest has been aged in bourbon barrels. The nose is sweet with warm cloves and soft peat; a hint of brine. When it comes to the palate—curious! Menthol and herbal notes toasted oak plain chocolate sweet antiseptic. Mildly tannic in the finish with subtle peaty spiciness. An herbal peat note lingers long."
4435,6,"Distilled in 2013 from Scottish barley this 107 ppm 5 year old was matured entirely in first-fill American oak casks. Quite elemental on the nose with brine rock pool and cigarette ash aromas plus ginger and an ultimate hint of nougat. Peaches on the palate with lively spices roasted nuts oak and dark peat. The finish features licorice overt peat and black pepper. (42000 bottles)"
4436,6,"The youngest Octomore released to date 10.4 was distilled from Scottish barley peated to 88 ppm then aged for 3 years in 28 highly toasted virgin Limousin French oak casks. The nose offers vanilla new leather cloves sawdust and white pepper. Intense fruitiness on the palate with malt a medicinal note and more cloves. The finish yields dried fruits bitter oak and hot spices. (12000 bottles)"
4437,6,"Peated to 14.8 ppm this expression from anCnoc’s Peaty Collection falls between Rutter and Cutter in terms of its phenolic level. Immediately smoky on the nose with oily fudge and milky coffee. Well-balanced in the mouth with rich flavors of peat soft fruit and vanilla plus a hint of brine and iodine. The finish is lengthy with peat embers walnuts and more iodine."
4438,12,"A bit reticent on the nose with light aromas of jasmine freesia coconut vanilla and hints of kiwi pineapple and strawberry. The palate is oily and highlights more coconut pineapple vanilla and strawberry plus lemon sandalwood and mingled spices. On the finish crushed nuts top a chocolate and vanilla malted milkshake and lengthy oak caps things off. (156 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
4439,6,"Nectar D’Or is aged in bourbon barrels for 10 years before 2 years of finishing in sauternes wine casks. The nose offers apricots in syrup honey walnuts and ripe green grapes while the oily palate yields citrus fruits and honeyed cereal notes along with white pepper and wood spice. The finish is long and oaky with a fleeting return of apricots."
4440,9,"The first single cask release of GlenDronach for the U.S. by the new owners and a nice one at that. Silky in texture polished and clean on the palate with light toffee treacle cherry bonbon orange-soaked date nut cake and chocolate-covered raisin. Never cloying like some heavily-sherried whiskies can be. Silky soothing finish. Surprisingly soft and youthful for its age. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
4441,6,"This bottling of triple-distilled Hazelburn comprises spirit produced in 2003 and matured in unusually small casks known as rundlets and kilderkins. Malt chocolate and honey figure on the nose along with a contrasting marine note in the background. Unctuous and rich on the palate with soft fruit almonds brittle toffee and lots of spice. The finish is lengthy and earthy with caramel and vanilla notes ultimately being superseded by oak and sea salt. £60"
4442,9,"The subtle sherry adds an additional level of complexity when compared to the standard 10 year old taking Tomintoul to a new level. Rich and creamy with well-balanced notes of toffee vanilla fudge toasted nuts and elegant fruit. A surprisingly delicious whisky for 12 years old."
4443,6,"This is the seventh batch of 12 year old cask strength Springbank to appear being bottled early in 2014. Some of the component whisky was matured in oloroso sherry casks. The nose blends maritime notes with Christmas cake fruits vanilla pods and overt sherry. Viscous in the mouth with cowsheds and soft peat smoke plus spice caramel and a hint of sweet sherry. The no-holds-barred finish presents a big blast of smoke root ginger and freshly-dug peat. £45"
4444,6,"Like its Ledaig stablemate this Tobermory is offered non-chill filtered at cask strength. Finishing occurred in manzanilla sherry casks. Orange marmalade nutmeg and developing vanilla on the nose. Full bodied with a palate of citrus fruit and soft spices aniseed and developing tannins. Lingering in the finish with spicy plain chocolate. Ultimately the tannins fade and leave a fresh citric note."
4445,6,"The revival of Bladnoch Distillery in southwest Scotland continues with the launch of 15 and 25 year old expressions to add to the NAS Samsara (reviewed winter 2016). Talia has been finished in new American oak casks. Sweet and floral on the nose with violets Jaffa orange and fragrant fresh oak. Medium to full-bodied with rich fruit notes praline malt and finally raisins and prunes. Dark oak in the long mouth-drying finish."
4446,1,"Another example of the old ‘Strathspey’ style of whisky which predates the lighter more estery/floral style we have become accustomed to. Here distillery weight and time work in tandem to give a nose that has slightly overripe orchard fruits smoke and Seville orange. The palate then heads into the hedgerows—hawthorn and currant jam—before a waxiness emerges. The finish reveals a mix of smoke and mint. All in all an excellent dram. £425"
4447,1,"Highly fragrant and citric mixing dried and sweet orange peels moist sultana fruitcake. Lightly malty with gentle nuances of fruit syrup. Pretty and elegant in the mouth where there’s orange barley water mint and crystallized ginger on top of a thick honeyed delivery before the classic ‘Rothes sweet spices come through. Only a drop or two of water is needed. Recommended. £117"
4448,6,"Rose blossom vanilla and cocoa powder to start while sultana walnut and oloroso notes develop in time on the nose. Soft on the palate with tingling spices malt extract cake mix raisins dates figs and dark chocolate all set against relatively dry oak. Dates prunes and spicy dark chocolate in the lingering finish."
4451,1,"Light in color it may be but this is no wimp. The nose goes straight to the shore with mineral and salt but it’s also sweet which allows it to be fresh lively yet balanced. The palate delivers some menthol bay laurel more brininess a hint of malt and Parma violet. Everything remains very breezy with peat smoke being blown from a kiln into salt-laden air. I prefer it to the 12 year old and the price is fantastic."
4452,6,"Part of Glenmorangie’s Legends collection this was finished in casks that previously held sweet French white wines. Sweet red berries on the somewhat shy nose with developing low-key honey and vanilla. Nicely textured with a palate of honey caramel milk chocolate shortbread and lots of lively spice. Lengthy in the finish with more caramel and milk chocolate plus strawberry and ginger. (Travel Retail exclusive) £85"
4453,1,"It’s a brave person who tries to persuade a malt like Lagavulin to go into a different direction. Indeed even PX casks from the sweetest fortified wine of all can’t fully obscure the distillery’s character just give it a raisined coating. The creosote turns to tar and licorice while there’s Syrah-like sootiness and damson. This release is slightly less sweet than in the past and is the better for it though I still prefer my Lagavulin relatively ‘naked.’"
4454,6,"Glenglassaugh has launched its first cask-finished whiskies matured for an unspecified period in first- fill American oak casks before finishing for up to 2 years in secondary casks. This is the pick of the quartet of expressions with a nose of fragrant fruity smoke hand-rolling tobacco and new leather. Red berry fruits and woodsmoke feature on the palate while the finish offers gentle peat smoke cinnamon and black pepper. £60"
4455,1,"Part of an ongoing series and the first appearance of Port Charlotte. This ain’t shy. Assertive with banana roasted red pepper paprika and a hit of barbecued pork glazed with pomegranate molasses. The palate has blazing heat but also oiliness and real density. The peat doesn’t so much rumble as sit there in a cloud: opaque impenetrable. Even water cannot unlock it. Rooty and tarry this is not a dram for the fainthearted. £65 (500 ml)"
4456,9,"A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice I would love to see several single cask cask strength and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

The freshest of the bunch chock full of Springbank character. Light and lively. Floral with plenty of fruit (green grapes kiwi apple tart) on a bed of honeyed malt. Nuttiness and brine emerge toward the finish and linger."
4457,6,"This example of Rosebank was distilled in March 1992 a year before the distillery’s closure and bottled in December 2013. The cask yielded 141 bottles. The nose is light and mildly floral with ripe pears honey and vanilla. Firm and fruity on the surprisingly full palate with a sprinkling of white pepper plus summer berries and caramel. Tropical fruit soft spices and benign oak in the finish with a final flourish of licorice. £400"
4458,6,"After six ‘Work in Progress’ releases Kilkerran from Glengyle Distillery has finally come of age with this core expression. It comprises 70% whisky from first-fill bourbon casks and 30% from sherry casks. Floral on the nose with honey and a hint of brine then peaty fruit notes develop. The palate is confident and oily slightly earthy with tinned peaches black pepper cinnamon smoke and a suggestion of medicine chests. The finish is relatively long with pepper licorice and drying oak."
4459,9,"Very fragrant. Spicy too with notes of honeyed vanilla peaches in cream butterscotch cinnamon licorice (red and black) light nuttiness and toasted oak on the finish. Nice mouthfeel well-balanced and quite rich for such an elegant whisky."
4460,6,"Distilled in 2004 this 11 year old sherry cask-matured expression from Glengyle in Campbeltown is one of two final releases under the Work in Progress banner. 6000 bottles have been released. Fragrant wood fires fruity old leather damp tweed sherry malt and autumn berries on the nose. The palate is oily rich and rounded with zesty spice then peaches in syrup and sweet smokiness. The spices persist. The finish is long and warming with chili licorice and worn leather."
4461,9,"Deep gold color. Exotic aroma of tropical fruit (coconut pineapple) vanilla and honey. Medium bodied and firm. On the palate: honey vanilla and tropical fruit up front becoming dry with subtly complex spice notes. Deep dry lingering finish."
4462,9,"A good dose of sherry here but there’s plenty of Springbank character coming through too! Gobs of ripe red berried fruit (strawberry rhubarb red currant raspberry) especially on the nose along with raisin. It’s all on a bed of blueberry pancakes toffee and fig cake. Coconut and brine emerge occasionally on the palate and linger on the finish. A very nice whisky although I wonder what it would taste like with just a little less sherry influence?"
4463,1,"A wild aromatic opening — anise sweet cicely even a hint of wormwood — with more oak than the 21 year old but not in a dominating fashion rather just a framing device. Still fresh and acidic with touches of a bridal bouquet freshly baked warm sponge cake walnut flesh and with water a little bread-and-butter pudding. The acidity gives it a zippy clean palate zestiness with cumin and angelica. Beautifully balanced. £400"
4464,6,"Distilled with a portion of barley grown on the distillery’s Easter Elchies estate. The nose detects quite intense sherry plus black forest cake then warm leather and fresh-squeezed orange juice. Full sherry notes on the palate with new leather marzipan cherry liqueur furniture polish and dark chocolate. The finish yields bitter chocolate licorice nutmeg and tingling wood spices."
4465,9,"Lively on the nose for its age (and on the palate too -- the tell-tale oak emerges only towards the end). Notes of creamy vanilla barley sugar coconut pineapple and general citrus notes throughout. Dried spices (especially cinnamon) kick in mid-palate and continue into a lengthy dry polished oak finish."
4466,4,"This is to be a permanent addition to the core Caol Ila range but it will raise a few eyebrows completely ignoring the current peat battle between Ardbeg and Bruichladdich and heading off into an altogether more refined and delicate direction. This is a dignified and complex malt which doesn’t give everything up immediately. There’s soft pear and guava on the nose and the trademark oiliness and distinctive peat are there but there’s a buttery quality too as well as some brine and spice apple pip and traces of aniseed. You get a sense of its age late on with some oaky tannins and sharper spice but overall this is an unhurried complex and sweet whisky with just enough peat to keep it honest. Very impressive. (Limited general releases excluding the U.S.)"
4467,6,"Springbank has released a limited edition of 9000 bottles of whisky distilled in November 2001 matured in small casks (traditionally known as rundlets or kilderkins) and bottled in January 2012. The small casks have left an impression of accelerated maturity with coal smoke cloves young oak and caramel on the rich nose. The palate is big and bold with a sprinkling of salt then more youthful wood milk chocolate and honey while the finish is long and slightly tarry. £57"
4468,6,"Relatively dry on the nose with citrus fruit hazelnut and quite dry sherry. The palate is full and rich with sweeter sherry notes cinnamon and banoffee pie. Jaffa oranges hot chocolate and slightly tannic oak in the medium-length finish. Matured in oloroso casks."
4469,6,"Strong brine on the early nose with subtle peat red berry fruits and a beach barbecue. On the palate raspberries smoked over a peat fire then served with cream plus a slight meatiness. Citrus fruit char white pepper and cocoa powder in the finish."
4470,9,"Very fruity (peaches in syrup pineapple golden apple sultana) and satisfyingly rich in texture with coating vanilla marzipan and a potpourri of dried spice (especially on the nose and finish of the palate). Great balance too. Nicely done!"
4471,9,"Once again Lorne Mackillop demonstrates his talent for selecting whiskies with beautiful balance. This time it’s with a well-aged Glenlivet. Sure it shows many of the notes that I often find in Glenlivet (Speyside elegance peachy vanilla tropical fruit floral and honeyed-malt notes) but I’m also picking up more subtle notes: dark chocolate licorice root dark fruit perhaps even charcoal (especially on the finish) making the whisky a bit more complex and curiously attractive."
4472,6,"Probably the most highly-regarded malt in the regular Glengoyne lineup the 17 year old represents a direct progression from its younger siblings. According to the distillers “The balance has artfully changed. A more concentrated palate of flavors has emerged…” Citrus and cedar notes on the slightly grassy nose with a hint of plain chocolate. Medium in body with more plain chocolate notes plus raisins orange vanilla and malt. Lengthy in the finish with milky coffee sherry leather and citrus spice."
4473,6,"Isle of Arran distillers is now offering exclusive bottlings in the U.S. along the same lines as those already available in the UK starting with 16 year old single cask cask strength variants. Arran Premium Sherry Single Cask #1979 displays milk chocolate vanilla new leather wood polish and butterscotch on the nose. More vanilla in time. The palate is richly sherried with espresso fruit loaf nutmeg and old wood. Lively spices persist in the lingering leathery finish."
4474,1,"Is this bottled by Duncan Taylor or Ben & Jerry’s? Ludicrous amounts of white/milk chocolate and macadamia nut with green fennel underneath. With water it opens into dark chocolate chunks (see what I mean?) and cappuccino. One sip makes you worry you’re putting on weight such is the thickness of its impact. Okay it’s more about the wood rather than the distillery but you can’t deny that it puts a smile on your face. Completely bonkers and somehow wonderful. £49"
4475,1,"As befits an elder of the church this has a serious attitude which with the youngest component being 18 years old isn’t a surprise. Full-bodied but with elegance not bludgeoning power this is a refined Rothes: malted barley creamy oak oxidative depths. Sweet with stewed plums and red fruit. The palate is unctuous with little hints of geranium and becomes slightly funky with water though I’d go neat to get the full effect of bitter orange and sweet honeycomb. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €99"
4476,6,"As with its sherry wood-matured sibling this 10 year old release comprises 9000 bottles and was distilled using the same lightly peated malt and bottled without chill filtration. Lemongrass a pinch of salt wood smoke and ginger snaps on the nose. Tropical fruits on the soft slightly oily palate with a slight underpinning of spicy smoke. Nutty drying with mellow spice in the finish."
4477,6,"The nose is floral with honey toffee cereal and a hint of smoke but subtle maritime notes are also present. The palate is rich and relatively complex: spicy with citrus fruit more cereal seaweed peat smoke and oak. Lengthy in the finish with toffee new leather and perpetual spice. A long-standing favorite with a very distinctive profile."
4478,6,"Artein is the third release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition range with ‘artein’ being Gaelic for stone. The expression comprises two-thirds 15 year old and one-third 21 year old whisky finished in ‘Super Tuscan’ wine casks. Briefly pear drops then vanilla on the nose with developing peaches and apricots shot through with mild ginger. Viscous mouth-coating intense dark fruits spice aniseed and late onset of cloves and blackcurrant cough medicine on the palate. The finish is fruity long and herbal."
4479,1,"The youngest of the Manse Brae triumvirate and also the freshest. Here is Rothes at its liveliest with sweet cereal and the typical spiciness of the distillery undercut by citrus peels dessert apples and hot malted milk. On the tongue it is quite delicate but it is how it behaves mid-palate which is the killer just stopping and allowing the fruits to liquefy in the center of the tongue. Fantastic price as well. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €40"
4480,6,"Like its 15 year old sibling this was matured in bourbon casks before being finished in first-fill European oak butts. The spicy nose yields toffee sherry and poached pears. The palate is supple spicy and slightly herbal with dried fruits then big caramel vanilla and orange notes develop. The finish is quite dry and earthy with oak and a hint of chile."
4481,6,"The Dalmore Cromartie was distilled in 1996 and has been matured in oloroso sherry casks. The release is limited to 7500 bottles. A floral nose with cocoa powder and warm leather along with hand-rolling tobacco and gingery citrus notes. Rich and elegant sherry notes on the palate with soft smoky treacle and dark chocolate-covered orange candy. The finish is long and spicy majoring on cinnamon with more dark chocolate overripe orange and a hint of licorice. £100"
4482,1,"Bottled as 350 ml twin-pack along with the American oak version this is deeply resinous with clove shoe leather high-grade engine oil—an Aston Martin workshop not a back alley garage—alongside dried fruits. Similar in tone to some old Caribbean rums with liqueur chocolate and Friar’s Balsam. The tannins yield slightly showing chicory and raisin. ‘Old style’ Macallan and another which while strong is best neat. £350"
4483,6,"Lemon juice tide pools roasted pork and peat embers mingle on the nose. Smoky toffee in time. Canned peach slices in syrup over woodsmoke on the palate; buttery smoked fish lots of energetic spices. The finish is fruity with aniseed and lingering spices."
4505,6,"Matured in first-fill bourbon barrels this youthful Talisker appears at one of the original bottling strengths used by one-time owners John Walker & Sons Ltd. It is the first Special Releases Talisker since 2013. Peppery tweed ozone coconut oil and subtle smoke on the nose. The palate features woodsmoke and chili toffee and green berries. White pepper sea salt and a savory note in the finish. £70"
4484,6,"Following the initial release of a 1997 vintage Balblair in 2007 a second edition has now been launched with the spirit in question having benefited from an additional five years’ maturation in first-fill bourbon barrels. Fresh light and fruity on the nose: tinned peaches pear drops sweet apples plus vanilla and wood putty. The palate features lots of succulent soft fruits milk chocolate honey and spice. The finish is medium in length and spicy chocolate notes persist. £55"
4485,6,"An upfront classic single malt from an undisclosed Islay distillery launched to coincide with the opening of Hunter Laing’s Ardnahoe Distillery. Overt peat smoke on the nose with brine citrus spices vanilla and mild antiseptic. Stewed fruits and bonfire embers on the palate with new leather and rich spice notes. The slightly medicinal finish features peppery oak."
4486,6,"This variant of Glengoyne replaces the popular 17 year old as part of an overhaul of the core range and the maturation regime has included what the distillers describe as “a generous proportion of first-fill sherry casks.” Milk chocolate vanilla melon and grapefruit on the nose with burgeoning dry sherry and fruitcake. The palate is rich and well rounded with cinnamon and ginger almonds orange marmalade sweeter sherry and caramel. Lingering spices and easy-going oak in the lengthy finish. £70"
4487,6,"Strawberry jam and heather honey on the nose with subtle woodsmoke vanilla and pineapple. Bold tropical fruits on the palate with toffee red berries and more soft woodsmoke. The medium-length finish highlights licorice and drying oak."
4488,6,"WK217 is the latest in Pulteney’s Travel Retail-exclusive range of releases named after the registrations of fishing vessels. This expression has been matured in a mix of Spanish and American oak sherry butts. Fig rolls black treacle sultanas and a hint of cinnamon on the nose. Finally milk chocolate. Smooth and oily on the palate with soft spices before deeper and darker sherry notes arrive. The finish is relatively long with sherry and spice then final spiky licorice notes. £40 (liter)"
4489,6,"Matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. A whiff of brine on the early nose with damp earth citrus fruit cereal and mildly smoky oak. The palate is supple and offers vanilla toffee cedarwood hazelnuts and more brine. A spicy finish yields coconut and a hint of dry peat."
4490,6,"Just 450 bottles of this year’s offering are available. Aged in a mixture of Madeira muscatel and port casks with a final spell in first-fill bourbon barrels. Warm caramel spiced orange peach blossom and black pepper on the complex nose. Nicely textured on the palate; initially fondant-sweet then nutmeg Jaffa orange ginger and milk chocolate emerge. Relatively lengthy in the finish with sultanas leather a hint of plain chocolate and lingering black pepper. £150"
4491,9,"Deep gold color. This whisky is finished off in new oak and it certainly shows. There are lots of complex wood spices in this whisky and it is intensely deep and mature for such a young age. There’s a firmness to the whisky that’s very appealing. It is exciting too with notes of toasted oak vanilla and a hint of dark chocolate."
4492,6,"Tomatin has introduced a permanently-available 36 year old expression and the first batch comprises 800 bottles. Matured in a combination of bourbon and oloroso sherry casks this expression has not been chill-filtered. Milk chocolate and vanilla on the early nose with background apricots malt and ginger. Ultimately citrus fruit and sherry. Good mouth-feel lively sweet fruits cloves and more ginger on the palate. Long in the finish drying slowly to fruity licorice and plain chocolate."
4493,7,"Peated whiskies definitely have a dropping off point where they become too old and tired and the nose for this one would indicate it’s past its prime with gravel rubbery smoke and raisin. On the palate it’s a different story as ashy smoke combines with raisin and rancio turning the peat age detriment into an asset. Strangely alluring it’s like sitting on a park bench next to a weathered old man who ends up having a real tale to tell.  (U.S. only)"
4494,6,"A single cask cask strength whisky finished in a first-fill bourbon barrel. The initial nose is slightly earthy with walnuts Juicy Fruit gum vanilla and ripe peach notes in time. Full sweet fruit notes on the palate peaches in syrup overripe pineapple with milk chocolate fudge and nutmeg. The finish is medium in length and perennially spicy with aniseed notes. (Cask no. 170)"
4495,6,"Aged in bourbon wood then finished in an oloroso sherry cask. The result is a whisky with a nutty nose plus sultanas figs vanilla and background sherry becoming more floral in time. Full-bodied on the palate with sweet sherry notes ginger and cinnamon and developing raisin and prune notes. The finish is long with spicy coffee and blackberries. (Cask no. 900160)"
4496,6,"Aged in American oak Pedro Ximénez and oloroso casks. The nose is nutty with treacle and developing geranium aromas. Prunes and dates plus almonds on the buttery palate. Drying in the finish with nutmeg and wood spice. (1200 bottles for U.S.)"
4497,6,"The oldest bottling in the range this was aged in a combination of Pedro Ximénez oloroso and American oak casks. Farmyard aromas with oak and dark chocolate. Very smooth and supple on the palate with orange marmalade raisins and old oak. The finish is quite short with dried fruit and milky coffee. (160 bottles for U.S.)"
4498,6,"This ever-popular expression of Balvenie is matured for roughly 12 years in ex-bourbon casks and finished for 9 months in Spanish oak oloroso sherry casks. Floral on the nose with honey oak and almonds. Spicy sherry nutmeg and dried fruit on the silky palate. Quite long in the finish with a hint of orange plus drying spices. Elegant yet robust."
4499,6,"Just 279 bottles of this 22 year old single cask Glen Scotia have been released by Wemyss Malts with maturation taking place in a bourbon cask. Fleetingly very sweet crunchy apples on the nose then caramel milk chocolate sherbet dips plus a hint of brine. The palate is sweet and peppery with spicy toffee grapefruit melon and walnuts. The finish is medium in length spicy with table salt in the tail. £90"
4500,6,"This was aged in a mixture of bourbon and oloroso sherry casks followed by a final spell of marrying in wooden tuns. Dried fruits dark chocolate figs and cinnamon on the nose. The palate yields rich caramel and toffee-apple notes plus ginger cloves and medium sherry. More dried fruits cookies and a sprinkling of allspice in the slightly smoky medium to long finish."
4501,6,"A mix of American and Spanish oak casks was used to mature this addition to the core range. A big blast of orchard and tropical fruits characterizes the early nose along with honey vanilla and toffee. The palate also majors in fruit this time principally oranges plus caramel cinnamon milk chocolate and lots of vanilla. The finish is quite short with banana and ginger."
4574,9,"Lush and fruity. Sappy with waxed fruit golden raisin plum and nectarine rock candy. Mouth-clinging finish. Definitely post-prandial after a hearty meal. (With a cigar perhaps?) (Loch & K(e)y retailer exclusive)"
4506,7,"A 15 year old port cask-matured Ben Nevis that is as genre-defying as it gets. Deep port notes combine with strong iodine honey and malt in an inviting nose. This whisky simply roars on the palate with big jammy fruit combined with salt iodine and a dash of smoke. Everything comes together in the mid-palate with an alluring core of ginger honey and malt. A long flavorful finish wraps up a whisky with unique character and unmistakable appeal. (U.S. only)"
4507,6,"This was aged in refill American oak barrels and bodega European oak butts followed by what Diageo describes as a “unique maturation and marrying process involving five cask types.” The nose is soft and sweet presenting malt ginger milk chocolate and vanilla. Orchard fruits surface in time. Supple in the mouth with toffee ripe peaches gingerbread and old leather. Dark berries char and black pepper in the finish. £100"
4508,6,"Tùsail—apparently Gaelic for ‘originary’—is the sixth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition collection. It was distilled using floor-malted Maris Otter winter barley once ubiquitous in the British brewing industry but now practically a rare breed. Oily on the nose notably linseed then becoming more floral. Cinnamon ginger snaps and faint new leather. Viscous on the palate with poached pears cloves nutmeg and polished oak. Drying nutty oak in the finish. £76"
4509,6,"This was matured in second-fill sherry casks and then spent 3 years in first-fill Pedro Ximénez butts. The nose features fruit and nutty milk chocolate fudge sultanas and mixed candied peel. Lush sweet sherry on the palate with a carryover of fudge and sultanas from the nose. Long in the nutty spicy finish which offers nutmeg and peppery oak. (5000 bottles)"
4510,6,"Distilled in 2012 this was aged in casks sourced from the Douro Valley in Portugal. Quite reticent on the early nose with developing strawberries vanilla custard new oak and subtle smoke. The palate offers smoky red wine notes with ashy peat spices and tingling black pepper becoming more apparent. Sweet cherry fruitiness lingers in the relatively long finish with prickly spices."
4511,6,"This Clynelish is notable as the first no age statement Special Release and maturation took place in refill European and bodega European oak casks along with first-fill refill and rejuvenated American oak casks. The nose is fresh and salty with olives pine and lemongrass then fruit notes ranging from citric to sweet. Oily on the palate with those same citric and sweet fruits as the nose plus cayenne pepper and vanilla. Spicy citrus fruits in the drying finish."
4512,6,"As part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its Scotch whisky distilleries Bacardi subsidiary John Dewar & Sons has now released a trio of bottlings from Royal Brackla situated near Nairn in the Scottish Highlands. The 12 16 and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets Including the UK U.S. and Canada.
Richer and more complex than its younger sibling with waxy peel glacé cherries sherry sultanas and custard. Silky smooth in the mouth with marshmallows milk chocolate medium-sweet sherry and stem ginger. Tingling spices allied to darkening chocolate and a touch of smoke in the medium to long finish. Finally a fat buttery note."
4513,6,"An unusual vintage bottling of Old Pulteney in that maturation occurred in a mix of American bourbon casks and Spanish sherry casks that previously held heavily-peated whisky. The nose opens with a whiff of ozone; then lemon vanilla and coconut appear along with fleeting wood smoke. Intense tropical fruitiness merges with milk chocolate lemon sorbet and lively spices on the palate. Spicy milk chocolate with a citric and softly peaty tang in the finish."
4514,6,"Old Pulteney’s 40 year old comprises spirit from three sherry hogsheads and one bourbon barrel. Just 493 bottles of the distillery’s oldest expression to date have been released offered at cask strength and not chill filtered. The nose is soft and fragrant with peaches in syrup toffee cinnamon and aerosol wood polish. Early intense orchard fruits on the palate then nutmeg cinnamon and black coffee. Long in the finish with spicy oak tannins and Seville orange. Notably drying."
4515,6,"The nose opens with brine fresh pine sage and sweet antiseptic. Peat ginger black pepper lime and lemon notes develop in time. Citrus fruits caramel and a peat-fueled barbecue on the palate with background dark berries. The finish is medium in length warming and spicy with plain chocolate and drying crumbly peat. (Cask no. 13; 275 bottles)"
4516,6,"The nose offers early grassiness then vanilla Jaffa orange toffee apple and honey. A smooth palate delivery with more orange and toffee apple plus almonds and caramel. The finish is long with white pepper and sweet oak."
4517,6,"Spicy on the nose with deep full tropical fruit notes praline and marzipan. The palate is silky with fudge and raisins then cherry liqueur. The finish yields dark chocolate and citrus fruit plus peppery oak."
4518,6,"This expression of Jura is by leading London wine and spirits merchant Berry Bros. & Rudd and was bottled in the company’s Berry’s Own range at 35 years of age after maturation in sherry hogshead #889. The nose offers sweet sherry and caramel sultanas cinnamon and rum baba with an elusive wisp of smoke. Full-bodied very fruity on the palate with mixed spices pine cones and old sherry notes. The finish is long nutty and luxurious. £200"
4519,12,"Enjoy fresh aromas in multiple ways like fruit (melon pear blueberry) and a sea breeze (oyster shell salty). Full flavors of tangerine Bosc pear salted pistachio white pepper dried ginger and mint are diminished only by the light body. The finish is particularly satisfying but a little more heft would make it shine. (Total Wine & More)"
4520,6,"Odin is the fourth and final release in Highland Park’s Valhalla Collection. It has been aged in a combination of first-fill Spanish oak sherry casks and refill hogsheads with the former predominating. The nose yields cocoa powder insistent spice subtle sweet smoke heather honey and rum-and-raisin fudge. Rich and fruity on the palate with lively dark spices plus treacle and peat smoke. The lingering finish initially offers smoky sherry then dries with licorice and oak. (17000 bottles)"
4521,6,"This addition to the Port Askaig range is presented with natural color without chill filtration and matured in refill American oak casks. The nose presents light peat ozone and faint medicinal notes becoming saltier and spicier with time. Bracing. Woodsmoke kippers grapefruit and lime on the palate. The finish is sweet with receding smoke."
4522,6,"After initial maturation in first-fill bourbon barrels this 2006 vintage from Tullibardine was transferred into marsala wine casks for a year of finishing. The nose offers vanilla ginger printer’s ink red wine plums milk chocolate and walnuts. Rich red-berry fruit flavors on the palate—raspberries and cream—plus coffee and cloves. Black treacle and dark chocolate in the slightly earthy finish. Accomplished."
4523,6,"Pear drops green apples lots of toffee and more spice on the nose than in the Sigurd expression; also fresher and fruitier. Voluptuous mouthfeel with sherry toffee vanilla nutmeg and a wisp of fragrant smoke. Toffee remains in the finish with notes of cocoa powder smoky oak and citrus spice. Very well balanced.(Travel Retail exclusive.) €400"
4524,6,"This expression was distilled in 2003 and after undergoing a period of finishing in amoroso sherry casks it was bottled in 2014. Fleeting green apples on the nose before sweetening with figs sultanas red berries and chili. Peat smoke finally makes its presence felt. Full-bodied on the palate with spicy smoke dark chocolate peaches and Jaffa orange; the additional fruitiness courtesy of the amoroso cask influence. Long and softly smoky in the finish with ginger and lingering fruit notes. £55"
4525,6,"This limited-edition bottling was matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. It is non-chill filtered and includes no caramel coloring. Vanilla milk chocolate dried fruits and green apples on the nose. Relatively light-bodied with orange juice honey wood spice and a hint of brine on the soft oaky palate. The finish is medium in length gently fruity with mixed nuts and salted caramel."
4526,9,"Glenmorangie enters the world of peated whiskies (like everyone else these days it seems — not that I’m complaining). Richly textured layers of sweetness (vanilla toffee milk chocolate) fruit (tangerine orchard fruit — especially ripe cherry) roasted nuts wild morels a hint of menthol and gentle smoke. Certainly entertaining even if the whisky doesn’t always seem to know what it wants to be. The soft sweetness mid-palate is balanced nicely by dried spice and smoke on the finish. Curiously enjoyable."
4527,6,"Jura has introduced a new house style of ‘sweetness and smoke’ and this spent 18 years in bourbon barrels with a finish in red wine casks. Malt peach blossom raspberries vanilla and dark chocolate on the nose. The palate offers red berries more chocolate cloves and peat. Dry red wine notes in the finish with fruity spices and black pepper."
4528,9,"Similar in flavor to the Aberfeldy 12 reviewed below but with more depth. There’s more orange rind in the marmalade notes along with Clementine and coconut. The whisky finishes drier too with a spicy flair. Still quite clean and nicely balanced throughout. A whisky for those of you who want a fun whisky that’s not heavy on the palate."
4529,9,"A robust Speysider — and very tactile too (clinging to the palate) but with no excessive oak. Vanilla and some dark chocolate notes along with coating (yet ironically dry-ish) honey notes. But its biggest flavor note is citrus — particularly lemon along with some tangerine and a hint of pineapple — which helps to cut through the thickness. Good depth with dried spice polished oak and a wisp of smoke on the finish. (Bottled in 2004 but only recently released to the U.S.)"
4530,9,"Richly sherried great mouthfeel and well-balanced. The sherry is clean and is only one facet of this multi-dimensional whisky. Notes of lush orange and apricot soaked in molasses and maple syrup. Fig cake and oak resin add structure and complexity. Dry spicy cinnamon resinous finish. (Bottled for Delilah’s and for Bull and Bush)"
4531,9,"Honey creamy vanilla caramel sultana and toasted almond along with a hint of lemon gum drops and banana. Quite floral too -- lavender heather -- with a gentle lingering finish. A very soothing mouth-coating whisky with excellent balance while still quite fresh. Indeed a very more-ish whisky -- and sneaky in how it grows on you with each sip."
4532,6,"Distilled in 1992 a year before Rosebank fell silent this 21 year old expression was matured in refill American oak casks. 4530 bottles have been released. The fragrant nose yields milk chocolate peaches apricots nutmeg and toffee bonbons. Spicy and mildly herbal on the palate with icing sugar and a suggestion of dark chocolate. The finish is medium in length fruity with gentle spice coffee and developing oaky dryness."
4533,9,"(Reviewers note: this is an exclusive bottling to Park Avenue Liquors New York NY.) This is signature Ardbeg: young (but not too young) bold and with an attitude too! Its flavors are reminiscent of crumbled peat thrown on a campfire with notes of damp earth pepper and seaweed. Still there’s a soft underbelly of vanilla sweetness that helps to tame this beast and provide balance. A peppery kippered smoky finish entertains long after the whisky disappears. Make this your last whisky of the evening."
4534,1,"The nose is redolent with the smells of autumn jam — slowly stewing dark berry fruits — but there’s a hint of hazelnut adding a drier edge alongside some waxed paper. As it opens out comes argan oil. This constantly changing array of aromas is very Glenrothes as is the vanilla lift when water is added which comes with added cordite. The palate is very sweet filled with fruit syrups and even some dried rose petal. The finish long. £79"
4535,6,"Distilled in September 2007 and matured in a first-fill bourbon barrel (#5315) this is a fine example of how good a relatively youthful Speyside malt can be given the right cask. Soft and fragrant on the nose with lemongrass ginger snaps and light toffee notes. The palate is sweet with ripe strawberries and spicy fudge. A spicy finish offers cinnamon milk chocolate and lingering citrus fruits. (220 bottles)"
4536,9,"An elder Lagavulin. Thirty years of oak aging has mellowed this whisky. Fragrant and floral with suggestions of perfumed soap. Spicy too with cinnamon and anise. Classic leafy smoky notes along with some tarry rope emerge on the palate and maintain a steady keel as they work their way through an ocean of vanilla malt. Lingering finish of burning embers. Certainly an enjoyable Lagavulin but I still like the standard 16 year old better. It’s hard to improve on a classic."
4537,1,"Though sounding more like a character out of Asterix than a whisky Authenticus is the code for the peated arm of the ever-expanding BenRiach portfolio. It’s the smoke that you notice first typically Highland-style wood smoke with a light aromatic lift akin to smoked meat. It’s not a bludgeoning smoke however because BenRiach’s inherent orchard fruit sweetness is there alongside touches of beeswax. In other words it has maturity. The key here is balance and harmony. £124"
4538,9,"Straw gold color. Peat smoke damp earth seaweed balanced by a maple syrup sweetness on the nose and palate. Full-bodied and firm in body. Flavors are pleasantly mature and nicely integrated."
4539,6,"Matured in second-fill bourbon casks this expression of Balblair offers a distinctive aroma of bananas along with cooking apples sultanas nuts and spices. It is full-bodied and exhibits a palate of toffee and spicy fruits and becomes increasingly chocolate-y with distinct cocoa notes when given time to breathe. Raisin notes also develop. The finish is lengthy and smooth with lasting lively spice and vanilla."
4575,6,"Warm machine oil on the early nose slightly herbal with apricots and vanilla
emerging in time. Slick on the palate with light smoke honey delicate spices and
eventually burnt toffee. The finish features licorice pipe tobacco and white pepper.
Ultimately mouth-drying. £170"
4540,9,"The Balvenie continues its limited edition releases of 17 year old whiskies. Previous editions included an Islay Cask finish and a New Oak finish. This is the newest one aged in sherry oak casks. It’s a delicious whisky with clean ripe sherried fruit marrying nicely with the dry oak spices. Notes of apple pie honeyed summer fruit caramel toasted almonds and toffee with dry resinous oak on the finish to round out the sweetness. A big full-bodied Balvenie that satisfies."
4541,1,"These days the mighty Mortlach is a known quantity but Diageo’s two other meaty sites—Benrinnes and Dailuaine—remain in the shadows. This is big boisterous and sherried but there’s less of the gravy-browning elements you get from the other two; at Dailuaine it is fruit that is promoted alongside Seville orange treacle and the inevitable raisin and date. There are nods to PX sherry as well. Every bit as good as Mortlach.  £43"
4542,9,"Pungent and medicinal in personality with gobs of peat tar iodine brine and seaweed. These are all good things.in case you were wondering. A gentle vanilla sweetness tries to tame this savage beast but it is no match. One of the most challenging-yet rewarding-whiskies in the entire world. What Cantillion Lambic is to beer Laphroaig Original Cask Strength is to whisky."
4543,6,"Distilled in October 1995 this single cask was aged in a refill hogshead (#10206). Primrose ginger cedar spice and malt on the nose with a hint of salt and background heather; complex. Slightly oily on the palate with orchard fruits milk chocolate a suggestion of brine and developing cloves. Dries quite rapidly in the finish with more cloves and light oak tannins. (190 bottles)"
4544,9,"Pale gold color. Bold aromas of sweet wort seaweed and peat bonfires. Medium bodied and slightly oily in texture. Malty sweet flavors up front followed by peat and seaweed then taken over by a huge rush of peat smoke that never seems to end. A sweetness stays with the whisky throughout to help balance the peat smoke."
4545,6,"Triple Cask replaced Macallan’s Fine Oak range in 2018 and was matured in a combination of European and American sherry-seasoned oak and American oak bourbon barrels. The entry level 12 year old offers a relatively light zesty nose with citrus fruit vanilla and ginger while the palate yields more citrus fruit and vanilla honey sweet oak and dark chocolate. Cantaloupe and wood spice in the finish."
4546,6,"This refill sherry butt-matured cask strength variant of the Lowland classic Rosebank was distilled in December 1990. Floral and fruity on the nose. Sweet with malt and black cherries plus a hint of new leather. Quite viscous in the mouth; nutmeg dark chocolate and toffee on the palate. Walnuts and background dry sherry. The finish offers gentle oak and lots of spice."
4547,6,"Distilled in Scotland’s most southerly distillery of Bladnoch in October 1992 this bottling has been matured in a refill hogshead and 150 bottles have been allocated to the U.S. It presents a fresh nose with initial herbal notes turning to cornflakes and newly-mown hay. Sweet and fruity on the palate with oat biscuits and milk chocolate. The finish is relatively short with spicy custard then a final fruit flourish."
4548,9,"Also known as St. Magdalene this Lowland distillery which closed down for good in 1983 is becoming increasingly more difficult to find. And when one does become available it will be pushing 20 years old or older like this one. When young Linlithgow often exhibits a freshness and drinkability with a gentle maltiness and often hay or grassy notes for complexity. How does this older one fare? Quite well actually. I was concerned that this whisky would have too much oak influence given how old it is and how delicate the whisky can be. While those years in a hogshead add some dry spicy notes they are never excessive. Instead they add a complexity that blends in nicely with notes of creamy malt vanilla lemon gum drops grass and hay. I am particularly impressed by the evolution of flavors on the palate and the length and depth of its dry spicy finish. Certainly one of the best Linlithgows to come onto the market."
4549,9,"One of the better bottlings from this Lowland distillery which closed in 1983. Velvety and slightly oily in texture and fragrant. The whisky is balanced the flavors clean with no hint of excessive oak. Bourbon cask-aging offers up notes of vanilla wafer along with coconut cream honey and a touch of caramel. Bright fruit (lemon meringue pineapple apricot) keeps the whisky lively and suggestions of hay and linseed offer continued entertainment. Nutty toasted oak finish. If you are looking for a Linlithgow (AKA St. Magdalene) to purchase before the whisky becomes impossible to find I can recommend this one."
4550,9,"White wine color. Sweet aromas of confectioner’s sugar toasted marshmallow honey and coconut. Its flavors mirror its aroma with a pleasing creamy almost buttery texture and soft gentle finish."
4551,6,"This new core expression was launched in 2019 to celebrate the reopening of Tobermory Distillery after two years of remodeling. The whisky was matured principally in bourbon barrels with a small proportion being finished in virgin oak. The nose yields honeycomb vanilla fudge orange blossom and cinnamon. Quite full-bodied with cloves on the early palate apricots and malt. Licorice spicy dark berries and more cloves in the finish. (£46)"
4552,6,"The nose yields orange and lime canned pineapple and light caramel notes. Elegant with some substance on the palate with vanilla and brittle toffee underpinned by vibrant orchard fruits honey and milk chocolate. The finish features more milk chocolate gentle oak and ginger. Best Value"
4553,9,"Aged in a refill sherry puncheon and the sherry is evident in appearance and on the palate. Soft and sweet with caramel-coated mixed nuts toffee apple rhum agricole currant (red and black) plum cinnamon and surprising brisk mint (especially toward the finish). A pleasing non-aggressive expression of a mature sherried whisky. (Not available in the U.S.)£340"
4554,9,"This whisky combines the finer qualities of both the 18 year old and the 25 year old. It expresses the balance and purity of the 18 year old while showing maturity found in the 25 year old. The lack of chill-filtering enhances the whisky’s vibrancy and like all the Benromachs it’s mouth-coatingly thick and malty."
4555,10,"Dried peat smoke a papery column of cigar ash sizzling bacon fat baked earth and a shower of sea spray coupled with hints of fresh peach and ripe fruits. The palate has a light oily consistency ingrained with smokiness throughout tasting of vanilla toffee pick ‘n’ mix foam bananas tangy citrus and sweet tropical fruits the whole arrangement given a peppery lift before succumbing to a late nuttiness. It’s not named after the Gaelic for smoky for nothing you know."
4556,6,"This is the first release in the distillery’s new core range for the U.S. After primary maturation in bourbon barrels the 10 year old whisky undergoes a sherry cask finish. Orange marmalade pine nuts white pepper and very subtle smokiness on the nose. The palate majors in overripe Jaffa oranges ginger and milk chocolate. The milk chocolate darkens in the medium-length finish with coffee grounds and warming spice."
4557,1,"A single oloroso cask bottling so an interesting comparison with the Loch Gorm (see below). The cask has more of an influence here with plummy fruits fig rolls and Medjool dates. The smoke is restrained and foggy allowing some seashore breezes to come through. The palate reverses this with the smoke rolling in first then the soft dark and sweet fruits treacle and garam masala. Tannins are very soft. Kilchoman with heft. (637 bottles) £90"
4558,9,"Gold color. Citrus zest aromas and creamy sweet notes-reminiscent of lemon meringue pie-with subtle tropical fruit and marshmallow notes dancing throughout. This whisky has great balance and is fully mature at 12 yrs. which should be no surprise for a Lowland whisky. The palate delivers what the aroma promises with a touch of honey up front citrus and vanilla in the middle and a delicate dryness on the finish. I've always admired Bladnoch-a whisky that needs to be better known-and this expression reinforces my opinion."
4559,1,"A refill sherry hoggie has given a classic walnut color and indeed notes of that nut as well. Here’s Glenfarclas at its most dense with savory sun-dried tomato-like edges and sandalwood. The mouth is elegant with a little heat the sherry giving roasted almond sweet plump dried fruits and dried flowers. Water brings out lightly gripping tannins (but again not aggressively) and good layering. Similar to the ’87. £285"
4560,10,"A rich fruity nose of baked apple fruitcake sliced almond honey and white pepper. At cask strength this is quite a bumpy ride with warm apple sultana and caramel revving up to a jagged peak of ginger pepper and clove. When your taste buds emerge on the other side it settles into a more pleasing caramel and toffee sweetness. Perfect for armchair mountaineers."
4561,10,"Lime syrup grapefruit peel Smarties candy ripe peach and orange peel zested over vanilla frosting make for an attractive nose. Fruity and tangy with green apple lemon vanilla burnt oak clove and pepper developing more candy sweetness than fruit flavors in the latter phases. As the spiciness blooms extra layers of vanilla and toffee are added. A tangy fruit finish with a citrus edge."
4562,9,"Nice to see stocks distilled after the 1980s ‘silent period’ turning 18 years old. The sherry influence here is complementary but not overpowering. Notes of toffee almond vanilla fudge chocolate-coated citrus bramble and candied ginger. Polished leather dried spice and a hint of brine on the finish dries it out nicely and keeps it interesting. Not quite as dynamic and complex as some of those legendary pre-1980s Springers but it’s smooth well-rounded and more-ish."
4563,6,"A period of finishing in a combination of Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry puncheons and hogsheads distinguishes this release. The nose is fragrant with spicy red wine raspberries ginger milk chocolate and nutmeg. Viscous on the palate with lots of cloves plus vanilla raisins and instant coffee with a slug of sherry in it. Dark chocolate licorice and black coffee feature in the finish. Overall nicely balanced."
4564,1,"This new member of the core range is wholly from stock produced by the distillery’s new(ish) owner. It has a gentle sweet honeycomb nose with some banana a little malt and lemon freshness. The palate shows light honey/honeysuckle at the start and is well balanced with maltiness and a signature spicy finish adding a dry counterpoint to the sweetness from the cask and a distillate with good weight. Good price as well. Lovely."
4565,1,"There’s no doubt that this is from Glenlivet; there’s still that pure combination of fruit and flowers now given a little nudge toward a more concentrated expression: the flowers are dried and heathery the fruits tinned pineapple windfall apples. An added cedar/nutmeg note adds to the complexity. Liquorous and tongue-clinging with custard tart notes before the autumn fruits come through. A sense of the curtains being drawn and a settling in for the winter. Recommended."
4566,6,"The first peated expression from Glnglassaugh after reopening in 2008 Torfa is made from barley malted to 20 ppm and matured in bourbon barrels. Bonfire smoke ozone orchard fruits malt and black pepper are present on the nose. Slightly savory on the smooth palate with sweet peat smoke honey dark chocolate and a very mild maritime note. Ginger apricot and more sweet peat in the finish."
4567,6,"Apricots and candle wax aromas on the early nose with honey caramel and a hint of
cinnamon. Supple on the palate with juicy peaches ripe banana malt licorice and
wood spices. The finish is long with aniseed spicy oak dark chocolate and black
pepper. (1468 bottles) £65"
4568,6,"This latest release comprises the contents of nine first-fill European sherry-seasoned oak hogsheads eight bourbon barrels and nine refill casks all laid down in 1998. Hints of warm machine oil and herbs on the nose with pineapple barley sugar and white pepper plus a touch of heather and faint smokiness. Slightly bitter on the palate with wood spices while fruitiness lurks in the background. Peppery oak char and coal in the finish."
4569,1,"A sweet start then a sudden blast of fresh menthol-like toothpaste (pleasant) before it dips into slightly decaying soft fruits (again nice) a mashy note then violet-accented smoke. Water adds some elegance and weight. This sweetness continues on the palate where there’s toffee raisin ripe fruits and slow-burning peatiness fully integrated and ember-like on the back palate. The finish is all hot peppered mackerel. Recommended. (U.S. only)"
4570,6,"Tarlogan is the third and most recent release in Glenmorangie’s Legends Collection. Some of the component whisky had been matured in virgin oak casks while the remainder was aged in bourbon barrels. A hint of freshly-dug soil on the very early nose then toffee apples malt and vanilla kick in. The smooth palate focuses on coconut and more vanilla with kumquat and lime. Almonds and vanilla in the mildly spicy finish. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
4571,6,"A 2020 addition to the Fettercairn stable this expression was distilled using chocolate
malt and matured in first-fill bourbon casks before a finishing in sherry and port
casks. The nose is slightly meaty with raisins black treacle white pepper and dark
chocolate. Smooth on the substantial palate with drinking chocolate plums black
pepper cinnamon and a savory note. Ginger chile instant coffee and pipe tobacco
in the finish. £70"
4572,6,"This limited edition 16 year old release is named after a collie dog that belonged to a distillery manager pictured in a 1905 photograph of Glenturret staff. Malt and milk chocolate dried apricots and subtle spice on the floral nose with a hint of worn leather and ultimately ripe pears. Supple and rounded on the palate with sweet spices honey black pepper dark fruit and coffee notes. Finally bitter orange and plain chocolate in the medium-length finish. (1740 bottles) £95"
4573,6,"As the name implies this non-chill filtered expression was finished in Pedro Ximinez sherry butts. The nose offers sweet sherry honey malt and lemon while the palate yields more sherry plain chocolate honey spicy toffee and a hint of orange. More spicy toffee plus drying oak in the medium-length finish."
4576,9,"Quite fresh and lively for its age and loaded with fruit. You’ll find bright fruit (tangerine passion fruit lemon) followed by subtle sweeter fruit (coconut honeydew melon banana and apple crumb pie). Resinous minty oak notes and a hefty viscosity give the whisky some structure while floral notes (lavender rose petals) and gentle vanilla expose a softer side to the whisky. Dry oak finish."
4577,9,"The whisky is quite fruity (green grape orange tangerine and dark cherry) with balancing notes of vanilla roasted nuts and a hint of peat. Dry lightly spicy finish that lingers. It is complex and nicely balanced for a whisky of this age. Still I feel the 15 year old Fine Oak edition is better and at $65 one-tenth the cost."
4578,6,"A William Grant & Sons single malt from an undisclosed Lowland distillery. It offers flavors of mashed turnip sprinkled with table salt early on the nose; brittle toffee malt and vanilla aromas develop. Creamy toffee more salt honey orange fondant and sweet oak on the palate. The lengthy finish features gentle spices oak and white pepper. £22"
4579,6,"Heavily peated Bunnahabhain spirit referred to as Margadale was used for this bottling and matured in refill sherry butts. Savory on the nose with smoky brine plain chocolate and Granny Smith apples. The palate offers similar green apple notes along with sweet peat cocoa and licorice. Wood smoke and pipe tobacco in the medium-length finish."
4580,1,"Every month seems to bring a new Octomore. Much is made of the peatiness of the malt used but just as important is the way in which it is distilled and matured. It is these two aspects that give it sweetness and balance. This is minty honey-sweet with meadowsweet some dried lavender tinned peaches and that hot sand note typical of Bruichladdich. The smoke is merely suggestive giving an integrated power. 5 years old? Who knows what might happen next?"
4581,6,"Darkness! is a range of cask strength single malts which have been finished for 3 months in 50-liter first-fill oloroso or Pedro Ximénez casks. Waxy on the nose with dates prunes cherries cocoa powder window polish and finally vanilla. Warm and spicy on the palate with sweet sherry hot chocolate intense tropical fruit notes and cloves. The fruit becomes more citric in the finish; nutty with clove oil. £75"
4582,1,"Big smoke. Smoked fish in fact with some linked oily elegance along with touches of hot tar and a cooked agave quality adding a slightly sour/sweet element; then come poached pear and pepper. The palate is rootier but always with this deep clinging texture. As it moves it sweetens briefly then comes creosote. Water gives the sweetness more space before the big phenols come powering back. It’s a barbecue in your mouth. Classic Laphroaig in fact. £91"
4583,6,"Glenglassaugh initially imported Massandra wine casks from the Crimea in 2010 for finishing purposes and that was the first time the winery had allowed its wood to be exported. In 2014 two Massandra cask finishes were released. Distilled in 1978 the Madeira-finished nose yields dates sultanas stewed fruit caramel a hint of smoke and spices. Smooth on the palate with apricots cocoa powder oak and lots of spice development. The softly-oaked finish is lengthy citric and spicy. £395"
4584,9,"Pale gold/straw color. Fresh appetizing aroma and flavor of brine delicate peat gentle sweetness and a touch of spice and seaweed. Medium in body and slightly oily in texture. Nicely balanced and clean with a salty dryish finish. This is a lovely very appetizing expression of a distillery that has been closed and dismantled. (It was the original Clynelish distillery.) It is a very nice example of a northern Highland whisky and expresses a great balance between sweetness and brine youth and maturity. However I would have liked to have seen it bottled at a higher strength."
4585,6,"This expression was distilled during Arran’s second year of operation in September 1996 and bottled at 19 years of age. The single refill hogshead yielded 288 bottles. Sweet and malty on the slick nose with honey lively spices and hints of pine. Ultimately caramel and satsuma. Full on the palate with juicy fruit more malt and honey and developing milk chocolate. Long and soft in the finish; lightly spiced finally slightly citric with a hint of brine and dry oak. £80"
4586,6,"Initially matured in recharred puncheons then transferred for an unspecified period into virgin American oak casks. The nose offers icing sugar and soft toffee vanilla clementine and wood varnish. More icing sugar with orange and fudge on the palate plus wood spice and an herbal note. Fruity through the finish while spice builds with a hint of aniseed at the close. An interesting alternative to the classic sherry-rich GlenDronach style."
4587,6,"Like its elder sibling Loch Lomond 12 year old is presented in non-chill filtered form and in this case matured in a mix of bourbon refill and recharred casks. Ripe apricots vanilla and a suggestion of peat smoke on the nose.  The full palate offers oranges and pears plus developing spicy malt and mild peatiness. Long in the finish with spicy fruit notes. Drying with subtle tannins."
4588,6,"The maturation regime of this Clynelish involves first-fill American oak barrels rejuvenated and refill American oak hogsheads plus bodega and refill European oak butts. The minimum age in the assemblage is 15 years and 2946 bottles are available.  A complex perfumed nose with scorched grass developing vanilla fudge and freshly-peeled orange. Classic Clynelish waxiness on the palate with toffee more orange peach digestive biscuits cinnamon and developing pepper. The lengthy creamy finish features chocolate-coated orange candy and ginger."
4589,6,"Navigator honors Old Pulteney’s seafaring heritage and promotional links with matters marine. The expression carries no age statement is non-chill filtered and has been matured in a mixture of bourbon and sherry casks. The nose features vanilla sherry American cream soda ginger orange peel and cocoa powder. Complex. Mouth-tingling spices: ginger and nutmeg on the palate with more oranges and cocoa. Dries slowly slightly powdery with persistent citrus fruit and a hint of brine. Value Pick."
4590,6,"Following on from its limited edition 21 year old release Dalmore has introduced a 30 year old expression with 888 numbered bottles being available. Matured in a mix of Matusalem oloroso and Amoroso oloroso sherry butts sourced from the Gonzales Byass bodega. The nose is slightly meaty with coffee sherry and stewed apple. Supple on the palate with dark spicy orange black currant cordial and marzipan. Spicy tannins kick in during the very long fruity finally mouth-drying finish."
4591,9,"This whisky shows the true potential of Mortlach -- and at a youthful age too! Quite fragrant and very complex on the nose and palate. Chewy toffee with almonds vanilla fudge ripe barley and nougat with underlying pit fruits dried spice and a hint of leather on the finish. Very fulfilling."
4643,9,"Style: Highland single malt scotch Color: Gold Aroma: Quite fruity (especially apples). Hint of honey and caramel with subtle background oak. Prickling alcohol before the addition of water. Palate: Smooth and mouth-coating. Nicely balanced. Delicately honeyed fruit notes up from followed by oak and toffee becoming dry and spicy with pleasant lingering oak."
4592,1,"The darkness of the hue of this the second official release of a 40 year old from Balvenie gives an indication of how intense the relationship between cask and spirit has been over its long sequestration. It emerges brimming with dense aromas such as tamarind paste treacle and Black Forest gateau. Amazingly on the palate there’s a lift of vanilla-like sweetness before the heavier and drier elements close down on the finish. Incredibly limited; only 150 bottles produced. £2500"
4593,1,"The hue is deep amber and the nose is equally resonant and rich. This is Glenrothes in its most muscular guise so that while you have the normal layers of fruity complexity there is an extra weight. Think of citrus peels sticky dates walnuts and fruit leather. The palate is soft and rolling with light tannin. For me it’s at its best au naturel."
4594,6,"The latest addition to Glen Moray’s Classic range was aged in bourbon barrels and finished in cabernet sauvignon wine casks. Raspberry cordial is prominent on the nose with soft toffee marzipan and coconut. The raspberry carries over from the nose to the palate with vanilla ginger and ultimately dark chocolate. Spicy in the finish with berry fruits and  subtle oak. Best Value"
4595,1,"Unusual insofar as this is the one chance a year that drinkers get to try Caol Ila’s other expression: the unpeated version which — and here’s a bit of history for you — helped save the distillery during the lean period of the whisky loch in the early 80s. Rather than this just being Caol Ila with the peat stripped out the team made  it in a different fashion — but there are still hints of commonality. 
For example the grassy note that usually lies beneath the smoke is the lead aroma here and it’s not any old grass but wet grass — like skidding on a football (soccer) field. The mind keeps looking for smoke but apart from a hint of birch smoke (which could come from the (refill) cask) it’s whistle-clean and fruity and with a touch of water fills with an aroma of toffee popcorn custard and pears. 
The palate continues in this light fashion with melon balls and fruit cocktail. This potentially bland fleshiness is given a perkiness thanks to the high alcohol and again a jag of acidity. Bizarrely on the finish I pick up slight saltiness. A fun dram."
4596,6,"This 38 year old Travel Retail-exclusive expression has been aged in bourbon casks and not chill filtered. It follows an initial batch of the same vintage released in 2011. The nose is perfumed with a resin note and developing vanilla and caramel popcorn. Demerara sugar and oak. Very fruity on the palate with oranges and lemons emerging spices and benign oak. Long in the finish with fruity oak. The additional maturation has given the fruity elements a greater profundity. (500 bottles)"
4597,1,"Light gold with good intensity and a more noticeable malty note than is common with this distillery as well as touches of daffodil and dried honeycomb. The wood influence appears minimal to start with but more vanilla creeps through in time; water brings out almond milk. Opens into clementine peel pomelo then cooked dessert apple. The palate is clean and forward; even slightly hot when neat. Remarkably assertive for a 25 year old."
4598,1,"Pale gold. Lightly floral and perfumed. The impression of honey on warm buttered scones. As it opens so this gentle complexity grows and gives a sense of some substance. Water reveals a hint of malt fruit syrups and pear blossom. The palate is creamy and needs a drop of water to reveal the acid/sweet flavor of white currant and a hint of marzipan. A classic example of a light whisky—and a distillery—which could easily be overlooked. Don’t. £74"
4599,9,"Bright gold color. Fresh appetizing aroma of vanilla malt honey brine and subtle tropical fruit. Light to medium in body and slightly oily in texture. Delicious fresh subtly complex flavors of vanilla malt sea salt subtle tropical fruit and fresh herbs finishing dry and lightly spicy. Since the owners of Murray McDavid also control the Bruichladdich distillery one would expect a good bottling. This is a good one indeed and very exciting to drink. It is nicely matured fresh and deliciously appetizing-almost mouth-watering."
4600,9,"Pleasingly sweet and fruity with notes of caramel apples berries in honey vanilla and ripe pear. Fresh brine and subtle mint emerge occasionally and linger on the finish. Nicely balanced more complex with a wider range of flavors than the Old Pulteney 21 year old."
4601,1,"Deep ruby with a yellow rim. Clearly mature and heavily sherried. A highly concentrated nose: Marmite and soy sauce and all the fresh fruits of youth reduced to essence. Drinkwise it’s closest to Chinato: curative barks dried herbs (mint hyssop oregano). The palate is unsurprisingly thick and lightly smoky but the tannins aren't overly astringent and there remains a sweet core still even if the overall effect is dark. It’s not obviously Glen Grant but it is a fascinating glass."
4602,1,"A new NAS this has a thick silky nose in classic ‘Rothes style which reminds you of coffee cream icing hazelnut syrup semi-dried soft fruits and horchata. The palate has elegance and poise with a hint of menthol lifting off into pecan and light grippy oak. Has excellent length and mellow flow. Water slightly reduces its voluptuous charms so be careful (or simply avoid). Praise for revealing all the vintages used and the fantastic price. Chapeau! £39"
4603,9,"Aged in both refill and new bourbon casks. The new bourbon casks are evident and I think it adds richness vibrancy and perceived maturity (which I like) when compared to the previous Summer 2010 release. Very pale in color. Brooding with licorice root coal tar bacon fat damp peat bright fruit (citrus and pear) and intriguing botanicals all on a soothing bed of vanilla malt. Smoky briny finish. I’m still amazed how this very young whisky can taste so mature. Well done!"
4604,9,"Bright fruit throughout (red raspberry strawberry-rhubarb pie gooseberry red currant nectarine) honeyed malt dark chocolate tarry rope seaweed soaked in olive brine and ground pepper. Tarry finish. Nicely balanced well-defined flavors and fully mature at 10 years of age."
4605,9,"Bright gold color and bright in flavor. Very much in the Bladnoch style with honey-kissed lemon tangerine kiwi creamy vanilla lightly toasted marshmallow marzipan cut grass and hay. Richly textured for a Lowland and palate-coating (a tad oily too!). The extra years have added some depth while still retaining a youthful zest. Very enjoyable."
4606,6,"A limited edition of 12000 bottles this expression from Arran was initially matured in first-fill bourbon barrels before a secondary period of aging in American oak quarter casks which accelerated maturation. A big hit of tinned peaches then malt cinnamon vanilla and caramel. Sweet and rounded on the palate with lots of fresh fruit notably pineapple plus caramel chili and ginger. Relatively long in the fruity finish with brittle toffee new oak and persistent spice. £55"
4644,9,"Gold color. Aromas of toffee nuts and a hint of mint. Medium in body with a malty coating texture. The flavors evolve on the palate with toffee up front malty sweetness in the middle and nutty finishing pleasantly dry with a hint of mint and vanilla."
4607,1,"Full gold in color this Bunna initially has the lifted Moscatel aroma that’s reminiscent of a fine Darjeeling leaf tea then comes melting milk chocolate and touches of sweet cinnamon toast. The palate continues in this sweet vein but has the distillery’s characteristic thickness in the mid-palate as well as plenty of its signature fresh ginger note. With water there are some baked fruits and a hint of flowers. Altogether delicious and subtly complex."
4608,1,"The only Islay distillery not on the coast — and the most westerly on the island — Kilchoman is reviving the tradition of farm distilling and this limited edition release uses locally grown Optic barley malted at the distillery. Very creamy with some stewed apple green banana and (when diluted) sponge cake mix. The smoke develops on the palate adding an earthy note. Rich with some clove and licorice on the finish. Well worth a look."
4609,9,"Delicately floral (lavender rose) and perfumed with notes of chamomile hay soft vanilla and gentle malt. Creamy and soothing with a gently dry finish. Lots of depth for a lighter weight whisky. A lovely aperitif. I feel Rosebank is freshest and best when it is young. With the distillery closing in 1993 now’s the time to act and this is one of the better bottlings I’ve tasted."
4610,6,"The most expensive of Glen Scotia’s new trio has been finished in deeply-charred barrels and bottled non-chill filtered at cask strength. Soft and sweet on the nose with peaches fudge and a hint of oak. Full-bodied and slightly oily on the palate with wood spices vanilla and blackberries. Smoky ginger and lively char in the lengthy finish."
4611,6,"A replacement for the 10 year old Curiositas this was aged in a combination of bourbon Jamaican rum and toasted virgin oak casks. The early nose yields light peat smoke with hand-rolled tobacco then tropical fruit and cigarette ash. On the palate there’s stone fruit spices vanilla new leather smoldering peat and dark chocolate. The finish offers oak black pepper salt and earthy peat."
4612,6,"Matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. It offers a nose redolent of Christmas pudding: figs sultanas orange honey and cream. Smooth on the palate with sweet spicy sherry orchard fruits and caramel. Raisins and plain chocolate in the lingering finish with Jaffa orange notes to the end."
4613,6,"Introduced in 2004 Curiositas was the first peated expression to be marketed by BenRiach. It has been peated to 55ppm and matured in bourbon casks. Mildly medicinal earthy peat on the nose hot road tar honey and light tropical fruit aromas. Iodine and smoky peat on the palate with mineral notes dried fruits allspice and oak. More oak in the medium-length finish with peanut and peppery peat."
4614,6,"One of six whiskies released in Distell’s first Malt Collection. This received a secondary maturation of almost 2 years in Palo Cortado casks rarely used for Scotch whisky. Melon slices sprinkled with salt vanilla and finally peach blossom on the nose. More peaches on the spicy palate with milk chocolate and oak. Peppery in the medium-length finish with aniseed. (1644 bottles)"
4615,6,"The nose gives a whiff of vanilla fudge then black pepper sea salt and a savory note develops. The palate yields maritime-tinged candied fruits and effervescent smoke. Slightly tarry in the finish. Macho!"
4616,6,"‘Cairdeas’ is Gaelic for ‘friendship.’ This bottling was aged in first-fill bourbon casks before a finishing period in fino sherry casks. The nose offers lemon cheesecake smoked in peat with brine almonds and oysters. Full and rounded on the palate with stewed fruits ashy peat antiseptic and more brine. The lengthy finish features licorice tar rock salt phenols and citrus fruits."
4617,6,"Floral on the nose and quite delicate with citrus fruit spicy vanilla walnuts and cereal. The palate is smooth with malt orchard fruits toffee apples and graham crackers. An herbal note features early in the slowly drying finish."
4618,6,"The only survivor from Old Pulteney’s core range shake-up of 2018 this has been matured in first and second-fill bourbon casks. The nose is delicate with almonds honey and floral notes. Malt and toffee on the palate with spicy oak and a hint of brine. The medium-length finish is nutty with wood spices."
4619,6,"This NAS expression is part of the new 2018 Old Pulteney core lineup. Initially matured in second-fill American oak and bourbon casks it was finished in bourbon casks that previously held heavily peated whisky. Sweet woodsmoke crème brûlée green apples and cinder toffee on the nose. The smoke is more peat-induced on the palate with banana fritters and subtly sprinkled with sea salt. The finish features caramel and herbal notes."
4620,9,"Antique gold color. Mature aromas of creamy vanilla thick coconut oak and a hint of mint. The classic Springbank sea breeze aroma struggles for recognition. Medium body and oily in texture. Flavors deliver what the aroma promises with additional dry wood spices and a very long finish."
4621,6,"Refill sherry hogsheads have been used to mature the latest Gordon & MacPhail bottling of Clynelish the most northerly distillery in Diageo’s portfolio. Initially quite earthy on the nose with mustard seeds pepper and contrasting malt. Becoming progressively sweeter and less complex. Quite oily in texture the earthiness carries over from the nose onto the palate then sweet fruit notes malt and spice emerge plus a delicate thread of smoke. The finish dries slowly with a hint of peat."
4622,6,"The nose is muted with gentle orchard fruits subtle malt nougat and nutty toffee. The palate by contrast is bold and offers big fresh fruit notes notably zesty tangerines along with crème brûlée. Dry peat notes follow. Earthy peat smoke and white pepper with a citrus tang in the long finish. (230 bottles)"
4623,1,"Glenrothes always has a spicy element but this example ups the ante considerably and true to the label it’s fresh-cut ginger root alongside galangal and coriander a hint of green grass and even a little bite of jelly babies alongside black currant leaf. Rothes’ normally languid air is here frothily exuberant with just sufficient vanilla thickness to offer a brake. Uplifting and good. £107"
4624,9,"The Islay character is most evident in the younger whisky expressions before the oak has tamed them. This whisky is a perfect example: an uninhibited incredibly powerful Caol Ila thumping out notes of tarry rope damp peat kippers and seaweed. Background spices (salt pepper ginger) add intrigue while a firm foundation of vanilla malt struggles to provide soothing comfort. Extreme Islay whisky. (A Binny’s Beverage Depot exclusive.)"
4625,6,"This malt is actually 36 years old having spent its first 34 years in a refill hogshead before two years of maturation in a first fill ex-Sauternes cask. The out-turn was 280 bottles. Mellow on the nose with fresh oranges and apples developing toffee and violets. Smooth and fruity on the palate with dark chocolate pepper and discreet tannins. Long in the finish with fruity oak. £400"
4626,6,"Balblair has followed up the first release of its 1975 vintage bottling with a second which differs significantly in character having been matured in American oak sherry casks whereas the initial release had been aged in Spanish oak sherry casks. Floral mellow and slightly oily on the nose with a savory background and ready-salted crisps. Silky smooth on the palate with citrus fruit a hint of wood smoke coconut and honey. The finish is spicy with aniseed and oak."
4627,6,"Comprising 100 percent whisky matured in oloroso sherry casks the Tay Dram is fresh and vibrant on the nose with fruit and toffee. Fuller bodied than the Tweed or Dee Drams with more overt evidence of sherry followed through by honey almonds coffee and toffee. Dark chocolate is to the fore in the lengthy finish — this time closer to chocolate orange confectionery. £42 Currently not available in the U.S."
4628,6,"Having released four previous “work in progress” expressions of Kilkerran 2013 sees the launch of two editions one matured in sherry casks and the other in bourbon barrels. The sherry-aged variant yields overripe green grapes and figs on the nose followed by honey and plain chocolate while the palate is quite full softly fruity with soft toffee and a hint of brine. The finish dries significantly with cocoa powder licorice and lots of spice. £38"
4629,10,"The latest version of the first certified organic Scotch whisky is a creamy malt that has lashings of vanilla banana peel and pecan pie aromas. Smooth malty flavors abound. Banoffee pie topped with sliced banana apple nectarine and ripe peach with a good flare of peppery spices. Fuzzy earthy spice then an outro of sweet fudge. With water more green fruit melon tropical fruits and a little chili kick emerge."
4630,6,"This 1977 ‘house’ vintage expression has been matured for 32 years in oloroso sherry casks. Just 240 bottles have been produced. Delicate sweet and floral on the nose with old leather caramel vanilla and malt. The caramel deepens with time. The palate is initially sweet smooth and malty with pear drops; becoming nuttier with soft oak in the medium-length finish. £370 Currently not available in the U.S."
4631,6,"The latest incarnation of Springbank’s Longrow Red matured for 11 years in port casks before being bottled at cask strength. The nose is sweet with cherries caramel new leather chewing tobacco and soft peat. Voluptuous in the mouth with a palate of rich peat summer berries and toffee apples with growing spice notes and light oak. Lengthy in the finish with cinnamon peat sweet oak and red berries."
4632,1,"Sweet oak and cod liver oil are what greet you with fleshy lychee-like fruits
behind. The smoke here is very polite giving way to fruit jelly cubes and
peaches to develop alongside crisp apple. The palate is clean with nutty oak with
the smoke continuing in the background offering an extra layer of complexity.
Fresh belying its age while it has typical tongue-coating oiliness it remains
understated. Caol Ila basking in the summer sun. (U.S. only)"
4633,6,"Wemyss Malts has bottled this 23 year old hogshead-matured example of Glen Garioch from the Aberdeenshire village of Oldmeldrum. Just 322 bottles were yielded by the cask. Cigarette tobacco brittle toffee and a hint of aniseed on the nose. Vanilla develops along with strawberries apples and pears. Rich malt walnuts cooked apple and cinnamon on the palate. The spicy finish features old leather and pepper. £105"
4634,6,"The latest Wemyss single cask release of Clynelish from the distillery at Brora in Sutherland runs to 258 bottles and has been matured in a hogshead. Freshly-sliced green apples on the nose slightly peppery with grated nutmeg and salted caramels. Relatively full-bodied with lots of soft fruit principally Jaffa oranges and sweet spice. Spicy caramel and cocoa powder in the slowly drying medium-length finish. £75"
4635,9,"It’s good to see an official distillery bottling of Clynelish in the U.S. This one is very true to the Clynelish style: fresh appetizing and very drinkable. Notes of brine fruit (lemon-lime) and vanilla-accented malt are the foundation of this whisky. Delicate seaweed peat exotic pepper and a hint of citrus rind bitterness entertain the palate throughout all the way to its appetizingly briny seaweed-tinged finish. Perhaps the definitive aperitif whisky."
4636,1,"The combination of Linkwood and sherry cask can be to the detriment of such a perfumed whisky. Not here. The nose speaks of caramel toffee demerara sugar and while an oaky touch is there it’s light allowing plump sultanas rose and a delightful balsamic cider vinegar note to emerge. The palate is relaxed and gentle with darker fruits. There’s sufficient body to cope with the tannic squeeze. It needs water to reach ideal balance. Lovely. £65"
4637,6,"This veteran example of Tomatin was distilled in November 1967 and matured for 45 years in refill butt #9315. The outturn was
175 bottles. Uncompromising dark sherry and treacle notes on the fruity nose along with gunpowder tea. Big old sherry notes on the full palate with raisins sultanas and a sprinkling of black pepper. Fruity notably spicy and not too drying for its age in a relatively supple finish. £230"
4638,9,"Matured in port casks. The standard Cragganmore 12 year old is one of Scotland’s best kept secrets-I enjoy its incredibly complex dry spicy character. The port contributes ripe fruit flavors (cherries in syrup golden raisins mandarin glazed berries) which complements the dry spicy notes nicely and makes for a more balanced product. Still for this the whisky sacrifices some of its individuality and brilliancy with all that port. A fair trade-off though."
4639,9,"Deep amber/chestnut/crimson color suggesting a good dose of sherry cask aging which the palate confirms. Syrupy notes of fruitcake burnt fig raisin and beeswax are balanced by resinous oak polished leather roasted nuts and dried spice on the finish. The 37 years of oak impact is balanced nicely by the sherry even if both are a bit extreme for what is normally a more elegant dram."
4640,9,"Straw gold. Aromas of a sweet shop-vanilla honey marshmallow and confectioner’s sugar. Light to medium body and soft. Clean flavors which are very malty and honeyed with notes of marshmallow and vanilla. Gently sweet finish."
4641,6,"The nose is inviting with marzipan malt ripe bananas milk chocolate and cinnamon. Green fruit notes emerge later. Very sweet on the smooth palate with bubble gum satsumas peaches and delicate spice. The finish is medium to long and persistently sweet and fruity with a hint of dark chocolate at the end. Sure to satisfy a sweet tooth."
4642,6,"Named for Highland Park Distillery’s founder Magnus Eunson. It has been matured in first-fill and refill American oak sherry casks. The nose offers honeysuckle vanilla rising bread dough and faint aromatic wood smoke. Slightly smoky orchard fruits on the early palate with sultanas ripe cherries and cinnamon. Medium to long in the finish with drying fruit notes wood spice and ultimately licorice sticks. (U.S. exclusive)"
4646,9,"Matured in a sherry cask. Chock full of ripe fruit but still quite feminine in personality. Firm malt foundation almost buttery in texture with juicy oak maple syrup raspberry (red and black) strawberry and dates peppered with gentle spice (cinnamon ginger). While this is a very enjoyable whisky I have tasted some excellent Linkwood bottlings including the standard 12 year old from back in the early 1990s that brandished less sherry allowing more of Linkwood’s gentle nature to blossom. Still the sherry influence here is pristine and it gives as much as it masks. (430 bottles)£200"
4647,6,"An appropriately dark bottle and label are featured for the Night’s Watch bottling. Tangy citrus fruit brittle toffee and vanilla on the nose. Nicely textured in the mouth with tangerine segments in cream developing nuttiness milky coffee and a hint of char. Lively spices toffee and aniseed in the medium-length slightly oaky finish."
4648,9,"Matured in a “rejuvenated European oak” cask. Balance: that’s what I like best about this whisky. It’s not as individualistic or distinctive as the others but that’s how I always think of Glen Elgin so no surprise here. This is a solid effort: fruity and flowery with notes of tangerine marmalade caramel apple ginger cut grass cinnamon almond paste and underlying vanilla lingering in a satisfying finish. (534 bottles) £250"
4649,6,"House Baratheon is represented with a label depicting a crown-wearing rampant stag. An undemanding dram with soft toffee cream baked apples and a hint of ginger on the nose. The palate is light with brittle toffee soft fruit notes and oak. Drying in the finish through aniseed and wood spice."
4650,6,"This showcases House Tully’s leaping fish sigil. The nose yields honey barley sugar walnuts and plums. The palate is straightforward and approachable with green apples orange juice and delicate spice. The finish is medium in length with toffee and mildly spicy oak."
4651,9,"So nice to see this whisky available here in the U.S. again. A more mature more sherried expression of the standard Royal Lochnagar. Rich silky and sweet with molasses nutty toffee old demerara pot still rum caramelized fig marmalade and juicy oak. More subtle notes of honeyed ginger coffee grounds and tobacco leaf add complexity. A soothing post-prandial dram."
4652,9,"Although this distillery is operating it remains one of the hardest Speyside whiskies to find. This is unfortunate. A fairly straight-forward whisky-pleasingly malty and somewhat viscous on the palate with some grassy notes. The extra years with this particular bottling anyway have allowed the whisky to blossom become a little more intriguing and heavier. Along with malt and grassy notes I’m picking up citrus fruit (especially on the nose) toffee nuts freshly ground roasted cocoa beans nougat and vanilla fudge."
4653,6,"This vintage Benromach has been finished in Sassicaia wine casks from the Bolgheri wine region of Italy after maturation in first-fill bourbon barrels. Red currants and warm peat ginger and vanilla on the nose. Initially juicy fruit on the palate but soon drier than expected from the nose. Dark berry fruits and subtle smoke develop. Relatively long in the finish with gentle spices. Ultimately sweeter soft fruit notes return. (8000 bottles)"
4654,6,"This expression of Glen Grant has been matured in refill bourbon casks and is arguably more characterful than the distiller’s own variant of the same age. Ripe orchard fruits on the nose with honey and cinder toffee. The palate is light to medium in weight offering more fresh fruit notes vanilla milk chocolate and a hint of ginger. The nutty finish dries with just a hint of smoke."
4655,9,"Over the past decade there has been no shortage of Glendronach expressions. I know of at least one 15 year old an 18 year old a 19 year old a 1968 vintage and four different 12 year old versions. My favorite of the range was the limited edition 19 year old released here in the U.S. about a decade ago. The 1968 Vintage which you can still find on retailers’ shelves is also a worthy dram. But this new 12 year old “Original” expression is certainly my favorite of the 12s (and the 15). I feel that Glendronach expresses itself best when it is not dominated by the sherry allowing a greater balance of flavors. This whisky was originally matured in sherry casks but was then (fortunately) aged in bourbon casks for the remainder of its maturation. The result? A richly flavored nicely balanced whisky expressing notes of sherried fruit burnt caramel light toffee and nuts all underpinned by a soothing malty foundation. Yum!"
4656,9,"Complex dynamic and well-balanced. Honeyed vanilla bright fruit (lemon tangerine nectarine) sultana green grapes and banana bread peppered with ginger and subtle gripping grape skin. Great mouth-feel (from the oak) which adds another dimension. That’s what 46% and no chill-filtering will do for a whisky. One of the better Arran whiskies I’ve tasted. (Released in 2009. Sadly not available in the U.S.) £38"
4657,9,"A release chosen by Douglas Maclean (and named after his song “Caledonia”). Full sherry impact but contained—not excessive or sappy. Rich with nutty toffee pot still rum a variety of raisins (regular and golden) date honeyed fruit polished leather and a hint of tobacco. Good resinous grip on the finish to balance the sweetness. The flavors are nicely integrated."
4658,9,"Bright gold color. Big and firm on the palate. Quite fruity too (tangerine pear sultana pineapple) on a dry malty foundation. Lighter notes of grass hay linseed oil and dried vanilla add complexity. Dried fruit and malt finish. A really nice dram with gobs of character."
4659,9,"Very bright and lively with a nice balance of flavors. Zesty fruit (lemon peach ripe pineapple golden raisin) on a bed of layered sweetness (creamy vanilla light honey lightly toasted marshmallow and a hint of coconut). Gently dry delicately spicy dried citrus finish. Light enough and with enough zing to enjoy before dinner but it should stand up well enough after dinner too. This is a nice whisky but it shows a lighter more elegant side of Glenrothes. It doesn’t express the rich opulent notes often shown in bottlings like the 1972 Vintage for example."
4660,1,"This is a refill (or in 'Farclas terms ‘plain’) hogshead so there is less wood on show and more distillery. The nose is like a gentleman’s club at lunchtime: roasting meat some pipe tobacco polished wood and the scent of a freshly-dug garden wafting through the windows. The palate shows slightly more fresh fruitiness (in line with the 1971 cask). There’s decent grip; think treacle this time. Fluxes and changes which makes it all the more intriguing. £246"
4661,1,"A refill hogshead this time which when combined with its (relative) youth throws the distillery character into even greater focus. Positively light to start with a green edge to the dry grass seen in the 1970s and more of the fruity notes hinted at in the 1982. All the time though it is anchored by meaty earthiness and that distinctive burnt note. The finish is a little short but all in all a very appetizing example. £250"
4662,6,"Another expression from anCnoc’s first batch of Peaty Collection releases this has the lowest phenolic level of the trio at 11 ppm. Initial peatiness on the nose gives way to sliced pineapple nougat and spicy vanilla. Ripe apple milk chocolate and honey emerge out of soft peatiness on the palate. Old leather and a hint of spice in the medium-length finish."
4663,12,"Intensely fruity and floral on the nose like a rosebush-lined berry patch; there’s also shortcake with lemon drizzle almonds and orange peel. With water the fruit character deepens and takes on an edge of marzipan. The palate fizzes with citrus and soap flavors tempered by milk chocolate tobacco and bitter leather. Without water it’s intensely drying though with it the character turns cloying: Tread carefully. (134 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
4664,9,"A single cask of Ardmore aged in a first-fill bourbon cask and then finished in quarter casks. This one is more mature with more depth than the standard Ardmore Traditional Cask (which I rated 80 a few years back). Notes of toffee vanilla bean chocolate fudge licorice stick bourbon tar charcoal and a hint of burnt raisin. Very nice! (A Julio’s Liquors Exclusive.)"
4665,6,"Matured in bourbon casks for 10 years followed by 2 years of finishing in ruby port pipes from the quintas or wine estates of Portugal. Stewed fruits cloves and port-soaked oak on the nose which carry over to the sweet viscous palate along with milky coffee fruit spices and cereal. The overall effect of sticky sweetness lingers through the finish."
4666,1,"Surprisingly pale (you see the issue Macallan?) but long aging in refill casks helps eliminate the bluntness of oak and can produce aromas that have been reduced and then taken into an exotic realm; here manifested as quince paste and kumquat followed by crystallized and candied fruits. The palate is subtle and soft with light heat toasted chocolate white currant and then overwhelming cherry blossom. Exotic is the word. Bottled for China but may be given a wider release. £3000"
4667,9,"While younger Glengoyne whiskies are enjoyable but often fairly straight-forward in flavor the older expressions develop nicely in depth. Regardless of age there’s always a creamy maltiness as the foundation of the whisky. For this expression notes of honey cookie dough dry spice notes (vanilla cinnamon) and soft fruit (citrus apple) round out the palate. This whisky is clean polished and very drinkable. A new addition to the Glengoyne line and very welcome."
4668,9,"This is six year old 40 ppm phenol (very smoky) whisky distilled at Bruichladdich bottled at cask strength and enhanced in Madeira casks. A young whisky but mature enough to say that it’s not too young. The immediate impact is damp peat smoke and smoldering charcoal. If you are patient and observant enough (and with an addition of water) you’ll coax notes of vanilla berried fruit pear green apple and underlying spice (fresh mint anise) all leading to a briny smoldering smoke finish. A cult whisky for those who like to push the envelope. When compared to its predecessor PC5 PC6 is slightly darker in color creamier fruitier and a shade softer. Given this I still prefer the PC5 over the PC6 for its clarity and innocence."
4669,1,"Startlingly herbal. Penetrating lifted and aromatic with dill mint and in time celery leaf and lovage. Smoke is akin to freshly-laid tarmac with some sweet seaweed behind. Lively and quite different to the official bottling. Water brings unripe pineapple clove sugared almond and horseradish. This has typical Kilchoman sweet creaminess in the center. Water brings out flavors of nettles and saltiness. £69"
4670,6,"This expression from Scapa in Orkney was distilled in 2001 and matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. Tropical fruit and butterscotch on the sweet light nose with very slight smokiness on the early palate along with spicy milky cocoa hazelnuts and more tropical fruit. The finish is medium in length with a hint of char. An easy-drinking nicely balanced dram at a good price."
4671,6,"This no age statement Talisker is one of the first “triple matured” (so-named) whiskies exclusive to Friends of The Classic Malts. Successive periods of aging occurred in refill casks charred American oak hogsheads and European oak refill casks. Ozone fresh asphalt dried fruits and old leather on the nose. A big pepper hit in the mouth backed by earthy peat Elastoplast vanilla and citrus fruits. The pepper lasts right to the end in the long steadily-drying charcoal-fueled finish. £80"
4672,6,"Along with Auchroisk Mannochmore is one of Diageo’s well-kept secrets. This 1990 distillate was matured in first-fill American oak hogsheads and European oak butts. Oily orange notes on the nose plus vanilla brittle toffee and honey. The palate is substantial rich and sweet with figs sultanas banana and more honey plus developing cloves. Raisins and plain chocolate in the long spicy finish. Diageo Special Releases 2016 bottling. (3954 bottles)"
4673,6,"Samsara’s (reviewed winter 2016) younger sibling Adela presents an altogether different profile having been matured in oloroso casks. Like Samsara it has not been chill filtered. The nose is nutty with quite dry sherry notes and prickly spice. Finally fragrant toffee emerges. Very supple in the mouth where the sherry becomes sweeter along with black currants licorice and then black pepper. The finish is medium in length dry and peppery."
4674,6,"This offers an enticing nose of honey malt and barley sugar—sweet and floral. Peaches in cream on the palate a suggestion of madeira milk chocolate and Brazil nuts. Cocoa citrus fruits and light oak in the medium-length finish. Value pick"
4675,1,"This oft-overlooked Speysider has been frustratingly variable in the past but now seems to have hit greater consistency. Worm tubs and weird stills combine to give a complex malt but one that needs help from oak to blossom fully. There are hedgerow aromas: black currant leaf hawthorn berries and lots of honey. A chestnut note continues on the tongue where on the finish a hint of smoke lurks."
4676,1,"People tend to moan about Macallan having lost its mojo. Not here. This is a vatting of different sized American and (mostly) European oak casks so no surprise that it’s oak-led but Macallan is a heavy distillate and it needs oak to prosper fully. Here you get rosin marmalade green fig jam and the power of concentrated oils. The palate is powerful and supple with some clove ginger and yet more chocolate. Substantial and well worth checking out."
4677,1,"Equally honeyed; in fact here the finish (oloroso this time) seems to enhance the sweetness. Out comes Manuka honey Greek yogurt and heavy blossom notes while the sherry itself brings in a nutty polished note. There’s just a hint of sulfur when you add water (Dalwhinnie is a sulfury new make). The finish is long with some Brazil nut. Try frozen with dessert."
4678,6,"Gordon & MacPhail’s latest bottling from Macduff distillery is a year 2000 distillation matured in refill sherry hogsheads. American cream soda and light spices on the nose with honey and white pepper development. Ultimately rum and raisin fudge. Smooth and supple in the mouth with apple peel soft fino sherry and nutmeg. The finish is medium in length with spicy fruit notes. £45"
4679,1,"The nose is sweet (think barley sugar/boiled sweets) with little bits of wheat chaff flying around in the background with dried flower petals and drying cut grass. Opens dramatically with water into almond milk/horchata and flowers. The palate is sweet and lifted with those gentle florals to the fore. Instead of Tormore’s normal nagging rigidity this flows sweetly over the tongue leaving fruit leather stewed rhubarb and with water rosewater and fresh wild strawberry. A lovely Tormore! £118"
4680,1,"Fruits are to the fore here super ripe and dark in hue: think of plump plums sweet black grapes and hedgerow berries. That said it is never heavy as if it’s just the aromatics of the fruits which have been preserved. In time some dried flowers emerge. The palate is equally sweet with a little caramel and spice. It fades gently. Impressive and well worth a look. I wonder whether the new Dalmunach distillery will produce anything like this? £213"
4681,6,"Tlàth is Gaelic for “mellow” or “gentle.” Rich malt caramel and milk chocolate on the initial nose with developing ginger honey and red apples. Fresh and approachable on the palate with more chocolate and ginger plus aniseed wood spices and light pepperiness. The finish is medium in length with milky coffee more aniseed and citrus fruits."
4682,1,"Maybe not as massive as its higher-strength brother (see above) but don’t think that this is light. There’s immediate grumbling peatiness mixed with dark chocolate lanolin and tamarind while the spiciness brings to mind tandoori food. There’s still the seaweed element while the lower strength pulls things into a darker core—coal tar soap damp moss. A very oily palate that with water takes you onto the peat bog. Seashells on a fire and more smoke round things off."
4683,6,"This expression from the Campbeltown distillery of Springbank was distilled in April 2000 matured for six years in refill bourbon barrels and then for another six years in Calvados casks. The outturn was 9420 bottles. Toffee apples dipped in soft spices on the nose with a follow through of vanilla. Quite viscous on the palate with white wine red peppers and cinnamon along with a tang of peat. Lime marmalade and a touch more peat in the relatively dry finish."
4684,6,"This bottling replaces the 15 year old Tawny Port Wood Finish. After first maturating in bourbon barrels finishing took place in tawny port casks. The nose offers vanilla and milky coffee with peppery red berries and a hint of plain chocolate. Vanilla toffee orange and spicy oak on the palate while the finish is long and warming with more spicy oak. £110"
4685,6,"Following on from the earlier 8 year old expression of this triple distilled Campbeltown malt the 12 year old first appeared in August 2009 and nicely illustrates the developments brought about by its continuing maturation. Rich on the nose with a clear sherry influence along with toffee marzipan apricots and milk chocolate. This is a substantial and well integrated dram with malt almonds cocoa and spice on the palate while the long spicy finish offers more chocolate soft fruits and coffee."
4686,6,"One of two initial releases in Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series this is a non-chill filtered expression. A vatting of twenty casks including first-fill bourbon sherry butts and port pipes. The nose is fragrant and faintly oriental with vanilla Jaffa oranges and apricots. The palate is full and sweet with oranges and lemons fudge plump sultanas milk chocolate and tangy spices. Drying steadily to fruity oakiness in the relatively lengthy finish. £50"
4687,1,"The latest bottling of “Breath” is like a whisky smuggler’s tale. There’s the smell of old waxed walking boots wet moss damp earth crushed bog foliage — heather bog myrtle — burlap sacking and a hastily smothered fire. The smoke is well controlled all the way which helps to allow its scents to run over bitter coffee and a balancing central sweetness. Robust hairy and uncompromising this is less of a breath and more of a roar. £65"
4688,6,"The latest While We Wait bottling comprises a mix of peated and unpeated whisky from an undisclosed distillery finished in French oak Tuscan wine casks. Fragrant on the nose with freshly mown hay gentle smoke berries honey and hot chocolate. Apricots and red wine on the palate with vanilla and dried fruits against a backdrop of singed woodsmoke. Nutty and oaky in the slightly oily finish. (10000 bottles)"
4689,1,"Here’s an Islay distillery which has never quite had the investment it deserves. Hopefully this limited release is the start of an addressing of that situation. It has a classic nose with ginger (crystallized) to the fore alongside toasted almond and the balsamic note that you sometimes get with extra-mature whiskies manifested here as mulberry vinegar. The mouth has coconut some grip and — though it fades a little speedily — retained fire. Take with water on the side. £1999"
4690,9,"A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice I would love to see several single cask cask strength and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

Citrus exotic wood and botanicals on the nose and palate. Indeed there’s a bit of intrigue here. Nice balance with roasted nuts pecan pie and more exotic wood on the finish."
4691,6,"This unspecified single malt has been bottled non-chill filtered in single cask format. Maturation took place in a barrel that formerly contained Islay single malt. Initially earthy on the nose with potato skins salt and white pepper. Time in the glass teases out fruity caramel sweetness. The palate is very sweet and zesty with orange sherbet along with a nicely integrated maritime note which becomes more pronounced. The finish is spicy and mildly medicinal. £50"
4692,6,"Launched in December 2015 the first release of Balblair’s Vintage 2005 replaces the previous 2003 expression. This is the youngest bottling in the brand’s portfolio. It was matured in bourbon barrels and is non-chill filtered. The nose is relatively light and fruity: vanilla ripe bananas honey a wisp of smoke and soft spices.  Toffee malt vanilla a biscuit-like note more bananas and new leather on the palate closing with a lengthy spicy finish."
4693,6,"The 2015 Work in Progress releases are the last before the single malt becomes a permanently-available 12 year old in 2016. 6000 bottles are available. Creamy malt marzipan and vanilla on the nose with pears instant coffee linseed and a hint of table salt. Soft and slightly oily on the warm spicy palate with immediate ripe apples caramel and slight smokiness. Long and slowly drying with a touch of aniseed and brine."
4694,6,"This Glenturret was bottled in Douglas Laing’s Old Particular series at 28 years old. After maturation in a single refill hogshead it was released in early 2016. Malt milk chocolate and honey on the pleasing mature rounded nose. Figs and sultanas develop in time. Smooth and rich on the palate with more malt cocoa powder and soft spices. Very long in the finish with quite insistent spice citrus fruit cloves and sweet oak. (168 bottles) £105"
4695,1,"Golden lifted and aromatic. The fleshy ripeness of the 13 year old is still there but that little sulfur edge has now gone revealing the ripe fruits massing underneath. Now you find pineapple and light chalk. The flowers have become daffodils and bluebells rather than lily along with a soft vanilla ice cream plumpness. Sweet and full and just a shade lighter than the 13 year old. Muscly but sweet; that’s the paradox of the Craigellachie character. £83"
4696,6,"Released in Wemyss Malts’ Cask Strength Single Cask Releases range. This expression of Clynelish was aged in a refill hogshead. Initially big coffee and ginger notes on the nose. Sweet orchard fruits develop in time along with a pinch of table salt. Very sweet and spicy on the palate with icing sugar and soft toffee. Salt white pepper and light oak in a long spicy finish. (274 bottles) £100"
4697,9,"Deep gold color. A very delightful aroma that defies its age with notes of rich creamy vanilla exotic tropical fruit honey and toasted oak. Rich mouth coating texture and body. Its flavor starts out like its aroma-creamy vanilla tropical fruit honey-then turns dry and becomes very dry leathery and oaky on the finish. Soothing long dry finish."
4698,6,"Coal smoke brine machine oil and herbal notes on the nose of this 50 year old along with a hint of menthol and ultimately floral notes. Dark berries on the palate bitter orange plus sea salt. The finish is long and slightly smoky overtly oaky with black pepper notes. (50 bottles in U.S.)"
4699,9,"I enjoy Glenlivet whisky for its subtle elegance floral notes along with a delicious ""peaches & cream"" flavor. For this particular whisky finishing some of the whisky in new French oak barrels adds depth dried spice (vanilla clove) and pleasing dryness to the Glenlivet profile. This whisky is more polished and refined than the 12 year old expression it replaces."
4700,1,"Full gold. Big robust and sweetly fragrant with honeysuckle stewing elderflower. There’s some oak but it’s not dominant. The palate starts creamy then there’s some caramel toffee with good distillery character. It melds freshness with the extra weight gained by gentle maturation. There’s coconut and cassia on the end. You lose the sweetness with water but you get more blossom and oak. Personally I’d go for it neat and sip slowly as a perfect summer dram. £130"
4701,6,"This is the youngest Sherry Oak expression available. A classic Macallan nose of sherry baking Christmas cake dried fruits hot butter and old leather. Jaffa oranges brittle toffee and light oak on the smooth full palate. Relatively long in the finish with spice malt oak and a final hint of smoke."
4702,6,"Scotland’s northernmost mainland distillery located in the historic port of Wick is owned by Inver House. The ‘entry level’ 12 year old expression is widely available. The nose presents pleasingly fresh malt and floral notes with a touch of pine. The palate offers a fuller bodied sweeter whisky than the nose might lead one to expect with more malt spices fresh fruit and a suggestion of salt. The finish is medium in length drying and decidedly nutty."
4703,6,"This U.S.-exclusive Premium Bourbon Single cask #2096 contrasts nicely with its sherry cask-matured sibling and offers vanilla cocoa powder malt extract ripe bananas and spicy sultanas on the nose. The palate is smooth and spicy with ginger snaps and developing butteriness. The finish is medium to long with chili notes and citrus fruits at the last."
4704,7,"BenRiach releases of this age are often peated or in a special barrel; here we have an unpeated non-barrel finish release. The nose is inviting with Honeycrisp apple toffee malt and a touch of oak. A very flavorful entry presents lush toffee apple malt and ginger. The spice increases in the mid-palate as well as the heat but we don’t get much added complexity. A long flavorful and slightly dry finish round out a very tasty but ultimately simplistic whisky. (U.S. only)"
4705,1,"It’s only right that the first single malt scotch given a period of time (3 years in this case) in Japanese oak (mizunara) casks is from Beam Suntory-owned Bowmore. It’s a fascinating mix of the vanilla spice and incense notes of mizunara and Bowmore’s distillery characteristics. You get rich peat black pepper apricot and peach all playing alongside each other. The palate is clean and lighter than the nose suggests with a fresh zestiness before the smoke leans back in."
4706,6,"The fourth release in Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series this expression comprises peated and unpeated single malt matured in bourbon barrels and then finished for 3 months in Latin American rum casks. A nose of spiced rum vanilla ripe pears and pipe tobacco. Baked apple sweet oak and cinder toffee on the palate with ashy smoke. Peppery sweet peat rum and brittle toffee in the relatively short finish. Best Value"
4707,9,"Glen Scotia has always been the bridesmaid to Springbank. This is justifiable considering that both production and availability of quality bottlings have been sporadic over the past decade or so. I like this one. It really shows the simple coastal pleasantness of this Campbeltown distillery. Ripe malty notes are accompanied by brine cut hay banana cream pie and honeyed vanilla. Lingering salty malty finish. With all the sherried and wine-finished Springbanks recently on the market (not that there’s anything wrong with that) here’s a nice no-frills Campbeltown whisky."
4708,6,"Edradour in Perthshire is owned by independent bottler Signatory who has released a wide variety of expressions during the past few years. However the standard 12 year old remains a classic of its kind.  Cider apples malt almonds vanilla and honey on the nose along with a hint of smoke and sherry. The palate is creamy and malty with a persistent nuttiness and quite pronounced sherry plus a touch of leather. Spices and sherry dominate the medium to long finish."
4709,6,"The ancient variety of barley known as bere that was used to make this Arran single malt was grown on Orkney and distilled in 2004. It was matured for eight years in bourbon barrels and 5800 bottles have been released. Very fruity on the nose principally peaches with vanilla and fudge something slightly herbal wet grass and finally homemade lemonade. Oily mouthfeel with fresh oak cloves and wild berries. An atypical Arran! The finish is drying and moreish. £48"
4710,6,"The latest releases from Glengoyne distillery are 10 year olds one matured in sherry wood and one in bourbon barrels as was the case with release 5. 9000 bottles are available globally. Initially savory on the nose slightly earthy with sherry new leather lemonade and a hint of ozone. Spicy and zesty with developing stewed fruits dark chocolate and deep sherry notes on the palate. The finish is long and persistently spicy mildly smoky with quite dry sherry notes."
4711,6,"A mix of 80% peated and 20% unpeated malt. Charcuterie cinnamon vanilla and caramel on the nose. Vanilla honey ginger and subtle peat smoke on the citric palate. Spicy peat and cereal notes in the medium-length finish. Best Values"
4712,6,"This was aged in a combination of bourbon and double-fired American oak barrels. Pears on the initially light nose then malty with soft spices figs and diluted orange juice. Quite full on the palate showing more pears vanilla caramel honey and barley sugar. The finish is peppery with lemon dark chocolate and black tea."
4713,6,"A comparatively rare independent bottling of what is in any case a hard to find single malt. Distilled in 1990 matured in an American oak hogshead (#646) and bottled at cask strength. White pepper damp earth violets cinnamon and slight saltiness on the nose. The pepper blackens on the idiosyncratic palate with cough syrup big spice notes and dark berries. Long and peppery in the finish with developing oak tannins."
4714,1,"Each independent bottler has its own signature style. Adelphi’s is about relaxed contemplative drams with rich maturity and a certain seriousness. Here you see this plus crème brûlée sitting in front of a sandalwood backdrop with a bunch of basil mint thrown in. The opening is slow and while the inherent sweet nature of the distillery is there hazelnuttish oak helps to add structure and stops any flabbiness from intruding. A luscious dram. £99"
4715,1,"One of a trio of new whiskies that have spent time in Glenfiddich’s new solera vats this will surprise many because of its overt smokiness that’s like a bonfire in a pear orchard. Some ferny greenness adds to the freshness. The reverse happens on the palate with the smoke being held in check by the soft mouthfeel (which could be solera-enhanced) ripe fruits and gentle creaminess. (Travel Retail; Asia only currently.)£70"
4716,6,"ICE Edition is a 17 year old matured predominantly in bourbon casks. Just 30000 rather extravagantly presented bottles are available globally.  Fresh and fruity on the nose with light trademark Highland Park sweet smoke ginger and a hint of dry earth. In time the fruits become more clearly defined as pears and peaches. Full and viscous on the palate; vanilla pepper brief orchard fruits then dry peat licorice aniseed and a lingering relatively dry finish."
4717,9,"Style: Highland single malt scotch Color: Gold Aroma: Subtly complex and somewhat dry with notes of vanilla almonds hay freshly cut grass and a hint of smoke. Palate: Clean and malty up front becoming dry as it begins to reveal its age as the maltiness turns into a potpourri of spice and dried fruit. Dry on the finish and spicy-almost peppery. Its finish is big and long for a Glenmorangie whisky."
4718,6,"The latest triple distilled bottling from the Lowland distillery of Auchentoshan has been matured for 35 years in bourbon casks and is presented non-chill filtered and at cask strength. Just 500 bottles are available globally. Apple crumble and custard on the nose with developing cereal notes. Smooth and enticing. Spice fresh fruits honey and marzipan on the buttery palate which ultimately becomes drier. The finish is long and discreetly drying with spices malted barley and a citrus tang in the tail. Price is approximate."
4719,6,"Distilled in 1997 and bottled in 2014 this expression of Dalwhinnie spent a period finishing in oloroso sherry casks. The nose offers honey ripe oranges peach blossom and creamy milk chocolate with just a wisp of smoke. Full-bodied and sweet on the palate with orange zest walnuts more honey and fruit spices. The finish is long and warming with a hint of peat and spicy oak."
4720,6,"This batch of GlenDronach’s popular cask strength has been aged in a combination of oloroso and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks. Malt honey rose blossom and chocolate-coated Turkish Delight plus emerging vanilla on the nose. The palate is full and rounded very sweet with more milk chocolate and very gentle spice. The finish is lengthy with milky coffee sweet spices and subtle oak."
4721,1,"Last year’s was a top-notch defiantly sherried example of Bowmore. This year’s batch thrusts equally boldly but starts in a more Japanese-accented fashion: think soy miso paste and salmon teriyaki. Light leather with hickory campfire smoke coming through strongly. The big oily tarry palate is like a spent barbecue with a hint of skidding car tires on Bowmore High Street. So still a belter but why so limited? Beam Suntory please sort it out! (6000 bottles) £60"
4722,6,"Ladyburn malt distillery was part of William Grant’s Girvan grain distilling complex in Ayrshire from 1966 to 1975. It was located close to where Ailsa Bay now stands. This veteran bottling is mature and rounded on a nose of sweet pears nectarines subtle vanilla and a hint of old hemp. Fresh fruit and lively spice on the early palate with worn leather and malt.  The fruit lingers through the very long finish with oak licorice and slightly bitter citrus notes."
4723,1,"The now-annual unpeated release shows its high strength on the nose but under the burn is a clean mineral and slightly lean Caol Ila with just a tiny whiff of smoke. A mix of grassiness/herbal notes with delicate white fruits that plump out into tinned fruit salad gooseberry and fresh pineapple. The palate is sweet and cake-like while the heat enhances its salty tang. Delightful sweet and long. (10668 bottles)"
4724,6,"The latest limited release in the Icons of Arran series was distilled in 1999 and matured in fourteen ex-bourbon barrels and seven sherry hogsheads. Initially launched in the UK but global availability is anticipated. A sprinkling of coconut vanilla and spices with pears melons and pineapple on the nose. Full and fruity on the palate becoming maltier and nuttier. Sweet spices especially stem ginger and a hint of honey. Drying slowly in the very spicy finish (6000 bottles). £42"
4725,7,"An Islay single malt of unknown origin aged in a bourbon barrel showcases many of the classic notes of a peated malt of this age with smoke iodine paste and oak. On the palate the smoky peat unfolds nicely as it’s exquisitely balanced by honey salt and caramel. The smoke intensifies in the mid-palate but never loses its balance with the sweeter undertones. A dry long smoky finish caps off a well-integrated and very enjoyable mystery malt. (U.S. only)"
4726,6,"Whiskies in Douglas Laing’s new Old Particular range are non-chill filtered and bottled at three strengths with those aged 19 years and over being offered at 51.5%. This Glen Scotia was distilled in May 1992 and boasts a nose of violets musky malt soft smoke and a fresh sea breeze. Big spicy and quite oily on the palate with dark berries black tea and a note of tar. Long and dark in the finish with oak tannins and persistent licorice. £85"
4727,9,"Fuller in body deeper and more complex than the 12 year old (as would be expected). Sweeter fruits (honey-laced citrus lemon gum drops and ripe peach) and rum notes marry nicely with dried spice (cinnamon vanilla ginger). Calming finish. An intelligent use of sherry cask aging."
4728,6,"This follows the first limited release of the 2002 vintage Peat Week. Like its predecessor this was distilled during the distillery’s annual week of peated production. Significantly peatier on the nose than the 2002 with Islay-like phenols backed by sweet floral notes. Sweet smoke vanilla citrus fruits and honey on the bold palate while the finish features more vanilla and honey plus spicy bonfire smoke."
4729,6,"After 14 years in bourbon wood this was finished in heavily-charred new American oak barrels sourced from Kelvin Cooperage in Louisville Kentucky. Malt vanilla and fudge on the nose with ripe apples and lively oak. Toffee caramel vanilla and cinnamon on the palate while the finish is nutty with notes of char. The closest Glenfiddich gets to producing a bourbon! Value pick"
4730,6,"Matured primarily in bourbon barrels for 12 years before a 3-month finish in slow-toasted virgin American oak barrels from Kelvin Cooperage in Kentucky. Honey vanilla cloves dried fruit and lively oak on the nose. The palate features citrus fruit and more cloves with milk chocolate honey walnuts and lots of wood spice. Raisins and black tea in the medium-length finish. (30000 bottles)"
4731,9,"Amber gold color. Rich honeyed malt in aroma. Quite floral with subtle notes of dried fruit. Full rich body. Very malty flavors with notes of honeyed fruit up front turning dry on the finish with notes of oak vanilla and dried fruit."
4732,9,"Bold and spicy but with enough backbone to handle it. Surely the most intense of the bunch overall. (The 25 year old is dry on the palate -- especially on the finish -- but the 30 year old challenges you the throughout.) There’s plenty of oak here imparting leather resin and dried spice notes (cinnamon clove vanilla) but it is rescued by sherried fruit honeyed citrus and toffee. A powerful dram."
4733,1,"Smoky yes but the effect is more shore-like: on the beach hot sand wood smoke and a faint hint of balloons…there must be a party going on. In addition you get olive oil preserved lemon and eucalyptus. The palate is thick with strawberry sweeties that push back against the peat. Water calms things (suggesting this would work with soda) while the finish sees the campfire emit more smoke. £45"
4734,1,"With no great wood on show this is a Caol Ila which is time—not oak—driven. A very scented nay herbal start like bouquet garni with light smoke grapefruit sea-washed stones ozone and heather blossom. The retention of aromatics is gorgeous. Water increases the peat effect but diminishes the aromatics so take your choice. Well worth a look."
4735,6,"As part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its Scotch whisky distilleries Bacardi subsidiary John Dewar & Sons has now released a trio of bottlings from Royal Brackla situated near Nairn in the Scottish Highlands. The 12 16 and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets Including the UK U.S. and Canada.
More restrained on the nose than the 12 and 16 year old variants with green apples melons and damp grass. The palate is silky and refined with fresh fruits just a hint of sherry light spice and a wisp of smoke. Aniseed and drying old oak in the earthy lengthy finish."
4736,1,"Here you have the sweetness of rising bread alongside scallop and wreathes of smoke all lit by west coast sunshine; the peat isn’t dank but bright and flaming. The palate is sweetly seductive before the smoke begins to come through then it sweetens like golden syrup then the shore comes back and so it continues. Water ups the impact of each so be careful as it can then seem disconnected. Sweet beachy smoky. Very Islay."
4737,9,"The fresher of the two with appetizing brine honey lemon rock candy golden raisin and peach. Subtle ginger toasted marshmallow and coconut round out the palate. Very bright and lively."
4738,6,"This expression from Aberfeldy was distilled in April 1995 and bottled in January 2014 after maturation in refill remade sherry hogsheads (casks #2488 2489 and 2491). The nose is floral with ginger and developing milk chocolate. Progressively sweeter with slight sherry and vanilla notes. The palate is silky and sweet with banoffee pie peaches and spicy oak. The finish is long with cocoa powder and more spiced oak. £60"
4739,6,"Balblair Vintage 2003 replaces the previous 2002 expression matured in second-fill bourbon barrels with the contents of eighteen making up this first release. Tinned peaches and apricot jam on the nose with underlying honey and caramel. Early malt then zesty lemon notes on the palate which also features freshly-cut grass and hazelnuts. The medium-length finish yields white pepper and cocoa powder."
4740,6,"Full Volume is a U.S.-exclusive bottling that was distilled in 1999 and matured entirely in first-fill bourbon casks. The nose is fragrant with canned pears and vanilla ice cream coconut and a very subtle wisp of smoke. Quite thin on the palate nutty mildly herbal with tropical fruits. Ashy peat smoke cocoa powder and wood spice in the medium-length finish."
4741,6,"Light berry fruit notes with resin walnuts and icing sugar on the nose. More confident berry notes on the palate with a hint of cloves then developing licorice dark chocolate and tangerine. The finish is spicy with aniseed."
4742,6,"The first house release of Tamnavulin since the 1990s. Sherry hazelnuts ginger cinnamon and milk chocolate on the nose. Medium-bodied with sweet sherry damsons light spice and toffee on the palate. Fruity oak in the finish."
4743,9,"The only sherry cask-aged Rarest of the Rare whisky reviewed here. Rich thick cut marmalade combined with chewy toffee sultana and nuts. The oak adds spice balance and complexity. This isn’t a one-trick (sherry) pony. There’s a lot going on here. Spicy resinous finish. One of the best Glenugies I have tasted."
4744,12,"An array of tropical fruit aromas—guava papaya green banana—mingle with incense fresh herbs and homemade cranberry sauce. The palate is light silky and flavorful: strawberry pineapple grapefruit soda and milk chocolate with a brief cigar-wrapper finish. A higher proof would go a long way to turn this whisky from merely pleasant to excellent. (Total Wine & More)"
4745,12,"Classic sherry aromas of raisins hazelnuts dark chocolate and cooked plums prime the palate but pay attention: a hint of peat is there presenting beautifully as smoke and saline along with sweet almond gingerbread chocolate-covered raisins and hazelnuts. The finish is wispy with oak cigar and dark chocolate flavors. (Total Wine & More)"
4746,6,"Dates brittle toffee dried fruits and old leather on the nose then a hint of ripe peaches surfaces. Smooth in the mouth with sherry damsons more dried fruits and background pipe tobacco smoke. Prune juice in the finish which is drying and ultimately quite oaky with white pepper."
4747,12,"An Easter basket of aromas and flavors. Delicately floral on the nose with rose petals hibiscus fresh-squeezed orange juice and a hint of pastry shop. Similar characteristics show on the palate where sweetness stops short of saccharine: orange cream candies bubble gum and cherry soda lead into a short finish with a jelly-bean sweetness. (Total Wine & More)"
4748,12,"Saline and earthy on the nose lifted up by green apple Juicy Fruit gum and mango. A pleasant smokiness—more cigar wrapper than peat—wafts through the palate’s juicy roundness of mango green apple and Red Vines. More tobacco leaf and toasted oak on the finish. (Trader Joe’s)"
4749,6,"Independent releases of the Perthshire single malt Aberfeldy are relatively rare and the first batch of That Boutique-y Whisky Company’s no age statement Aberfeldy runs to 155 numbered bottles. The nose features coconut ice vanilla malt candied peel and ginger. Good mouthfeel with more malt ginger-nut biscuits icing sugar and milk chocolate. The finish is drying with oak and black pepper. £65/500 ml"
4750,12,"Mineral and saline peat and brine along with a slight rubberiness are balanced by white pepper orange marmalade lemon herbs and grilled apples on the nose. The drying and smoky palate is light-bodied but with generous peat lemon and herb flavors finishing with oak smoke and more lemon. If you’re looking for a peated single malt that’s more gentle in body try this one. (Trader Joe’s)"
4751,12,"Earthiness and aromas of toffee apple stewed fruit ginger allspice walnuts and dried figs sweep into a sweet raisiny palate that also has flavors of candied nuts semi-dark chocolate dried fruit caramel and apples. Sweet with almonds and chocolate on the finish—lots of tasty sherry flavors here but an uncomplicated character. (Trader Joe’s)"
4752,6,"Ripe peaches vanilla sweet oak and milky coffee on the nose. The palate is luscious and smooth with sweet orange notes and cinnamon. The finish is medium in length with spicy berry fruits oak and lingering ginger."
4753,9,"A prime component in Dewar’s blended scotch. The finer bottles of Aberfeldy are quite flavorful yet still maintain a degree of elegance and finesse. This bottling is an excellent example of this. Its dominant flavor note is fruit (orange honeydew melon) with some creamy vanilla notes caramel and light toffee. Subtle spice notes and a hint of peat tease the palate. The extra aging adds depth to the whisky yet this whisky remains quite clean and fresh on the palate. Subtly spicy gently dry finish. Nicely done! (Exclusive to Binny’s Beverage Depot Chicago IL.)"
4754,6,"Part of the Jura range exhibiting ‘sweetness and smoke.’ This was aged in first-fill American oak barrels and finished in six different types of French oak casks. Nutty on the nose with freshly sawn wood savory notes and emerging ripe peaches. Very fruity on the palate with tangerines fudge cinnamon and toasted oak. Drying in the finish with nutmeg."
4755,6,"This is a single cask (#729) bottling distilled in 1982 and the outturn was just 260 bottles. Soft and supple on the waxy nose with worn leather Jaffa oranges and malt. Lots of leather with brittle toffee orange creams and a slightly musty note on the full palate. Mouth-drying in the lengthy finish but the tannins never come close to overwhelming. £280"
4756,9,"The darkest and most decadent of the three 15 year olds here. Notes of molasses demerara rum apricot and dates. More subtle notes of mixed nuts sap tobacco and fig with just a hint of Moroccan spice and leather. Surprisingly complex for a whisky this young and the most intriguing of the younger expressions reviewed here. (Bottled for Beltramo’s Fine Wines & Spirits)"
4757,9,"Deep gold color. Nicely balanced aroma of honeyed malt fruit floral notes and a hint of the sea. Medium in body and smooth. The palate begins with soothing honey notes followed by a rich maltiness. Ripe fruit flavors emerge lush and delicious. The whisky eventually becomes dry and floral with a suggestion of salt."
4758,6,"A showcase of the wide range of Talisker’s characteristics. Very sweet fruits vanilla new leather and a hint of brine on the nose. Smooth on the palate with smoky dark berries lively spices and crème brûlée. Dark chocolate and slightly bitter tannins feature in the finish along with ginger and very mild chili. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
4759,1,"Old gold in color. Obviously an old whisky but a delicate one that has subtle complexities; the balance between the dried grass/hayloft the dried orange peel and stewed apple for example. Sweet and fragrant it shows chypre notes with water alongside a more gentle floral aspect. The palate is drier than the nose suggests quite mineral with a lacy character. The finish shows melon and mint. Glen Grant in gentle repose.£88"
4760,6,"Distilled in October 1995 and aged in refill hogshead #8937. Slightly earthy on the early nose with allspice vanilla then creamy toffee and caramel notes emerge. Big boiled sweet notes on the full palate: nutmeg soft toffee and aniseed. Long and drying in the finish with chili spice. (261 bottles)"
4761,6,"Distilled in June 2007 and bottled in October 2016 this expression spent 6 years in first-fill bourbon casks then 3 years in Barolo wine casks. Fresh on the early nose; herbaceous with pineapple and a hint of oil. Big in the mouth with white pepper more pineapple dried fruits and coconut milk. Drying to tannins with dark berries in the lengthy minty finish. (10800 bottles)"
4762,1,"Though this has been on the shelves in the UK for a while its U.S. release has been delayed. It shows a classic mature ‘Rothes nose mixing moist fruitcake vanilla and a tickle of maltiness. What sets this apart is the weight of the stewed fruit and a dry note reminiscent of light rain on tweed. The palate is typically slow with a sparky spiciness and a lick of hazelnut butter to caress your throat. Worth the wait."
4763,1,"A vatting of sherry casks from (apparently) royally significant dates with an outturn of 2012 (get it?) bottles. Auburn in color it has a fruit compote nose mixed with citrus and a little hint of gravy browning in the background. This mix of the exotic—oil of clove on the tongue the sweet and light grip—makes for a very intriguing concentrated and layered palate. Think of Turkish Delight and crystallized ginger. Try the distillery shop for stock. £350"
4764,1,"The least well-known of the Fogwatt trio which includes Longmorn and BenRiach it’s unlikely that Glen Elgin will become a major brand anytime soon given how important it is to blenders. A combination of long slow ferments and distillation coupled with worm tubs gives a ludicrously fruity spirit which here is bulging with ripe peach apricot and Galia melon coated in cinnamon and nutmeg given thick weight by the worm tubs. A classic. £34"
4765,9,"Amber copper color. Very mature aroma of oak damp earth peat smoke licorice soft citrus and seaweed. Full-bodied and somewhat oily. A gently sweet vanilla note up front-albeit very briefly-then a quick flash of citrus fruit and seaweed. After that it's a battle between peat smoke and oak with the oak ultimately winning. Very long dry smoky finish."
4766,9,"Very traditional West Highland style: somewhat rustic muscular and oily in texture with notes of leather bourbon espresso orange peel kiwi and a suggestion of ultra-aged Caribbean rum. Occasionally a softer side of vanilla and coconut shows itself but if this whiskey were a man he would be a lumberjack."
4786,1,"This comes from a refill butt and has a light paler color. The lack of huge oak interaction has given an amazing freshness; think of freshly-applied plaster syrup hot green bracken a touch of nuttiness. It takes water well allowing pure soft fruits to come through and it is these which become almost syrup-like in the mouth while never losing Glenfarclas’ central depth and roasty richness in the center. £865"
4767,6,"This is the latest in an ongoing series of releases of whisky distilled at the Campbeltown distillery of Glengyle and now aged 8 years. Just 9000 bottles are available. The nose is full with over-ripe oranges warm honey and custard. On the palate the oranges are fresher and livelier with vanilla hard toffee and a slightly citric fruit edge to balance the sweetness. That sweetness carries over into the spicy finish which is quite lengthy with a lick of licorice. £35"
4768,9,"Very robust and chewy-this whisky has plenty of gusto-with notes of toffee vanilla cream bitter chocolate powdered cocoa and almond fig cake. Background citrus (especially on the nose) tobacco and polished leather. Nice depth for such a young whisky and very exciting."
4769,6,"Distilled in March 1992 this single cask expression was matured in a refill hogshead (#1266). The nose yields heather in bloom a hint of machine oil vanilla orange fondant creams and a wisp of sweet wood smoke. Smooth on the palate with creamy orange notes gentle spice and ultimately soft peat smoke. The finish is relatively long with Jaffa orange black pepper and drying oak. (209 bottles)"
4770,6,"Valkyrie replaces the current Dark Origins expression and was matured in a combination of first-fill American oak sherry casks American oak bourbon casks and European oak sherry casks along with some refill casks. Apricots and aromatic wood smoke on the nose; slightly oily with raisins. Stewed fruits on the palate with earthy peat licorice and black pepper. Aniseed dark berry notes and wood spice in the finish."
4771,9,"Peat smoke indeed and it dovetails nicely with light toffee vanilla anise charred oak blackberry seaweed kalamata olive brine and peppercorn. Well balanced from start to lingering smoke finish and very exciting. (Exclusive to the U.S.)"
4772,9,"Leafy bonfire smoke damp kiln tar anise dark chocolate and a hint of clove. All this is balanced by an underlying malty foundation and a kiss of honey vanilla and tropical fruit. Nice to see single cask cask strength bottlings of peated BenRiach. (Exclusive to The Party Source)"
4773,1,"Longmorn always has this fruitcake thing going on and this is no exception. A sherry hoggie  helped provide sultana cake mix grilled almond rhubarb puree and a little cigar box. The palate is very fruity with light Darjeeling-like tannins then red fruits. It becomes nuttier as it moves and needs water to add ripeness to the stone fruit base. Highly recommended and extremely well priced. £80"
4774,9,"The most richly textured and complex of the unpeated expressions. Base notes of honeyed malt and creamy vanilla are complemented by citrus fruit (lemon tangerine) coconut bitter chocolate exotic wood shavings and a hint of assorted nuts. Polished oak finish."
4775,6,"Gordon & MacPhail bottled a 21 year old expression from Scotland’s northernmost mainland distillery for the U.S. market earlier this year. Sweet on the nose with honey and vanilla; fleetingly stewed apricots and peaches plus a hint of caramel. Intensely focused sweet tropical fruits on the palate with barley sugar. Becoming nuttier with an edge of mixed spices. Spice fading to milk chocolate in the medium-length finish with just a suggestion of brine."
4776,6,"Following on from Thor Loki is the second release in Highland Park’s Valhalla Collection. Loki has been matured in a mix of sherry and heavily-peated casks. Initial notes of marzipan on the nose then orange oriental spices and chili. In time yellow plums vanilla and floral notes. Soft and sweet on the palate with pink grapefruit overt smoke and a touch of salt. The finish features contrasting barbecue and vanilla notes citrus and lots of spice."
4777,6,"As part of a rebranding of the entire Talisker range Diageo has brought its Special Releases 25 and 30 year old cask strength expressions into the full-time fold reduced in strength to 45.8%. Sweet and buttery on the nose; soft fruits and fragrant malt milk chocolate and dry crumbling peat. Citrus fruits (notably lemon) licorice sticks black pepper and scorched wood on the palate. Dry and oaky in the lengthy finish with peat notes and allspice to the end. £300"
4778,6,"Original is eager to please yet not lacking complexity. A soft nose features honey vanilla sweet orange and caramel. Hazelnuts dipped in honey and more orange along with red apples on the rounded buttery palate. Vanilla and cocoa powder in the lightly spiced finish which boasts just a hint of smoke."
4779,6,"Aged in bourbon casks this offers a nose of farmyard aromas ginger and treacle. Quite thin in the mouth with nutty toffee dried apricots and spicy black coffee. Dark chocolate licorice raisins dark oak and persistent cocoa powder in the spicy very long finish. Quirky and one for lovers of the slightly arcane. (£500)"
4780,6,"One of two new Glen Garioch vintages to be produced under the auspices of Morrison Bowmore Distillers’ master blender Rachel Barrie this 1995 offering is due to appear in the U.S. next year. 1000 cases are available and maturation has taken place in first-fill bourbon casks. Spice vanilla pears honey and very discreet smoke on the nose. Hazelnuts baked bananas apple strudel and lots of spice on the sweet creamy palate backed up by a gentle note of lingering char. £55"
4781,6,"This 15 year old bottling of Diageo’s Sutherland single malt comes courtesy of The Creative Whisky Co. whose Exclusive Malts range of single cask cask strength Scotch malt whiskies has recently been imported into the U.S. Fleeting burnt sugar on the nose then mango and brittle toffee. Vanilla emerges with slightly smoky malt. Finally cloves. Mouth-coating with lively spices fruit and nut milk chocolate on the palate. Relatively long in the finish with ginger snaps and a wax-like texture."
4782,9,"The rich sweet Sauternes dessert wine adds its signature. Quite lush with golden raisin crème brûlée rhubarb pie honey-kissed citrus and creamy vanilla. A lovely example of a dessert whisky — comforting warming and embracing. (I would also enjoy this after a brunch of crepes fresh fruit and maple syrup.)"
4783,6,"The Dalmore has added a new expression to its Travel Retail portfolio namely Valour. This variant carries no age statement and maturation began in first-fill bourbon casks and 30 year old Matusalem oloroso sherry butts before undergoing a finishing period in port pipes. The result is a nose of black currants caramel and musty sherry. The palate is medium-sweet with damsons Jaffa oranges and printer’s ink. Dark berries emerge in time. The finish embraces drying spices figs and mildly astringent oak."
4784,6,"This staple bottling is aged primarily in bourbon barrels along with a modest portion from sherry casks. The nose yields tropical fruit hazelnuts caramelized sugar and cereal notes. On the palate there’s barley vanilla coconut milk a hint of sherry light oak and ginger. The medium-length finish offers black tea and black pepper. An ideal stepping-stone from bourbon to single malt scotch. Best Values"
4785,6,"Sweet peat on the early nose with pineapple toffee apples and coconut. Slightly savory with wood fire ashes. Somewhat oily on the palate where sweet peat begins to dry along with oranges apricots and marshmallows. The finish is relatively long with vanilla and fresh oak dipped in hot tar."
4787,1,"Soft and direct. The initial impression is of birthday cake icing with marzipan beneath then comes preserved lemon greengage and discreet maltiness. It becomes more scented (linden/privet blossom) in time. The palate is a little strong initially then a hint of coconut. Improves further with water showing a fascinating subtle evolution: herbal with iris flowers. A classy dram from an overlooked distillery. Check it out. £53"
4788,6,"One of anCnoc’s peated expressions Rascan’s barley was peated to 11.1 ppm and aged in bourbon barrels for what the distiller describes as “nearly a decade.” The nose gives sweet smoke with ripe peaches and a hint of barbecue. Vanilla emerges and the aroma becomes floral. Apples vanilla fudge and peat smoke on the palate. The smoke dries slowly with citrus fruit giving way to oak and chile."
4789,1,"This is Mortlach in musing mode. An aroma that initially brings to mind a woolen mill then opens into sweet spice light syrup with the sense of the distillery’s weight always present. A rippling kind of muscularity with some rapeseed oil. With water the palate starts lighter and more fruity than you’d expect then comes rooty weight with yes a distinctly gingery slant. Water shows more beeswax/honeycomb. Substantial and spicy. £85"
4790,6,"This is the second edition of Evolution first released in 2013 and the ABV has been reduced from 57.2% to 50%. Like the first it was matured in first-fill Tennessee whiskey barrels. The nose gives vanilla ginger honey tropical fruits and milk chocolate plus a floral note. More vanilla milky coffee oak honey toffee and pineapple on the oily palate. Spicy caramel in the finish."
4791,6,"The entry level anCnoc is aged principally in bourbon barrels with a small element of sherry wood-matured spirit included in the mix. Floral and quite delicate on the nose with barley apples and honey. Medium-bodied smooth and well-balanced with more honey apple malt vanilla and cinnamon. The finish is relatively short drying and mildly oaky."
4792,6,"John Crabbie & Co is in the process of returning whisky distilling to Leith Edinburgh but in the meantime it has launched this single malt from an unspecified Highlands distillery. The nose is light and youthful with vanilla apple peel peanuts and developing mild oak. Clean and straightforward on the palate with more apple butterscotch and cinnamon spice. Spicy oak in the medium length finish. Perfect for cocktails."
4793,10,"This bruiser is not afraid to show its softer side to the world. Earthy wet turf smoke grilled bacon fat faint vanilla menthol and brand new erasers make quite a statement. But inside it’s all about a creamy light vanilla base with aniseed clove ginger and smoky bacon that capitulate to fruitier elements of banana and honeydew which retreat with a drying spicy finish."
4794,6,"This was aged in a refill American oak hogshead as was the 1981 expression. Like that variant it has pineapple and lemon on the nose and also yields milk chocolate green apples and fresh-sawn wood. Smooth full and sweet on the palate again with very ripe tropical fruits plus apple pie. The finish is medium in length; quite austere."
4795,10,"Jura has been partial to releasing 13 year old limited editions over the years so this independent bottling attempts to compete with grassy notes orchard fruit aniseed peppercorn lemon pith and hints of jellied fruits. There is dried banana mandarin orange Jell-O Italian meringue and a little pepper to taste with bitter orange on the finish. Perfectly serviceable but the flavors seem a little stuck on repeat."
4796,1,"Restrained ozonic with no great smokiness to open but there is a touch of green grass behind meadow flowers and salt-washed stones so typical of the distillery. With water another marker—drying fishing nets—comes through with breaths of the sea. Subtle and refined. More smoke on the palate where it’s like a flowering currant bush on fire. Great balance of different elements: smoke fragrance oil acidity. With water real saltiness comes through. Very good. £99"
4797,1,"After the 68’s quiet nature we reach Balvenie in fully mature robust character—well as robust as Balvenie ever gets. That means more cask-derived notes of vanilla ice butterscotch crème brûlée and a jag of citrus bringing you to your senses. There’s squidgy caramel toffee and the honey is now fixed in the comb adding that distinct waxiness of old gently matured whisky. The biggest and sweetest of the series. Excellent."
4798,1,"This strikes me as being the most overtly smoky of Kilchoman’s recent bottlings and also the sweetest. Intense and very forward there’s baked apple humidor notes honeydew melon fresh shellfish. Water brings out a putty-like youthfulness so take it neat. The palate is amazingly sweet (think golden syrup) then the smoke folds itself over. A good—and well-priced—introduction for newcomers.(World of Whiskies UK Travel Retail only) £45"
4799,6,"Part of Signatory’s Un-Chillfiltered Collection this was distilled on February 25 2005 and bottled on November 25 2015. Initially a little earthy on the nose then more fragrant with orange blossom nutmeg and a hint of polished oak. Oily and rounded on the palate with supple sherry influences: prunes dates more orange and tingling spices plus toffee. The finish is medium to long with a hint of smoke and lingering spicy Jaffa orange notes."
4800,1,"There appears to be a concerted effort to bring this distillery out of the shadows: A Good Thing in my opinion. This limited
release is very Cardhu with masses of mandarin dried peach and honey reminiscent of a fine oxidized Chinese Phoenix Oolong tea while still retaining the effervescent buzz of youth. Akin to a fine Cuban rum on the tongue with bittersweet chocolate dark cherry and tangy spicy life it dies a little quickly but is a lovely dram. £160"
4801,6,"Highland Park suggests this is its peatiest whisky to date. Smoky roasted malt notes
on the nose with singed wood and a slowly developing floral note. Initially sweeter
than expected on the palate with vanilla and apricots then dark peat licorice and
treacle toffee notes appear. Black tea and black pepper in the finish along with a hint
of pineapple. £60"
4802,9,"Matured in a port pipe. The third in a trilogy (the other two being bourbon and sherry cask-aged). I like this one better than the sherry cask 1990 vintage but not quite as much as the bourbon cask bottling which was in our Top Ten whiskies two years ago. Lovely amber ruby color. The port flavors are obvious but not sappy or dominating. They’re clean and contribute a layered sweetness and ripe red berry fruit notes to the traditional moderately peated Bowmore smoke and peat. Lingering smoke and chocolate on the finish."
4803,9,"Amber mahogany color. Its 50 years of age are evident in the nose-there's plenty of resinous wood spice notes (especially clove). Also on the nose is citrus (especially orange) a potpourri of dried fruit light toffee and a hint of smoked nuts. The body is thick and viscous. The palate expresses flavors similar to its aroma finishing dry and long."
4905,9,"A distinctive (and intriguing) Bruichladdich with honeyed malt vanilla pod charcoal exotic fruit and dark chocolate bourbon balls teased with suggestions of fennel and espresso bean. Tactile leather finish. (A D&M Wines & Liquors exclusive.)"
4804,1,"Here’s a classical Port Ellen where the intense even monomaniacal delivery of smoke mixes with damp face flannel purple smoke green ferns and rapeseed oil. Lots of minerality to the point of being almost flintily uncompromising. Water makes it more naked. The palate is excellent with an explosion of preserved lemon-accented smokiness touches of Spanish paprika a sweet syrupy center before a massive licorice finish. Peatiness for the purist but whenever was that different? (2958 bottles)."
4805,1,"The aim with Benromach was always to rediscover an older Speyside style and this shows how well owner Gordon & MacPhail has succeeded. There’s a profound sherried introduction just a little malt then it is all fruitcakes and light smoke. The palate is properly old-style and oily with some pleasing zingy orange peel toward the back of the palate. Chewy and medium-bodied with good layering."
4806,9,"Medium-bodied and nicely textured. Good balance of flavors -- and well-integrated too -- with lovely sweet notes (cereal grain cookie dough caramel and vanilla cream) young heathery peat tar fishnets and brine that is complementary but not aggressive with a suggestion of lavender and tangerine. Balanced finish. (332 bottles produced.)"
4807,6,"William Grant & Sons’ Land Cask is a peated Lowland single malt from an undisclosed distillery. Sweet peat smoke and tangy orange on the nose. More orange plus vanilla toffee and peaty oak on the smooth medium palate. Peat smoke and earthy nutty toffee in the finish. Straightforward but eminently drinkable. £22"
4808,6,"This is the second ‘Green’ release from Springbank denoting the use of organic barley following on from a 12 year old in 2014. This variant has been fully matured in sherry casks and 9000 bottles are available. White pepper ozone and wet sand on the early nose. Ultimately cocoa powder baked apple and sultanas. The palate is initially very sweet and spicy with salt and fruity sherry developing. The finish is medium to long warming with a salty tang."
4809,6,"This single cask 17 year old expression of Ben Nevis was matured in a sherry butt which yielded 747 bottles. It appears in Carn Mor’s “Strictly Limited” series of releases and has not been chill filtered. The bold nose opens with slightly savory notes and hard-boiled eggs. Sherry malt and figs subsequently develop. Quite full-bodied with rich Jaffa orange and developing plain chocolate on the palate. More dark chocolate and a suggestion of fennel in the medium-length finish. £55"
4810,7,"From an undisclosed North Highland distillery aged in a refill sherry hogshead. The impact of the sherry is clear with ripe blackberry and peach. A floral sweet clover honey note rounds out a deliciously lush mouthfeel. This lushness is well balanced by a spicy mid-palate that features black pepper ginger and strong salinity that help provide some real depth. A long and slightly dry finish wraps up a solid whisky. (U.S. only)"
4811,6,"Diurachs are the inhabitants of the Isle of Jura and this single malt named in their honor is initially matured in bourbon casks before 2 years of finishing in amoroso sherry casks. Floral and honeyed on the nose with caramel pine and spicy dark chocolate. Sweet and oily on the palate where the chocolate changes from plain to milk with vanilla and delicate cloves. Darkening chocolate and drying oak in the finish."
4812,6,"This vintage expression from Tomatin has been matured in a mix of bourbon and port casks and is being released in batches. The first comprises 2500 bottles. The soft fragrant nose offers strawberries apricots honey and caramel with a final hint of dry port. Fruit and caramel notes carry over from the nose onto the palate before dark chocolate appears along with a suggestion of smoke. Subtle oak and ginger in the lengthy finish."
4813,6,"Tomatin launched the peated Cù Bòcan expression last year and follows it with a vintage variant the result of “…a rare and unintentional production of peated whisky at the distillery on 7th June 1989.” Three bourbon casks yielded 1080 bottles. Ripe apples and aerosol furniture polish with a vanilla and sweet woodsmoke backdrop on the nose. Full-bodied with intense sweet fruit notes on the palate and a heathery smoky kick. Smoky spice and nutty flavors in the ultimately drying finish. £200"
4814,6,"Maturation of the Pentland Skerries bottling of the Lighthouse Collection has taken place exclusively in former Spanish sherry casks which lends the nose rich dark sherry and Christmas cake notes caramel and old leather along with the distillery’s characteristic saltiness which here comes across as salted peanuts. Full-bodied and slick in the mouth overt sherry sultanas figs spice and contrasting brine. Mild maritime notes and autumn fruits combine with prunes and sherry in an accomplished after-dinner finish. £55/liter"
4815,6,"The first of four ‘chapters’ under the Renaissance banner all of which will consist of spirit made since Glen Garioch reopened in 1997. This 15 year old release has been matured in sherry and bourbon casks and 12000 bottles are available. Ginger features on the early perfumed nose with soft toffee oranges and dates. Milk chocolate on the creamy palate where the ginger theme continues along with cinnamon and caramel. The finish offers rich chocolate and orange which finally fades. £75"
4816,9,"Straw gold color. Very mature aromas of oak and citrus with a hint of smoke dry vanilla floral and spice notes. Flavors are very mature and fairly dry throughout mirroring the aroma’s dominant oaky vanilla notes with citrus and subtle smoke. Long lingering finish."
4817,6,"This NAS Glenmorangie contains whisky aged in bourbon casks and some that was ‘extra-matured’ in Spanish oloroso sherry casks as per Glenmoragie Lasanta. The result is a variant with more of a winter fireside vibe than found in Original. The nose boasts dates plain chocolate caramel and Jaffa oranges. Rich and fruity in the mouth with more oranges plus sultanas roasted chestnuts cinnamon and ginger. The finish is medium in length fruity gingery and ultimately slightly bitter. £40"
4818,6,"Glansa is described as a “peated whisky cask finish” with the majority of its unspecified maturation time being spent in first-fill American oak casks. Madeira notes on the nose with vanilla honey and pears. Richly fruity on the palate with cocoa powder vanilla caramel and mild wood smoke. Dark berries emerge from the background. The dark fruits continue through the lengthy finish where smokiness increases."
4819,6,"This is the second batch of Silveroak 1990 from Auchentoshan and it has benefited from an extra year of maturation in bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. The 22 year old is exclusive to Travel Retail outlets. Notably floral on the nose with fudge banana ginger and attractive oak. On the palate it delivers vanilla apricots apples more ginger and oak. The finish is long and spicy with dark coffee notes and a hint of menthol. Greater complexity than its predecessor."
4820,9,"Aged in a sherry cask and the sherry is clean and bright. I’m also picking up a good dose of warming peat smoke along with molasses and a gentle maltiness throughout. A peppering of subtle brine and a hint of seaweed peak through occasionally reminding one of its Islay roots."
4821,7,"This cask strength port cask-aged whisky comes from an undisclosed distillery near Aberlour. The impact of the port cask is unmistakable with a nose that is deeply fruity with dried apricot blackberry jam honey and malt. On the palate these rich sweet fruit notes are well balanced by black pepper clove salt honey and a touch of dark chocolate. The underlying proof also helps counterbalance the sweet fruit and drives a medium length and slightly dry finish. (U.S. only)"
4822,6,"Distilled in October 1997 and aged in a single refill hogshead 360 bottles were released in 2014 as part of Langside’s Distiller’s Art range. The nose is mildly herbal with green wood heather and developing soft toffee notes. Soft and gently spiced on the palate with hazelnuts and peaches in cream. The finish is relatively long with milk chocolate and tingling sweet spices. £62"
4823,6,"This 21 year old from Tobermory is of the peated Ledaig variety though sampling confirms that the level of peating in Ledaig malt has been significantly ramped up since this was produced. Sweet on the nose with subtle aromatic smoke unsalted butter peaches in syrup and heather honey. Luscious and viscous on the sweet fruity palate with honey underlying soft spices and some gentle smoke. Slowly drying in the finish to licorice root and black coffee. £110"
4824,9,"Gold color (as its name suggests) with a hint of copper. This whisky which was finished in Caribbean rum casks follows on the heels of the limited edition The Balvenie 17 year old Rum Cask. The 17 year old was pleasant enough but quite sweet (I rated it an 80). This new Golden Cask is an improvement because the higher alcohol level along with an array of dried spice helps to balance the sweet rum notes. Lively bright tangerine nectarine and pineapple combine with Balvenie’s signature honey nougat Heath bar light molasses and milk chocolate. Dried spice (vanilla cinnamon nutmeg) and gritty oak resin kick in on the finish rounding everything out quite nicely. Now if we could only have the best of both worlds -- the balance of the Golden Cask 14 year old and the maturity of the 17 year old. That could be a whisky worthy of a 90s rating. (Travel Retail Exclusive) Price per liter."
4825,6,"Illicit Stills is the first in a trilogy of limited releases reflecting Arran’s distilling heritage. It includes unpeated Arran spirit some of which has been aged in port pipes along with amounts of medium-peated and heavily-peated whisky. Warm and rounded on the oily nose; figs and peat before caramel and vanilla develop. Viscous in the mouth with succulent orange and spicy peat. The finish is very long and peppery with mouth-drying tannins. £85"
4826,7,"A non-chill filtered cask strength single malt from Littlemill vintage 1991. Littlemill’s sweet nose is inviting with butter toffee milk chocolate dried apricot and straw. On the palate these notes are joined by a nice maltiness as well as a touch of salt. In the mid-palate we get a touch of spice (black pepper and cinnamon) and some citrus. The finish is medium-length and slightly acidic a departure for an otherwise affable cask strength whisky. (Park Avenue Liquor only)"
4827,6,"This bourbon-cask matured 12 year old was distilled using organic barley. 9000 bottles released globally. Pears and pineapple in brine on the early nose. Peanut brittle licorice and subtle peat. Sweet and intensely fruity on the viscous palate with developing nuttiness vanilla spice and peat smoke. The finish is medium in length with sweet fruit more licorice and sea salt."
4828,6,"This Highland Park bottling appears in Douglas Laing’s prestigious XOP range and after distillation in September 1994 the spirit in question was matured in a single refill hogshead (#10897) before bottling in September 2015. The outturn is just 228 bottles. Boiled fruit sweets and malt on the nose with underlying sea salt and gentle leathery smoke. Confident in the mouth with allspice honey barley and wood smoke. The finish is lengthy with drying oak and peat. £155"
4829,6,"Wemyss Malts has bottled several single cask Auchentoshans in the past and this 15 year old release is of 342 bottles provided by a bourbon barrel. Peaches caramel sea salt and developing lemonade on the nose. Sweet and fruity on the palate with more peaches and very soft background spices. The finish dries slowly with ginger and a hint of aniseed. £75"
4830,9,"Gold color. Soft delicate aroma of fruit gum drops vanilla and a touch of honey. Light in body with a soft texture. Its flavors are like its aroma nicely balanced with a gentle finish."
4831,1,"Distilled in 2009 so remember this is only 5 years old. At this stage there’s not a lot of cask but there is an insanely intense smoky herbal note like eucalyptus celery spruce pine resin then some angelica and a crisp mineral edge. The palate is balanced between this intensity big smoke and Bruichladdich’s typical oily sweet core. Water doesn’t affect it one little bit. It is bold it is proud it is in charge. I like its sheer ballsiness. £110"
4832,6,"This 15 year old has been fully matured in bourbon casks. Relatively reticent on the nose with light vanilla. Becoming more aromatic and spicy with tinned apricots in syrup. Medium-bodied relatively dry with ginger oak and cloves before a touch of milk chocolate appears. The chocolate darkens. Aniseed and perpetual spice."
4833,6,"A new small-batch addition to the Aberlour line-up Casg Annamh (Gaelic for ‘rare cask’) has been matured in European and American oak oloroso sherry casks. Rich buttery caramel aromas grilled pineapple and ginger. The palate is smooth and yields spicy vanilla tangerines and cloves. Lots of black pepper and licorice in the relatively long finish. Less complex than the distillery’s A’bunadh."
4834,1,"What would you expect from an 8 year old Laphroaig? Iodine massive peat aggression? Not here. Rather there’s a soft marine sweetness akin to lobster thermidor with hints of salinity and tarragon. It builds in heft and smoke but there is real balance. Complex already. The palate initially shows muted smoke and is slightly medicinal with balancing creaminess. Water shatters this idyll somewhat as the phenols come out in full force. It depends what side you want. I’d grab some. £60"
4835,1,"This hails from the first of Rothes’ stock that was specifically laid down for the vintage release program. The nose shows typical Rothes softness — woolen blankets and malted milk. As it opens. there’s wet linen caramel fudge and a hint of mixed berry and dark fruits slowly collapsing into jam. A touch of sherried nuttiness on the palate is followed by thick clover honey and a little crisp malt. The finish is gentle lightly spiced with a touch of struck match sulfur."
4836,6,"This single cask cask-strength bottling was matured in a port hogshead. Slightly sharp on the initial nose savory and a touch vegetal. The palate is full and malty offering creamy toffee hazelnuts ripe peaches and ginger. Creaminess lasts through the cinnamon-spiced medium-length finish. (290 bottles)"
5096,9,"This whisky starts with the light and very drinkable bourbon oak-aged 1993 vintage from previous years and then is finished off in a sherry cask. The sherry is fresh and vibrant and adds lush fruit light dates and nutty undertone to Tullibardine’s classic vanilla honeyed malt and grassy notes. Delicious!"
4837,10,"Lemon meringue pie flaked almonds cereal bars almost porridge-like enlivened by the tiniest pinch of allspice. A ferocious peppery intensity saves itself for the palate where it tramples all over the lemon zest and apple flavors without mercy. Once the conquering spices call it a day this is a sweeter concoction with soft fudge brown sugar and blueberry muffin. In the finish the allspice has the final word. (Batch 3; 162 bottles)"
4838,9,"Orange marmalade color. Aromas of ripe fruit (orange strawberry red raspberry) caramel and toffee with a subtle Spanish oak resin spiciness. Medium to full in body with a silky texture. Nicely balanced on the palate and very well integrated flavors similar to the aromas. Silky smooth finish."
4839,1,"This is Caol Ila not only in unpeated guise but from a ‘bodega-treated’ sherry butt. Full and lush the distillery’s pear and melon here are in super-ripe guise alongside sweet biscuits mashed banana and Mars bar. With water it’s more a cabinetmaker’s workshop—but isn’t woody. The mouth is sweet and concentrated with jabs of raspberry and hedgerow fruits. Who needs peat? My best value bottling this issue."
4840,10,"An aged island dram to mull over during the distillery’s lengthy closure for essential upgrades this brims with lemon sherbet summer fruits including cantaloupe and Bartlett pears poached in cream. Tangy citrus balanced with ginger and peppery spice cocoa notes and black bun make for a lively mouthfeel. Creamy fudge and Jaffa cake rule once the spices die back. An enchantingly delicate orange sorbet flavor appears when diluted."
4841,6,"This expression from the Isle of Arran distillery appeared in 2010 and one-third of the component whiskies were matured in European oak casks while two-thirds came from American oak. Very fragrant and perfumed on the nose with peaches brandy and ginger snaps plus vanilla and mild oak. Smooth and creamy on the palate with spicy summer fruits apricots and hazelnuts. The lingering finish is spicy biscuity and slowly drying with just a hint of salt."
4842,9,"(Reviewer's note: This is a bottling exclusive to Sam's Wine & Spirits in Chicago IL.) Springbank bottlings over the past few years have been variable but improving. The less inspiring ones have been too heavily sherried and/or lacked the classic Springbank freshness liveliness and briny character one has come to expect from a Campbeltown whisky. This one is indeed from a sherry cask. It's still not the classic Springbanks we were spoiled with in the 1990s but it's delicious nonetheless. Yes there's plenty of sherry (and these notes contribute lush fruit toffee and nuts) but the youth and zest of this whisky cuts through it and balances it nicely with those familiar brine and coconut notes interwoven throughout. A bold and satisfying Springer with more character that the 175th Anniversary 12 year old distillery bottling that has been in circulation."
4843,6,"This cask strength Northern Highlander offers a full and complex nose comprising brandy notes stewed apricots spices table salt and white pepper. A hint of nougat turns to darker caramel. Rich on the palate mouth-coating sweet with lively spices. The finish is buttery with a pinch of ginger and a final brandy-and-soda finish."
4844,9,"Powerful mature and nicely rounded. Similar in some ways to the Springer 10 year old 46% reviewed below with the addition of toasted coconut and caramel. It’s also more rounded and with greater depth."
4845,6,"Melon notes to the fore early on the nose; floral especially carnations. Progressively more caramel with Parma violet sweets. Pretty and feminine. Richer and fuller-bodied on the palate than the nose might suggest. Fresh fruit apple juice almonds and gentle spices slowly moving to milky coffee in the finish. The faintest hint of smoke pervades the flavor but is very much a ‘bit part’ player in the ensemble."
4846,6,"Recently added to Chivas Brothers’ lineup of Cask Strength Edition whiskies this Eastern Highland single malt from the ‘lost’ distillery of Glenugie in the fishing port of Peterhead is perfumed on the nose with discreet sherry cocoa fresh leather blackcurrants peaches and apricots. The palate is initially sweet with fresh fruit but old-fashioned cough drops and black coffee notes soon arrive. Very long in the spicy tannic oak finish. Exclusive to Chivas Brothers’ distillery visitor centers and www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com (500 bottles). £250"
4847,6,"Explorer Jock Wishart’s successful ‘Row to the Pole’ expedition is celebrated with this 3000 bottle commemorative edition matured in ex-American and ex-Spanish oak sherry casks selected by distillery manager Malcolm Waring. New-mown grass ripe apples brine and a whiff of Arbroath smokies on the nose. Citrus fruit spices and milk chocolate on the palate with sherry lending gravitas. The finish is sweet full and lengthy with brine returning at the last. £20 (350 ml)"
4848,6,"Glenglassaugh distillery has released a number of country-exclusive expressions recently including this 37 year old single cask (470 bottles) for North America under the Master Distillers Selection banner.

Persistently spicy in the finish with background citrus fruits."
4849,6,"There have been three previous Special Release offerings of Dalwhinnie and this 1987 distillation is the first to have been aged in rejuvenated American oak hogsheads. Cloves are to the fore on the aromatic nose along with cinnamon ginger fudge and tropical fruits. Initially oily and honeyed on the palate with developing spice wood resin and herbal flavors. Spicy oak in the lengthy finish with a return to the initial note of cloves. 5358 bottles."
4850,6,"With the percentage of former oloroso sherry-matured spirit ramped up to 60 percent in this Dee variant the nose is deeper and richer than that of the Tweed Dram; Seville orange marmalade and a hint of cocoa. More immediate dark chocolate on the palate with raisins and walnuts. The finish is lengthy with plums black coffee and a suggestion of licorice. £42 Currently not available in the U.S."
4851,6,"Distilled in October 1991 this 20 year old Private Collection expression of Balblair spent 40 months of secondary maturation in casks sourced from Crozes-Hermitage the largest AOC in the northern Rhône wine-producing region of France. The nose offers red currants sultanas vanilla and white pepper. The palate is initially soft and sweet with summer fruits but gradually darkens and dries. The finish features dark chocolate and raisins. 2000 bottles."
4852,6,"Comprising 80 percent American white oak-matured whisky and 20 percent from ex-oloroso sherry casks the Tweed Dram offers lots of citrus fruit on the nose with an early dusting of icing sugar then orange and lemon wine gums. Relatively light and fresh with gentle fudge notes. Malt toffee cinnamon and over-ripe oranges on the spicy palate. Quite long in the finish with spicy oak nutmeg and lingering dark chocolate notes. £42 Currently not available in the U.S."
4853,6,"The Old Malt Cask ‘Royal Jubilee Commemorative Bottle’ appropriately comes from one of two surviving Scottish distilleries with a ‘royal’ prefix namely Brackla located in the Northern Highland region near Nairn. Maturation has taken place in a refill sherry cask. The nose is like a damp empty house with herbal notes pencil shavings oranges and pine needles. Full-bodied and spicy with freshly-sawn timber pine and brittle toffee on the palate. Citric with camphor and pepper in the finish. 250 bottles. £50"
4854,6,"The first Kilkerran “work in progress” bottling from Glengyle distillery appeared in 2009 and the ultimate aim is to bottle a 12 year old expression. For now we have separate sherry butt-matured and bourbon barrel-matured expressions for 2013. The bourbon-aged variant offers vanilla cinnamon milk chocolate ripe apples and ultimately slightly smoky mango notes on the nose. Spicy on the palate with blood orange and a hint of peat smoke. The medium-length finish is drying with a wisp of smoke. £38"
4855,6,"This most recent Connoisseurs’ Choice bottling from Scotland’s southernmost distillery has been matured in refill sherry hogsheads. The nose is pleasing and light mildly herbal with cut grass citrus fruits and a hint of malt. Medium-bodied sweet and fruity in the mouth with peaches nuts and discreet spice. Relatively lengthy in the creamy finish. Very drinkable and quite substantial."
4856,6,"This expression of the triple-distilled Lowland single malt is a 14 year old single cask bottling and just 314 bottles are available. Fresh pineapple and vanilla toffee on the fragrant soft nose. The palate is lively and fruity with lemon zest caramel a hint of black pepper and then deeper fruit notes of ripe peach. The finish is quite lengthy with lingering fruit flavors. £55"
4857,6,"The latest single cask expression of Auchentoshan from Wemyss Malts is 14 years old and was matured in a bourbon barrel. The outturn is 342 bottles. The nose is fleetingly herbal; then offers crème de citron turning to tinned peaches in syrup and finally pine and peppery caramel. Silky-smooth in the mouth spicy with lemon and digestive biscuits. Freshly-squeezed lemon lingers in the chili and chocolaty finish. £78"
4858,1,"Tempest to the world Dorus Mor in the U.S. this has an intensely salty start that’s
like being slapped by a wave on Bowmore’s harbor wall. That marine note
continues: samphire clams with a squeeze of lemon. Water brings out wet clay.
The palate is equally briny but with a sprig of lavender then soft fruits
wreathed in peat smoke. It’s tense and coiled with real energy when neat but
it’s best like that so deal with the heat."
4859,6,"Bottled by Ian Macleod Distillers from an undisclosed producer this Islay single malt may well emanate from Ardbeg. The nose offers lemon rock pools peat ash and smoky malt with a sweet honeyed floral note at its heart. Medium-bodied with big citrus flavors tingling spices brine ashy peat and aniseed. Aniseed lingers in the finish with diminishing spiciness."
4860,1,"Rich and malty and though it’ll look like I’m just reading the label there is
chocolate here: chocolate brownie mix to be precise with a raspberry sitting
on top. Bold and rich with a nutty underpinning. Water makes it very fresh and
a little more hay-like. The palate is sweet and liquorous with nougat
macadamia and a chewy mid-palate where that chocolate dribbles and melts.
Neat it is slightly bitter; less so with water. Very sound. £53"
4861,4,"It's not often that the blended whisky section can be described as 'the group of death' but at most other times this whisky would shine. It's a very good whisky rich in flavor and punching above its 40% ABV mixing creamy vanilla pureed peach and apricot key lime pie chocolate and manuka honey to great effect. It's soft and rounded with little obvious oak and the finish is feather-light with a slightly fruit sponge finale. £50"
4862,6,"As it progresses toward the ultimate goal of an 18 year old expression in 2015 Arran has released a 16 year old matured in 30
percent sherry hogsheads and 70 percent bourbon casks. The edition is limited to 9000 bottles. The nose features malt milk chocolate and honey with a citric edge. The palate mirrors the nose with more malt honey and milk chocolate plus ginger nutmeg and spicy oak. Spiced fruits in the lengthy finish. £45"
4863,6,"The fifth batch of Adelphi’s Fascadale single malt comprises a marriage of two Spanish oak casks and three American oak casks of Highland Park. The outturn is 1483 bottles. Icing sugar vanilla milk chocolate apricots plus mildly smoky malt on the nose. Full-bodied and fruity on the palate with toffee black pepper and a hint of peat in the background. The medium-length finish is slowly drying. £45"
4864,6,"Apart from the 40 year old expression launched in 2012 this is the oldest Old Pulteney on the market and annual batches are
released with slightly varying strengths. Refill bourbon casks have been used in their maturation. Sweet and zesty on the deceptively youthful nose with banoffee pie eating apples and quite sweet oak on the palate. Cereal notes and pleasing oak in the lengthy finish. £250"
4865,9,"Not all Speyside whiskies are big masculine and sherried. Some are gentler as is this expression of Tamnavulin. The whisky is creamy and smooth in texture with notes of vanilla custard honeyed malt and even a hint of marshmallow and hay. Very soothing finish. This is one of the most polished Tamnavulin whiskies I’ve tasted recently (and going from 40% to 43% in strength provided some extra richness and body). Whisky with dessert anyone?"
4866,6,"Matured for 6 to 8 years in bourbon casks before finishing in sherry casks. The early nose is earthy with dough balls then sweeter sherry notes emerge with ripe tangerines and honey. Sweet sherry fills the full palate with black pepper and developing raisins. Plain chocolate black pepper and aniseed in the relatively long finish. Distillery not disclosed."
4867,6,"One of the first releases from the recently formed Hunter Laing & Co established in Glasgow by Stewart Laing is this 20 year
old expression of Bladnoch. It was distilled in November 1992 and matured in a refill sherry cask. Lemon cake honey and ginger nuts on the pleasing nose; fruity and spicy on the palate with a savory flourish and a honey and malt backdrop. Spicy caramel and mocha coffee in the finish. £75"
4868,1,"The nose is slightly closed all very delicate with some hay-like aromas akin to harvest time. This gentleness allows sweet melon-like fruits to come through alongside patisserie icing gentle vanilla and an effect like Hedione the ‘smell’ of sunshine. Rounded and very sweet typical of the distillery with a lightly drying effect similar to powdered icing sugar. It slightly loses it with water so keep neat. A pleasant straight down the middle Laddie. £60/500 ml"
4869,9,"Fragrant and very clean. Gently sweet with notes of vanilla cream ripe barley fresh cut hay sherbet (orange and lemon) and a hint of bourbon -especially on the finish. An enjoyable and undemanding whisky to drink when the whisky itself isn’t the main topic of conversation."
4870,9,"The ""Gentle Dram"" it says on the bottle’s label and it certainly is one of the gentler whiskies in Speyside. It’s a fragrant whisky too with a firm malty foundation fruit gum drops and caramel. Subtle notes of almond and anise helped keep my interest as did its soft subtle wood spice finish. Very easy to drink too!"
4871,9,"A mélange of sugared almonds toffee sultana and citrus peel. Firm on the palate with a nutty spicy oak finish. Nicely done. (Exclusive to Binny’s Beverage Depot.)"
4872,6,"Representing House Targaryen this features its three-headed dragon on the label. Malt and honey on the subtle nose with a hint of cinnamon. Medium-bodied with milk chocolate caramel and youthful oak. Jaffa orange and gentle spice in the relatively short spiky finish."
4873,10,"An uplifting nose of golden honey linseed oil vanilla sanded oak and wheat biscuits on this west coast grain. Neat it is mouth drenching. Banana and ripe fruits are followed by juicy orange before a snarling pepper onslaught ensnares the tip of the tongue igniting a glowing ball of white heat underneath. You can bask in this experience for minutes with each sip. Water emphasizes the oak and mellows the dram to the flavor of almond-sprinkled custard. (180 bottles)"
4874,1,"The richest of the quartet. Super-dense with a note of burnished brass then light leather and cashew alongside sandalwood. The waxiness and tropical fruit typical of old whiskies is in the background before it moves into lanolin. The palate starts sweetly with added liqueur cherries earth and smoke but for me after the complex nose it fails to deliver especially since it is so scarily priced. £600/500 ml"
4875,9,"Nicely sherried. Rich with maple syrup honey-drenched citrus sultana and a good dried oak spice finish for balance. Well done for a 12 year old and definite competition for Macallan of the same age."
4876,1,"A sherry butt this time which has allowed the whisky a little more space to breathe. Although as concentrated as you'd expect here we can see more fragrance emerging and a big-boned elegance is on show — think Margaret Dumont. I pick up some rose hip syrup dried apple Armagnac/prune and a licorice note as seen on the ’62; while on the palate a good balance of rich chocolatey sweetness to offset the tannins. Big but balanced. £512"
4877,1,"A limited edition bottling to commemorate the great David Stewart’s 50th year in the business and as befits this quiet man here’s a release that rewards just sitting and listening. This gives more of a nod to Cognac than Speyside; something to do with the dried apricot orange blossom and golden syrup. The palate is gentle and layered with more dried fruits which are balanced by an almost jammy finish where finally some cereal is glimpsed."
4878,9,"A new cask-strength Glengoyne without chill-filtering. Both features put this whisky in a higher class than the entry level 10 year old. That classic clean maltiness which Glengoyne is known for is certainly in this whisky. With the addition of some water the whisky really opens up becoming fragrant fruity (cherry pits apples) along with hints of anise and almonds. A nice effort from the new owners."
4879,9,"The ruby/antique amber color suggests a first-fill sherry cask; the nose and palate confirm it. This whisky is a mouthful: fruitcake roasted chestnuts burnt raisin candied orange molasses leather tobacco dark chocolate wax and a hint of clove. An incredible amount of sherry but it’s not cloying. The flavors are clean complex and well-balanced."
4880,1,"This is a new bottler to me and they’ve made quite an arrival with this a classic Benrinnes. This is a distillery where meatiness is desirable and this is as thick and savory as a slow-cooked pheasant stew or cassoulet with an added herbal and pruney element. A real sweetness and a pleasing lift of sulfur (which can enhance whiskies) add to the complexity. Chewy on the tongue with earthiness revealed by water. £65"
4881,9,"Richly layered. A veritable fruit basket in addition to nutty toffee caramel cocoa powder and toasted coconut notes all balanced nicely by oak on the finish. Nice maturity for a relatively young whisky. (Bottled for Maxwell Street Trading Co.)"
4882,6,"The Old Particular non-chill filtered single cask expression of Highland Park was distilled in November 1995 matured in a refill hogshead and bottled in December 2013. The outturn was 322 bottles. Initially quite reticent on the nose then toffee cardboard table salt and very faint smoke. Quite viscous on the palate and dry peat becomes relatively prominent with allspice and sea salt. The finish offers licorice and lingering spices. £100"
4883,1,"When this first appeared I found it too sweet which was strange as the finishing period is in dry oloroso casks. This most recent iteration sees the finish better integrated. There’s more spiciness than on the standard 14 year old while the fruit seems plumper: more apricot and kumquat. The waxiness is there but the candle is scented. It still clings to the tongue but there is an added nutty oxidized character. A marked improvement.£47"
4884,6,"Freya is the third release in Highland Park’s Valhalla Collection; unusually it has been matured in first-fill bourbon casks. It fits into the core range between the 12 and 18 year olds. The nose is sweet floral and heathery with pineapple mango and a background earthiness. Finally vanilla and milk chocolate. Smooth on the palate with passion fruit and more overt peatiness than is apparent on the nose. Subtle peat char and a hint of licorice in the finish."
4885,6,"After 6 to 7 years of maturation in bourbon casks this spent several months in chardonnay white wine casks. The nose offers resinous wine notes melon grapefruit and a hint of vanilla. Nutty on the palate with orchard fruits more vanilla and milk chocolate. Peaches and a slightly oily note in the finish with apples nutmeg and a sprinkling of black pepper."
4886,6,"Unpeated Caol Ilas have become a regular in the Special Releases portfolio and this expression from 2000 is the eleventh to appear. The early nose is reticent and faintly floral with freshly sliced green apples. Sharp and sweet on the palate with malt and citrus fruit and even a hint of mint. Ginger mixed nuts aniseed and more mint in the medium-length finish. Diageo Special Releases 2016 bottling."
4887,6,"Highly approachable with soft earthy peat on the nose plus pineapple honey and vanilla. Warm leather ashy peat ripe pears and discreet vanilla notes on the palate. Slightly thinner than the unpeated Classic. Relatively long in the finish with peppery peat and ultimately aniseed."
4888,1,"Along with Cragganmore this is one of the underrated members of the original Classic Six. Quite why has always slightly baffled me. OK it isn’t smoky but the nose has a deep soft honeyed sweetness: think caramelized fruits hints of thick cream and a light touch of fennel and sharp citrus. Thick in the center and very gentle it’s that chunkiness in the middle that is the secret to its beauty."
4889,6,"After 6 to 7 years in a bourbon cask this is finished for 9 to 12 months in oloroso casks. Sweet sherry glacé cherries butterscotch and roses on the nose. Medium-bodied with caramel dark chocolate-cherry liqueur and warming spices. The finish yields black currant cough medicine then allspice and slowly drying oak."
4890,6,"From a refill sherry butt this bottling of Glen Scotia was released in September 2015 as a 24 year old. Oily on the nose with dirty sherry ginger chili coconut new leather and cocoa. The palate is viscous with treacle dark berries licorice and more chili. Gingery and drying in the finish with white salt and developing black pepper. (737 bottles) £90"
4891,6,"A 1996 expression is the latest Clynelish to take its place in the Connoisseurs’ Choice lineup. Maturation occurred in refill sherry butts. Fruity on the nose with ripe bananas malt dark toffee lemongrass and a splash of brine. Ultimately a green herbal note. Relatively full-bodied creamy and slightly waxy on the palate; spicy sherry Golden Delicious apples and old leather. The finish is medium to long with lingering ginger. £60"
4892,1,"Pale straw in color and while it is clean and fresh it’s also very delicate with elderflower blossom dusty florals and a freshly-starched linen note. All rather discreet shy even but effort reveals a subtly lovely dram. Water adds a perfumed green note. As the nose suggests it’s not an immediate thruster of a malt with some light jasmine tea and a little fleshy fruit on the end. Tread cautiously lest you scare it."
4893,6,"The third Special Releases cask strength Glenkinchie is the oldest to date and the first to have been matured in European oak casks. Peach and pear soufflé on the initial nose followed by apricots and toffee. The palate is rich and smooth with dark fruits walnuts nutmeg and a hint of resin. Quite lengthy with ginger and white pepper in the aromatic and subtly drying finish. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (5928 bottles)"
4894,9,"When compared to its younger siblings this whisky is deeper in flavor. The citrus becomes more dominant (glazed orange tangerine marmalade) with added notes of caramelized nuts and maple syrup. A good dash of dried spices kicks in and the whisky becomes firm and dry on the finish. My favorite of the standard range is still the 21 year old expression which has been around for quite some time."
4895,6,"Diageo is releasing five triple matured single malts all exclusive to Friends of the Classic Malts and without age statements. Initial maturation was in refill casks followed by a period in charred American oak hogsheads and finally European oak refill casks. Sweet on the nose with heather honey and gingerbread; slightly herbal. Resinous and waxy. Cloves cinnamon oak and black pepper notes on the buttery palate. Medium length in the finish with lingering cloves and freshly-sawn oak. £80"
4896,1,"Mature on the nose mixing the tropical fruits of age with blanched almond. As it opens you encounter Moscato grapes dusted with white pepper. Grows in sweetness. The palate continues this theme with the fruits (blueberry raspberry and pomegranate) typical of the distillery character given a waxy coating by age. Unctuous and good. Water rather pulls the flesh from the bones revealing its age so leave well enough alone. (3756 bottles)"
4897,6,"A portion of the whisky that went into the mix was finished in Caribbean rum casks not the final whisky. The rum barrel finish does shine through. The nose is sweet with cane sugar tropical fruits malt coconut and banoffee pie. Smooth on the palate relatively light-bodied and easygoing with clear rum notes fudge honey cereal and developing bitter orange. Cinnamon and oak char in the relatively short finish. Great for mixing."
4898,1,"Another NAS Laphroaig made from a blend of different cask types. The nose is dry and lightly tarry—a note that continues to the dried glass. There are medicinal phenols a biscuity note then an aroma of fuel like being on a trawler deck. The palate shows integration between the oaks lending a smokehouse aroma. Water lightens but you still get that smoky smear of phenol at the end that tells you this is Laphroaig. Like it."
4899,6,"The longest-standing expression in the range 10 year old was introduced in 2002. It offers a nose that is light and initially green with unripe apples acetate ripe pears bananas and light fudge. The palate is relatively insubstantial with nutty milk chocolate vanilla brittle toffee and oak. Nutty in the short finish with a hint of malt and drying oak."
4900,6,"Sweet on the nose with malt stewed apple apricots sherry and warm spices. Finally caramel. Quite viscous in the mouth; the palate continues the sweet malty spicy theme. Ginger and soft fruits in the medium-length finish. Straightforward and very drinkable. Exclusively available to travelers at World Duty Free Group stores in selected airports throughout the UK and Spain. £46/liter"
4901,9,"A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice I would love to see several single cask cask strength and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

Complex citrus (orange tangerine lime and a hint of lemon) honeyed malt kissed by maple syrup caramelized pineapple cinnamon and a dusting of nutmeg. Nutty toffee on the finish."
4902,1,"The immediate shore-like blast suggests that the sweet amoroso casks haven’t been overly enthusiastic in their embrace. What seems to have happened is that while giving some date and prune they have added an extra layer of oak — giving a charred element — and like Lagavulin hints of tar. The smoke is obscured and the pepper is Javanese. It’s a polite Talisker but the absorption of the smoke means it has lost something integral to its being."
4903,6,"This expression from Springbank Distillery is taking over from its highly regarded 12 year old sibling. It is unpeated distilled three times and matured in bourbon casks. It is non-chill filtered. The nose is gently floral with pears toffee and soft oak then emerging herbal tobacco notes. The palate is full and slightly oily with cream orchard fruits cinnamon and sea salt. The finish is long with vanilla and cocoa powder."
4904,9,"A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice I would love to see several single cask cask strength and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

What you might expect a traditional 100% oloroso sherry cask-aged Springbank to taste like with probably the most familiar flavor profile of the four: rich with nuts and dried fruit chocolate-coated brittle toffee plenty of spice (cinnamon ginger) polished oak hint of tobacco and smoke."
4906,1,"Light amber with that touch of acetone along with marzipan green apple fruit blossom and a runny caramel toffee/crème brûlée which adds width while toasty oak and ginger biscuit give structure and spice. Again a lovely almost oily feel — it’s Dewar’s equivalent of Linkwood — balancing fragrance with surprising depth in the mouth. Water brings the oak into play and tightens the palate. (Travel Retail only) £125"
4907,6,"Independent bottler Gordon & MacPhail offers a variety of Balblair expressions including a 1969 vintage and this 10 year old in their Distillery Labels series. Matured in a mixture of refill sherry hogsheads and first-fill bourbon barrels. The nose offers rich warm fruits vanilla sherry maraschino cherries and ultimately toffee and orange blossom. Medium-bodied sweet and fruity with nutty milk chocolate white pepper and zesty spice. Slowly drying in the finish with licorice and light oak."
4908,6,"This Clynelish was matured in a refill hogshead and has been released as part of Wemyss Malts’ Single Cask Releases series. The nose yields light caramel ozone warm tweed and soft ginger. Smooth and supple on the palate; soft spices tangerines and subtle spicy oak. Chili notes on the relatively long finish. (341 bottles) £85"
4909,6,"This expression includes young heavily-peated Bunnahabhain matured in bourbon barrels mixed with 20 to 21 year old spirit aged in sherry butts. Fragrant peppery peat on the early nose brine and fabric Band-Aids. Ultimately leathery orange. Smooth and supple on the palate with intense smoky fresh fruit giving way to quite dry spices. The relatively long finish yields drying peat plain chocolate and developing licorice. £80"
4910,9,"Amber gold color. Rather sweet aroma and flavors of caramel light toffee almonds and vanilla. A background note of fruit (lemon? ripe cherries?) contributes to its complexity. Its body is somewhat rich and chewy. A dryness on the finish keeps the sweetness of the whisky in check."
4911,9,"Full sherry impact but the Springbank character does manage to fight its way through it. Thick sweet notes of toffee and molasses are accentuated by dark raisin golden raisin prune date nut cake and fruit gumdrops. Nutty briny rhum agricole finish. A Springbank for sherry lovers. (From a single cask 591 bottles exclusively for the U.S.)"
4912,6,"The latest batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts includes this 22 year old expression of Glen Scotia matured in a bourbon barrel that provided 304 bottles. The nose offers soft spices orchard fruits and a faint hint of ozone. Richly fruity on the palate with mandarin oranges vanilla and a sprinkling of sea salt. The finish is gingery and warming with light smoke aniseed and plain chocolate at the close. £100"
4913,1,"Identifiably Caol Ila with that light juniper note lime and very calm smoke. This sense of control continues as it opens very slowly into vanilla/cream with a little hint of salt then fresh lychee. It is hot so do water as this introduces a massively salty retro-nasal effect under which is this sweetly gentle mid-palate. Lovely balance."
4914,6,"This rested in bourbon barrels for almost 18 years until May 2013 when it was transferred to oloroso sherry hogsheads for a prolonged period of finishing. Big waxy warm leather notes on the nose then dried fruit and machine oil. The palate is smooth with cinnamon cloves sherry-soaked raisins and dates. Spicy leather plain chocolate and slightly tannic oak in the very lengthy finish (1800 bottles) £100"
4915,9,"Port Ellen whiskies are getting pretty rare (and expensive). This one is softer and less vibrant than others that I’ve tasted but still very much Port Ellen and still enjoyable! Notes of coal tar rooty licorice toffee dark chocolate and nougat with background citrus gumdrops ginger brine seaweed peat bog and damp oak. I think bottling this at 46% without chill-filtering or perhaps even cask-strength would have helped the flavors “zing"" (and elevated my rating)."
4916,6,"Duncan Taylor’s latest cask strength single cask release from the Sutherland distillery of Clynelish is 21 years old. It is sweet on the nose with hand-rolling tobacco milk chocolate overripe grapes and vanilla. Becoming saltier and drier. Nutty and mildly maritime on the palate with lots of spice steadily drying. Spice and ginger in the lengthy oily finish. £80"
4917,1,"I always think that having “dull” in the middle of its name doesn’t do this distillery any favors. This is anything but; instead this is a fresh and vibrant example that brings on a Whitmanesque reverie of chewing on leaves of grass: sappy fresh chlorophyll coumarin lime. These scented grasses—now vetiver—remain in charge on the tongue. A rolling prairie in the mouth and best neat."
4918,1,"Here is Auchroisk at its more lifted and clean. A whiff of cooking lentils (a lovely smell) alongside lime and cottage cheese (again nice) it gives the impression of a healthy salad. The palate is sweet and quite buttery with minimal attention from oak; instead it’s all very spring-like with good mid-palate sweetness. Water dries it slightly but also extends the palate. Quite lovely."
4919,1,"Here a new solera vat is home to a Glenfiddich that has been exclusively aged in sherry casks and shows its origins with deep black fruitiness orange peel and sultana. The signature pears of ’Fiddich
here are dried and sit next to moist fruitcake. Ripe and long with toffee a pleasant wisp of sulfur and blackberry. An easy-going sherried style that’s ideal for the beginner. (Travel Retail exclusive.) £49/1 liter"
4920,9,"Well-rounded and pleasingly sweet with ripe red strawberries raspberry tropical fruit graham cracker white chocolate and anise all on a bed of toffee. Some charred oak on the finish. This whisky has a gentle soothing persona which I think most people will enjoy (me included)."
4921,6,"This veteran Old Malt Cask offering was distilled in Glen Mhor Inverness during 1982. The early nose is very fruity with Jelly Babies then icing sugar and almonds come through accompanied by supple malt. A good mouthfeel with the fruitiness following on from the nose joined by spicy toffee a wisp of wood smoke and old oak. The finish is medium to long slightly resinous and citric with a dash of cocoa and a hint of peat.  £115"
4922,1,"Another from Glenfiddich’s three new solera vats here we can see the distillery’s light character turned up to the max thanks to a mix of American oak red wine casks and a smidgen of sherry. Think of hyacinth ultra-fresh William pear light barley and grass. Zesty clean and light and ridiculously drinkable with a silky feel in the middle of the tongue. Quite a bargain. (Travel Retail exclusive.) £39/1 liter"
4923,6,"Glengoyne’s core range has been revamped: the 12 year old cask strength bottling was replaced by one with no age statement and this 15 year old was added. Maturation has taken place in sherry casks and the result is a nose of vanilla ginger toffee vintage cars’ leather seats and sweet fruit notes. The somewhat oily palate features quite lively spices raisins hazelnuts and oak. The finish is medium in length and spicy to the end with cocoa powder. £48"
4924,6,"Distilled in 1996 and bottled in June 2015 after maturing in sherry casks this Cooper’s Choice expression of Ben Nevis yields an initially savory character with ripe figs treacle and a hint of tar. Quite chewy in the mouth with spicy toffee and cherries which develop into more citric fruit over time. The finish is lengthy and warming with a hint of oak and black coffee."
4925,6,"The first peated GlenDronach release matured in bourbon barrels before a period in oloroso and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks. The nose offers dry earthy peat then becomes quite perfumed with vanilla and lime. Light to medium-bodied with sweeter peat notes on the palate. Creamy with honey cinnamon sticks and green apples. The finish is medium in length with peat slowly fading and a flaring of spices near the close."
4926,6,"Tomatin has released a limited edition (5400) pack comprising two 350ml bottles each containing a vatting of whisky distilled in 1973 1977 1988 1991 2002 and 2006. One was matured in bourbon barrels (see below); this one in sherry casks. Initially savory on the nose then warm leather sherry and glacé cherries. Very smooth on the palate with soft spices which increase in intensity. Black treacle and Seville oranges. Peppery treacle and old oak in the finish. £100"
4927,6,"Dunnet Head replaces Duncansby Head and consists of 80 percent sherry cask-matured whisky and 20 percent aged in bourbon wood. It is non-chill filtered. Soft caramel on the nose plus a hint of fresh ginger and meadow hay. Sweet spicy sherry and a heathery note on the nicely textured palate with suggestions of citrus and salt. Medium in length with lingering soft spices in the finish; ginger and cinnamon at the close. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
4928,6,"This is the third in a trilogy of limited releases from Tomatin featuring the different cask types used to mature components of the standard lightly peated Cù Bòcan variant. It follows Sherry Edition and Virgin Oak expressions. Initially crisp green apples on the nose then developing vanilla and caramel. Sweet smoky apple and cinnamon. Soft and sweet on the early palate with quite dry smoke evolving along with dark spices. Licorice and aniseed in the finish with a citric tang. £50"
4929,6,"Auchentoshan has launched a range of travel retail-exclusive bottlings with names relating to oak including Heartwood which is matured in a mix of deeply-charred former bourbon and toasted oloroso sherry casks. Soft medium sherry notes on the nose; stem ginger cinnamon parma violets and clove-studded oranges. The palate features wood polish old leather plain chocolate cloves and ginger. Dates and spicy orange marmalade on the lengthy finish. €50"
4930,6,"This expression of Auchentoshan from Douglas Laing’s Provenance range was distilled in September 2000 matured in bourbon casks and bottled in November 2012. Opens very sweet on the nose with vanilla peaches and apricots plus allspice. More caramel in time. Medium bodied with sweet fruits new-mown hay and hard toffee on the palate giving way to spice and aniseed. The spicy finish features cloves and dries steadily with a final flourish of pepper. £40"
4931,1,"Rich gold. Here we have a good example of Bunna’ in full ‘welcome home to a warm house after a cold walk’ mode. Warm sweet steamy with a light mineral note dried fruit walnut and that giveaway gingerbread signature. The palate is clean spicy and drier than the nose suggests but has a soft center. A lovely dram for a chill summer evening. £75"
4932,6,"Samsara is a combination of 8 to 10 year old whiskies matured in first-fill bourbon barrels and California red wine hogsheads bottled non-chill filtered. Initially slightly savory on the nose then peaches and cream and soft spices. The palate is supple and sweet with vanilla mango and passion fruit. The finish is long with spicy pears. Drier spices emerge and ultimately light tannins. The red wine influence is greatly enhanced by the addition of a few drops of water. £60"
4933,9,"Antique gold color. Rich thick malty aroma with interwoven notes of fruit anise and polished oak. Medium to full in body and rich in texture and flavor with chewy toffee roasted nuts vanilla fudge and candied fruit. Soothing finish with a gentle sweetness balanced by a soft leathery dryness."
4934,6,"The first batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts in 2015 includes this 1999 bottling from Aberfeldy. The hogshead yielded 379 bottles. The nose opens with overripe bananas followed by peaches gingerbread treacle subtle smokiness and vanilla custard. The whisky really earns its sobriquet with a waxy mouthfeel and a little more smoke ripe eating apples and ginger on the palate. The spicy finish dries slowly to plain chocolate and aniseed. £88"
4935,6,"The oldest bottling in Wemyss Malts’ March 2015 batch of six releases Foraged Fruit Fool was aged in a bourbon barrel. Orchard fruits double cream vanilla and ginger on the enticing nose. The palate is initially sweet and fruity supple becoming nuttier with gentle spices. The finish is quite lengthy with fruit bonbons allspice and prickly oak. (330 bottles) £120"
4936,6,"As part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its Scotch whisky distilleries Bacardi subsidiary John Dewar & Sons has now released a trio of bottlings from Royal Brackla situated near Nairn in the Scottish Highlands. The 12 16 and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets Including the UK U.S. and Canada.
The nose offers warm spices walnuts malt peaches in cream honey vanilla and a slightly herbal earthy note. Quite robust on the palate for its strength with spice sweet sherry and mildly smoky orchard fruit. The finish is relatively long with cocoa powder citrus fruit and ginger."
4937,1,"The ruby color gives the port maturation away as does the nose: all plum crumble stewed rhubarb and caramelized orchard fruits. It’s more autumnal than jammy with hints of dusty angelica and only vestigial smoke. The palate is hot with those hedgerow fruits and a light touch of perfumed lavender before a flock of tarry smoke appears on the finish. All well-integrated and at its best with a little water."
4938,9,"Less appetizing brine and zing and showing more “weight” when compared to its sibling. Sweeter notes of toffee fig and vanilla fudge lay the foundation for mixed nuts black raspberry plum nectarine and ripe red grape. A soothing dram."
4939,1,"This has good breadth and hints of honey-nut cornflakes on the nose with the distillery’s sweet lemon-fresh/floral core still evident but skewed more toward roasted notes like toasted rice and sun-dried grasses; even a hint of the felt-festooned interior of a woolen mill. Water brings out meadowsweet. Raspberries lead on the palate contrasting with the crisp nutty chaff notes. It’s citric and gingery on the finish but has drive and energy. £42"
4940,6,"This expression of Aberfeldy fits between the core 12 and 21 year old bottlings but is exclusively available in Travel Retail outlets. The nose opens with a slightly savory note rich and spicy with sherry Jaffa oranges and sweet oak. The palate is smooth and rounded with malt nutty spice honey and milky coffee. The finish is lengthy with Seville oranges plain chocolate dark sherry notes and licorice. (Travel Retail only) Price is per liter."
4941,7,"This cask strength whisky is malty in the nose along with peach nectarine and subtle oak. The entry is all malt the kind of flavor that evokes ""malt reverence."" In the mid-palate it’s cereal grains spiced with allspice and black pepper. The finish is long and slightly salty with a fair amount of heat from the alcohol and a touch of oak. If you love the singular flavor of malt this one may be for you. (U.S. only)"
4942,6,"Cask # 1013 from Edradour was filled on March 5th 2002 and bottled on February 26th 2014 at 11 years of age. It has not been chill filtered and is offered at natural color. The nose yields sultanas cloves and sherry plus an earthy aroma and a hint of machine oil. The palate is silky with sweet sherry digestive biscuits soft spices dates and figs. The finish is medium and fruity with dark chocolate-covered candy. £42"
4943,6,"This bottling from Douglas Laing was distilled in January 2008 matured in a refill hogshead and bottled in October 2018. Floral notes on the nose with barley vanilla soft spice and baked apple. Full-on orchard fruits and more barley on the palate. Soft and sweet. The finish dries becoming slightly earthy and tannic with black pepper. (371 bottles)"
4944,6,"Heather honey malt newly-cut hay pineapple and very slight smoke on the nose. Leather malt cinnamon a touch of oak and soft smokiness on the palate. Medium in length with a hint of honey behind the oak spice and smoke. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €150"
4945,6,"Mashy peat notes on the early nose then sherry vanilla and white pepper. Mouth-coating with new leather and sweet spices on the palate. Gentle smokiness and black coffee gradually come to the fore. The finish is medium in length with sweet nutty peat which gradually dries."
4946,6,"Earthy on the early nose with a brief whiff of boiled cabbage and contrasting hints of violet. Ripe apples and pears on the relatively full palate with toffee honey and a background earthiness. The finish is medium in length herbal with ginger and bog oak. (308 bottles)"
4947,6,"Initially drier on the nose than the Fino expression then caramel appears along with milk chocolate and vanilla. More pronounced leathery notes than the Fino; fuller bodied and fruitier on the palate with the fruit developing a salty tang. Lingering salty fruit and spices in the finish with final dark chocolate."
4948,6,"Full sherry and old leather on the nose. Dried fruits and finally a hint of meat extract. Rich sweet and sherried on the palate with nutty spices. Medium to long in the spicy finish with black currant and raisin notes."
4949,6,"This single cask bottling was distilled in February 1993 and matured for 20 years in a sherry butt. Rich and spicy on the nose: peel dates and sultanas. More floral in time. A silky mouthfeel major spice notes ginger and sweet sherry. Long in the finish with nutmeg and plain chocolate cherry liqueur.£80"
4950,6,"The nose gives off gentle sea breezes earthy and nutty aromas then cocoa powder. Pineapple toffee and milk chocolate on the palate with a suggestion of brine. Nutty in the finish with white pepper and lingering lemon. (367 bottles)"
4951,9,"A peated version of Benriach that was also finished in a port pipe. There is a really nice blend of flavors here; a sweet malty foundation layered with ripe red fruit notes (raspberry strawberry preserve currant) and a firm blanket of smoke that goes on and on. All the flavors are bold but they're equally balanced. Not a subtle whisky but quite entertaining. (Binny's Beverage Depot exclusive)"
4952,12,"A sweet and clean nose with aromas of confectioners’ sugar meringue vanilla and almond flour. The balanced palate has richer layers of oak blueberry jam red berries candied ginger and chocolate leading into a quick but pleasant finish with a hint of spice. (Total Wine & More)"
4953,12,"Earthy and a bit saline on the nose like a pine forest in spitting distance of the sea. The palate shows a bit of youthful heat as well as grilled fruit polished oak walnuts and a somewhat soapy character. The finish is nutty and chocolaty with structured oak. (Total Wine & More)"
4954,6,"This single sherry cask bottling from Arran was distilled on February 17th 1997 being bottled on February 5th 2014. The nose opens with a hint of malt vinegar followed by sherry and sultanas. More floral with time. Full-bodied with spicy sherry figs and raisins. Long and spicy in the finish with fruity sherry to the end. (U.S. only)"
4955,9,"Dark and complex. Sweet notes of toffee and caramel are spiced with notes of cinnamon and cocoa. Background notes of smoldering peat oak resin and clove add intrigue and balance the sweetness. Long resinous dried spice finish. (Bottled for Sam’s Wines and Spirits)"
4956,9,"A lush Highland Park aged in a sherry cask. Ripe fruit (sultana apricot dark cherry pits) layers of sweetness (toffee nougat molasses) almonds and juicy oak. Hints of vanilla cream honey heather and polished leather add dimension. This sherry contribution is clean not overly sappy or waxy like others I have tasted. (Bottled exclusively for Binny's Beverage Depot.)"
4957,9,"Well-rounded and pleasingly sweet with ripe strawberry raspberry tropical fruit graham cracker white chocolate and anise all on a bed of toffee.  Some charred oak on the finish.  This whisky has a gentle soothing persona which I think most people will enjoy (me included)."
4958,1,"The dark color shouts “sherried!” and the nose confirms. After an initial blast of marzipan there’s rosin stewed Assam tea some licorice hard treacle toffee truffle and a charred element all backed with an earthy undertow. The palate is tight and quite hot with charred red pepper and a bosky wooded note. Not a great fan of water — this is about that deep fungal stuff — there’s an uplift of sweet dark fruits at the end offering balance. £105"
4959,9,"It always amazes me how well this triple-distilled Lowland whisky ages. The best ones are in their twenties and thirties. This one at 40 is still holding up quite well all things considered. Lively fragrant aroma for such an old whisky. Notes of vanilla coconut cream pie butterscotch hay wood shavings sultana dried citrus and a potpourri of spice. Some “old oak” notes emerging from time to time throughout with a gently spicy finish. An expensive whisky but those who pony up the money will enjoy it."
4960,1,"Young it certainly is. Precocious even and a pallid-looking youth on first impression but behind that bland exterior is freshness and life with a fragrance that is very un-Balmenach all chilled Muscat grapes melon even some cucumber. This general perfumed zinginess continues on the tongue though the weight of the distillate (Balmenach has worm tubs) anchors it well. It’s not about age — it’s about character. Enjoy."
4961,9,"A coastal Speysider and this is evident in many of the Inchgower bottlings including this one. This is quite a fruity dram with notes of tangerine lemon and kiwi. Soft vanilla coconut and honey play in the mix with a lingering salty/seaweed tang on the palate for intrigue. Very clean light and surprisingly reserved in oak notes considering its age."
4962,9,"Technically a Speyside whisky but it tastes more like a coastal Northern Highlander. The foundation of this whisky is a lovely honeyed maltiness. It is aged in a sherry cask which provides layers of rich toffee caramel and orange marmalade. Brisk sea salt notes emerge on the palate keeping the whisky fresh and quite lively-the coastal influence-while deft seaweed and spice add complexity."
4963,9,"Antique gold. Gentle aromas of oak caramel and a hint of vanilla and sea breeze. Light-medium body with a creamy texture. Soft gentle flavors of vanilla toffee subtle fruit and brine with a dryish oaky finish."
4964,9,"Amber gold color. Medium bodied and slightly oily. Peaty bonfire aroma and flavors complemented by a creamy caramel maltiness. Subtle notes of brine seaweed and a hint of pear fruit spice things up a bit. Gently dry moderately smoky finish with teasing sea salt notes. I have always wondered what a peat smoke infused Isle of Jura whisky would taste like. I was also concerned that too much peat smoke could dominate this whisky's flavor profile. Fortunately this hasn't happened. The peat smoke is certainly evident but the Jura character comes through too. One extra bonus: it's bottled at 45% which kicks the flavors up a notch."
4965,10,"Few single malt whiskies from the Speyside Distillery make it to the U.S. This noses like a gammon joint glazed with sliced orange and a side order of sugar mice. Hesitantly a sip brings relief with dark chocolate stewed rhubarb strained raspberry juices walnut and burnt bakery goods. Dry finish with remnants of cocoa. Worth experimenting with water as lovely candied peel and golden syrup notes peek out."
4966,4,"The variety between this series of single casks is quite extraordinary. This has a soft and light nose with some mint and liqueured fruit and a big rich and impressive taste with anise and menthol glacé cherries and traces of mint. The finish is warming and full with the mint and cherry theme carrying through to a slightly peppery conclusion. £71"
4967,9,"Fresh briny and very appetizing. Mouth-coating vanilla lightly toasted marshmallow and a kiss of honey add a soothing balance while pineapple nectarine gentle spice and subtle seaweed offer intrigue. Old Pulteney has great potential if only given the opportunity. Bottling at cask strength and not chill-filtered really brings out more of the whisky’s subtle complexities. I welcome more single cask cask-strength Pulteneys in the future. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
4968,9,"Fresh and clean with notes of vanilla ripe barley honey caramel apple and toasted coconut. Creamy and mouth-coating in texture leading to a pleasingly dry spicy oak finish. Very drinkable yet satisfying. Quite nice."
4969,6,"Distiller’s Gold is exclusive to Travel Retail outlets and is dedicated to the distillery’s first manager Cochran Cartwright whose ghost is said to haunt the Stirlingshire distillery. Distiller’s Gold displays a nose of brittle nut toffee and dried fruit with vanilla and caramel notes emerging. Spicy tropical fruits on the palate with an edge of cinnamon and ginger. Medium in length pleasantly oaky persistently nutty and spicy. Price is per liter."
4970,6,"The latest Tullibardine vintage release to hit the States is another example of whisky distilled in 1993 but now bottled at 18 years of age. The initial nose features cut grass and sliced melon with freshly-peeled tree bark. Intensifying sweetness with time. Quite rich and full on the palate with cereal soft fudge and mild ginger. The finish is medium in length insistently spicy with oak and vanilla notes."
4971,1,"This time we’ve got Macallan in savory mode even a little balsamic. The spirit shows its hand more than in the 1995 with typical Macallan heft. Now you are deep in a forest of yew and larch with a dark chocolate bar for sustenance. Maturity has brought out leather alongside clove and resin. The palate shows a similar tomato note seen in the 1995 cask with positive bitterness and wedding cake. Though grippy it has great balance. 285 bottles."
4972,1,"The world’s best-selling single malt. Isn’t that sufficient to give this dram some respect? It might be me but it strikes me that ’Fiddich has more heft to it these days with a sherried element giving the pear apple and light cereal of the distillery character a sweet plump sultana underpinning. This then adds chewiness to the palate balancing the dry nuttiness and receding on the finish where those green fruits come through to add fresh acidity. Great balance."
4973,9,"Antique gold. Aromas of toffee malty sweetness fresh mint and subtle oak. Mouth coating creamy texture-almost chewy-with flavors of toffee almonds dark chocolate and subtle wood spices on the finish. This is a very pleasing straightforward whisky that is quite mature for its age."
4974,1,"A very immediate expressive sweet start with manuka honey dribbling on top of baked fruits sweet citrus and a dollop of clotted cream on the side. All very luscious and calorific. As if this dessert theme wasn’t sufficient the palate lays it on even more thickly with apricot now joining the mass of fruits. The light grip adds very necessary structure and stops things getting floppy. One for those with a sweet tooth. Recommended.(U.S. only)"
4975,9,"Finished in a tawny port cask. Peat smoke and seaweed interwoven with layers of ripe red fruit (currant raspberry cherry) crisp citrus graham cracker vanilla and honey. Nice interplay between sweetness fruit and smoke. (Brighter and more dimensional than the other two reviewed here.)"
4976,9,"Benriach is a lesser-known whisky and for a Speysider fairly light in style. This one is very bright and fruity on the nose with aromas of citrus (lemon) pineapple green grapes vanilla bean honey and linseed oil. Its age is evident but tucked away in the background. The palate mirrors the aromas and is quite complex. As you might expect for a 34 year old whisky it dries out mid-palate with some grassy hay notes yielding to resinous oak towards the finish but the oak never becomes excessive. I can’t remember the last time I tasted a Benriach this good."
4977,6,"Harald Fairhair was King of Norway and a major figure in Viking history. This Warrior variant takes us closer to Highland Park’s traditional DNA with the nose offering potato peels on a barbecue; earthy and herbal with developing notes of heather in bloom and even violets. Lively fresh fruits newly-baked cake nutmeg and ginger figure on the palate. The spicy finish is relatively long with candied citrus peel and licorice. €75/700 ml"
4978,6,"Previously only available as part of Diageo’s annual Special Releases program and now bottled at the classic Talisker strength of 45.8% instead of cask strength. Initially salty then sweet and spicy on the nose with summer berries heather honey and an earthy note plus subtle peat. Spicy and drying on the slightly waxy palate with licorice aniseed and prominent peat embers. The finish is medium in length peppery and relatively tannic. £225"
5199,9,"Pale gold color. Aromatic floral herbal aromas (a veritable potpourri) with soft background vanilla malt notes and a hint of lemon. Light and soft in body. Soft malty vanilla notes on the palate with interwoven notes of herbs subtle dried fruit and delicate wood resins. Gently dry finish."
4979,9,"I’ve known Loch Lomond has been making some peated expressions and it’s nice to finally see (and taste) some product being bottled with this whisky and its sibling Croftengea reviewed below. This is my choice of the two with greater (and more richly textured) flavors to accompany the peat. The smoke is balanced (and tamed) nicely by sweet notes of creamy vanilla honey gristy malt hay and subtle fruit and spice. The finish remains balanced and lingers with a smoky lightly salty tang. Fresh and youthful yet still nicely matured at 13 years old and a nice alternative to smoky Islay whiskies."
4980,6,"The latest release from Tomatin distillery is a limited edition (3150 bottles) 15 year old that has been matured in a combination of second-fill bourbon barrels and tempranillo wine casks (the grape of full-bodied Spanish reds like those from Rioja). The nose offers fruit cocktail and salted popcorn while milk chocolate vanilla and nutty caramel notes emerge. Soft chocolate bananas and autumn berries on the slightly peppery palate. The finish is nutty with lingering spice peppery oak and finally a lengthy creamy sensation."
4981,6,"Elgin distiller bottler and whisky merchant Gordon & MacPhail has revamped its prestigious Rare Old range of veteran single malts many from lost distilleries and this bottling from Glenugie in Peterhead is one of the latest releases in the lineup. Sweet on the nose with marshmallows wax polish creamy caramel and milk chocolate. Quite full-bodied with white pepper ginger muted citrus fruit and cocoa. Soon starts to dry…drying steadily through the nutty finish with musty oak and aniseed. £430"
4982,9,"The fifth peated release of Edradour. This one is aged in Marsala casks. Sweet with clinging fruit and thumping raw smoke. Youthful embracing and fleshy in the middle with ash anise and espresso that grow toward the finish. These Ballechin releases keep getting better. Reminds me of a young Islay whisky without the brine and seaweed."
4983,6,"This 20 year old expression of Tullibardine has been aged in first-fill bourbon barrels like its younger stablemate Sovereign. Caramel honey cocoa and a hint of linseed oil on the nose. The palate is creamy with strawberries warm milk chocolate and allspice. Long and soft in the finish which is reminiscent of choc-ice. At 20 this single malt has gained in richness and sophistication with an extremely enticing flavor profile."
4984,9,"A big and sappy Longmorn with notes of chewy toffee juicy oak candied fruit sandalwood citrus and even some distant smoke. The standard distillery issue of Longmorn 15 year old itself is a big whisky-one of the biggest in Speyside with its rich malty foundation-but this expression kicks it up a notch. Aging 31 years in a sherry butt injects this whisky with a lot more sherry character along with those woody citrus spicy notes found in so many older whiskies. While not as clean as the distillery issue and its maltiness is somewhat masked there’s a lot going on here to entertain the palate. And although one could argue that the sherry is a bit extreme the equally extreme dry spicy oak notes provide ample contrast."
4985,6,"The most youthful bottling in the Constellation series is a 19 year old which started life in a first-fill bourbon barrel before being transferred into a European oak port pipe in 2002 for a further nine years of maturation. The nose offers a hint of new leather marzipan developing caramel and damsons. Zesty fruit allspice and ground ginger on the palate along with thick-cut orange marmalade. The finish is long warming and spicy. Cask number 18; 737 bottles."
4986,1,"This was a true double maturation: a dozen years in first-fill bourbon and then 13 years in claret. In its 20s Bowmore tends to shed its smoke and allows the soft fruits (here persimmon nectarine) which have always been there to show themselves. There’s a light oiliness on the tongue. The casks have added vanilla red fruits and spice but the overall impression is of harmony and integration. Lovely. (200 bottles) £350"
4987,1,"The official Fèis Ìle  2016 bottling. This is a mix of bourbon and wine casks given a period in virgin oak. The finish initially adds a certain sauna-like element but then the distillery’s lemon drops and flowers come through alongside baked apples coconut and a touch of smoke. The alcohol burn is negligible allowing more estery elements melon and red fruits to come through. A classic Laddie in other words. (1881 bottles) £95"
4988,1,"The color is light gold the nose is very sweet and delicate with a floral aspect that’s not always immediately apparent in Glenfarclas. This is from a fourth-fill hogshead which provides creaminess toffee a little hint of orchid burnt cream and grilled peach. Sweetly delicious. The palate is akin to bread-and-butter pudding with that creaminess continuing. All very summery and ‘up.’ Quite different but appealing. £350"
4989,9,"Stylish sophisticated. Fresh honeyed floral green grapes kiwi plum and currant jelly. Hint of cinnamon and nutmeg. Soft gently sweet finish. Pleasing sweetness to go with the fruit."
4990,1,"Delicate with some jasmine lily of the valley and even with time the rich aldehydes of Chanel No.5. This heaviness gives a butterscotch-like quality when water’s added alongside apple. The palate is thicker than the light color suggests—it’s from a fourth-fill hogshead—with overripe pear and white chocolate; with water becomes scented with an added touch of marzipan and chestnut puree. One for a thoughtful afternoon’s contemplation. £760"
4991,1,"Lightly grassy and hay-like with some wheat chaff. The nose is quite hot but that cereal note (reminiscent of draff) is pleasing sitting alongside clean apple and orange barley water. The palate is sweeter and more floral (pear blossom) compared to the nose though retaining some nuttiness. Has good verve. When diluted the finish shows real chocolate and some dry spice. A very interesting young ‘un. £54"
4992,1,"I used to find this a little lacking in structure. Either I’ve changed my palate (or was always wrong) or the solera’s slow changes have added depth and complexity. The nose is all cooked plums with some blueberry stewing rhubarb. All is delicately scented with some currant leaf then sultana and sweet dried fruits. The palate is equally fruity—more hedgerow fruits now—but there’s grip and a little fresh acidity to balance. Hugely appealing and approachable."
4993,7,"A rare bottling from a distillery that is more commonly released as a part of whisky blends. Light fruit and sweet malt define the nose with apple apricot and honey. The entry is bursting with flavor centered around malt along with honey salt and apricot. The mid-palate adds a touch of oak smoke and spice and is extremely well integrated and balanced. A medium-length finish ends abruptly and a little too dry the only left turn in an otherwise superb whisky. (Julio’s Liquors only)"
4994,6,"This expression was aged in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. A savory opening to the nose followed by figs dipped in lemon juice. Sweet spicy cream sherry on the palate Christmas cake flavors then black pepper and tannins develop. The finish is medium to long with honey and malt. Accomplished but expensive for its age."
4995,1,"Matured in cognac before being finished in Sauternes; here we have a clean sweet and well-rounded Bunna’ with hickory-like smoke bonfire and ginger biscuits. Lightly vegetal notes with farmyard elements among the smoke and thick citric sweetness. Immediate smoke on top of this mix of spice Seville orange apricot cheesecake base hazelnut red fruits and preserved ginger in syrup adding an almost peppery finish. Lovely. £250"
4996,6,"A 27 year old offering from Glenturret in Perthshire this bottling is from a refill hogshead that was filled in December 1988. Fresh mango and ripe peaches on the early nose followed by a slightly smoky earthy note. Viscous on the palate with orchard fruit notes coconut caramel and nutmeg. Drying in the finish with mildly tannic oak black pepper and a final flourish of citrus. (264 bottles) £110"
4997,6,"Speyburn’s entry level NAS single malt takes its name from the Gaelic term for “golden salmon” and was matured in bourbon casks. The nose is light and youthful with malt vanilla and unripe apples while the palate offers more malt and vanilla plus dry spicy oak. The finish is medium in length and grassy with ginger and further dry oak."
4998,9,"An intriguing whisky. Blueberry cobbler crushed grape maple syrup nougat and spice (cinnamon nutmeg). The oak is polished and unimposing. Liqueur-ish. A nice contrast to its younger sibling and it’s more polarizing because of its distinctiveness."
4999,6,"Distilled in September 1995 and after 20 years maturing in a refill hogshead this Aberdeenshire single malt was bottled in February 2016. The nose is soft with ginger lots of floral notes cinnamon and vanilla. Sweet and malty on the mature palate with banana honey milk chocolate and cocoa plus big cinnamon and nutmeg spice notes. Drying in the finish with a drizzle of lemon juice and then black pepper. (254 bottles) £80"
5000,6,"From Wemyss Malts’ Midsummer Single Cask Releases this bottling from Blair Athol was distilled in 1991 and bottled in 2015. Soft sweet fruits as the nose opens—principally juicy pears. This is backed up by malt and cinnamon. Very smooth and inviting on the palate with honey brittle toffee gentle spices darker malt and walnuts. Slightly mouth-drying in the finish with cocoa powder and lingering spice. (312 bottles) £115"
5001,9,"Finished (or ACE’d -- additional cask enhanced -- as they say) in a Madeira cask. Soft in texture and deceivingly seductive in nature. Pleasingly sweet (honey caramel aromas of sticky toffee pudding) with lush summer fruit and gentle spice notes emerging towards the finish. A soft pleasing Macallan with everything in balance. Nicely done."
5002,1,"Though as pale as ever this Lagavulin is hardly in need of a Charles Atlas course. The nose is ozonic like rock pools at low tide with kelp splattered around. Sweetness comes in the form of cloudy apple juice and a smokehouse kipperiness. The palate is explosive with masses of retronasal action showing violet root thyme juniper tarragon/fennel and a finish akin to smoked cheese. An improvement on the 2012 release."
5003,6,"This 2016 release follows similar port and Madeira quarter cask-matured Kilchomans with sauternes casks being pressed into service this time. The casks in question were sourced from Château d’Yquem and the whisky is 5 years old. Earthy peat a savory note vanilla citrus fruit and sweet wine on the nose while the palate offers smoked haddock tarry rope and bonfire embers. The finish is relatively long with fruity peat. (6000 bottles)"
5004,4,"Visit Springbank’s tasting room and you’ll find distillery-only bottlings of all three whisky styles produced by the Campbeltown distillery. But it’s this malt that will probably attract the most interest. Glengyle was officially re-opened in 2004 and in recent years Springbank has released a work in progress each year. What makes this unusual is the fact that the maturing malt is held in a cask which is kept at least half full and each year it is topped up with malt from 2004 through the solera method. This year then the oldest malt is six years old. The nose definitely suggests a work in progress and is immature rootsy and meaty though some orange and citrus fruit notes are there too. On the palate there’s plenty to be encouraged by with some spearmint and menthol developing fruitiness earthy peat and distinctive salt and spice."
5005,7,"Extreme peat smoke explodes out of the glass. It’s diesely burnt tire smoke more than campfire. Past the peat there's salt paste and honey. On the palate it's another blast of smoke. This nearly chokingly strong smoke dissipates slightly to reveal oyster shells malt paste and honey. Make no mistake the smoke is the star and will remind you of that fact hours after you finish your last sip. An uber-peated whisky that hardcore peatheads will surely adore. (U.S. only)"
5006,6,"This Travel Retail-exclusive from Glenmorangie is the inaugural expression in the distiller’s new Legends series. Glenmorangie Duthac is matured in a mix of charred virgin oak and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. Peaches tangerines cloves vanilla and toffee bonbons on the nose. Silky on the palate with warm spices honey intense tropical fruit and fresh ginger. Relatively long and creamy in the finish with nutmeg marzipan and milk chocolate. Price is per liter."
5007,6,"New in 2016 this is an NAS entry-level bottling for the brand matured in bourbon barrels before spending a finishing period in oloroso sherry butts. Sweet and malty on the nose a hint of mash then pineapple. Becoming more floral with violets. The palate offers soft fruit notes cocoa powder light sherry and mixed nuts. The finish is medium in length with milky coffee and soft spices."
5008,6,"This is the first expression from Glen Garioch to have been fully matured in wine casks specifically tonneaux de vin rouge barriques from Saint-Julien in Bordeaux. The whisky was distilled on June 23rd 1998 and spent over 15 years in the Bordeaux wood. Milk chocolate-coated caramels crystallized ginger and cranberries on the nose. Autumn berries on the early palate turning to cough syrup with rich malt and lively chocolate spiciness. Caramel merges with white pepper in the relatively long finish."
5009,6,"Duncansby Head has been aged in a mixture of bourbon and Spanish sherry casks. The nose is initially slightly earthy; then Old Pulteney’s characteristic marine nature develops discreetly along with icing sugar sprinkled on apple pie and a hint of roasted potato skins. The palate is smooth and chewy with sherry making its presence felt along with cooked apples oranges sultanas nutmeg and cocoa. The finish is spicy and nicely rounded. £45/liter"
5010,6,"This portwood finish from Tomatin was matured for some 13 years in bourbon casks before being transferred for a final period of aging in Portuguese tawny port pipes which had matured port for between 30 and 40 years. Initially reticent on the nose with soft fruit notes honey and toffee turning to cherry cough lozenges. Gently spiced on the nutty palate with peaches and Cherryade. The finish is medium in length and always fruity."
5269,9,"Thick and very tactile. Malty with good heft. Notes of vanilla honey biscuit and caramel custard. A soothing comforting whisky. On the surface not very complex but very satisfying nonetheless."
5011,1,"A light color suggests a relaxed contact between cask and whisky but what this lacks in terms of ‘woodiness‘ it makes up for in all-round deliciousness. Aberlour is often masked with plenty of sherry and/or bourbon oak; here the distillery character is thrust to the fore and comes out as being highly aromatic. There are candies bubblegum kiwi fruits and cut flowers. The palate is vibrant with a touch of parma violet and pear juice. Altogether a little charmer."
5012,6,"The latest Wemyss Malts single cask offering from Clynelish distillery is a 16 year old expression matured in a hogshead which gave an out-turn of 339 bottles. The nose offers sea salt and lemon with emerging green apples and vanilla. Apple tart with custard and a dusting of cinnamon on the palate. The finish is long and peppery with a hint of freshly-ground coffee beans. £75"
5013,6,"Distilled in 1989 this edition of Dalwhinnie is the fifth to appear in this annual line-up and was aged in refill American oak hogsheads. 5196 bottles are available. Pine vanilla and honey on the nose. Sweet on the viscous palate with unripe apples pineapple cinnamon and honey. The finish is medium in length slightly savory with dark chocolate and a hint of sweet oak."
5014,1,"Last year four whisky editors were invited by Glenrothes’ heritage director Ronnie Cox to choose a single cask bottling. Being opinionated hacks they couldn’t agree and so two casks were chosen! This the oldest from a refill butt is for the European markets and shows hints of rancio: truffle leaf mold boot polish and star anise. The impression is of faded elegance with tannins fruit and spice in harmony and a hint of pomegranate-like bitterness just on the end. £600"
5015,6,"Exclusive to the Travel Retail arena this expression of Auchentoshan was aged for 14 years in a mix of bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. It is not chill-filtered prior to bottling. The nose yields polished oak malt milk chocolate marzipan figs apricots and ginger. Rich and full on the palate spicy with vanilla mango and finally Seville oranges. Medium to long in the finish with almonds soft oak and warming spices."
5016,9,"Sweet viscous and weighty; much more so than its sister whisky (reviewed above) that was finished in Madeira casks. But the same Caol Ila DNA is here — tar olive brine pepper — along with fleshy red fruit and chocolate. Lingering ripe fruit and tar on the finish. Save this one for after dinner or with a book at bedtime."
5017,1,"Brought back as an annual limited edition to satisfy the cravings of those who like their peat full-on and never understood why Lagavulin moved to 16 years of age this is the Kildalton coast single malt at its most boisterous. Aromatically it blazes a seaweed-strewn zigzag pathway between sea shore and land: bog myrtle and samphire beach bonfire sea spray and melon before with much-needed water there’s slow-burning Latakia pipe tobacco and Lapsang Souchong tea."
5018,9,"A gentle pleasant dram. Quite floral too. Soft creamy vanilla foundation with a hint of marshmallow. Underlying notes of cut grass and linseed oil add texture and intrigue. Rosebank is a classic Lowlander and given that the distillery closed in 1993 younger expressions will become more difficult to find (not to mention more expensive). Here’s a good whisky at a fair price."
5019,6,"Higher in strength than the standard Glen Scotia 10 year old this heavily peated expression is part of the distillery’s Legends of Scotia series and celebrates Campbeltown's historic Picture House. Just 6000 bottles. Fruity peat on the nose with lots of apricot and peach notes. Finally fresh cigarette ash. Voluptuous in the mouth and fruity then sweet spice and drier peat notes develop. The finish is medium to long with spicy tar. €70"
5020,6,"This single cask variant of Glen Scotia has been matured in a sherry butt for 21 years and the cask yielded 833 bottles. Fruity on the nose with sultanas cherries marzipan and milk chocolate. The palate showcases overripe oranges sherry and plain chocolate with a tang of brine. Drying in the finish with pepper licorice and subtle smoke. £110"
5021,1,"Also distilled in 2009 this is mid-gold in color and medium weight with a mass of sage-like smoke. More cask influence than 7.1 with smoked coconut and again a mix of sweet fruits and lemon behind this smoky lead. Oily and rich but a little fragmented on the tongue; the elements are beginning to cohere to produce integrated complexity. Octomore in mellow mood with smoked chestnut and a little farmyardy Pinot note. Another positive work in progress report. £125"
5022,1,"This is master blender Ian MacMillan’s interpretation of what Bunna’ would have tasted like when the distillery was founded in 1881. There’s light smoke coming across like smoked halibut a mineral edge white fruits and a freshness like a freshly starched shirt. Water brings out almond. On the palate the smoke offers a slightly peppery almost Talisker-esque kick. Light lemon and sweet fruits in the center. Though there’s no age statement none of the whiskies are under 10 years. £46"
5023,12,"Sweet with a touch of saline on the nose: almond cream lemon curd fresh coconut kumquat and vanilla salt water taffy. The palate is soft and velvety with apples and pears toffee a sprinkling of grapefruit and kumquat and a touch of guava. Lingering sweetness on the finish though it fades quickly. Water doesn’t do it any favors; taste this neat."
5024,6,"Lemonade hints of aniseed and putty on the nose. Tropical fruits spice and milk chocolate on the palate. The finish is medium in length and spicy with a hint of licorice."
5025,6,"Nougat and a suggestion of fresh newsprint on the nose. Quite full-bodied with a palate of mixed nuts and peaches in brandy. The finish is slightly waxy with fruit and nut chocolate."
5026,9,"A pleasure to drink just like the 12 year old version that preceded it. A foundation of honeyed malt with background vanilla subtle cocoa faint bourbon salt and diffuse spice on the palate. Light to medium in body but fairly viscous in texture. However a coastal freshness cuts through the viscosity keeping the whisky lively. Some of the freshness of the previous 12 year old distillery bottling is sacrificed in exchange for more depth and fullness. It is neither better nor worse for this just different."
5027,1,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. This is from a first fill American oak hoggie and the extra time in cask has given it a classic mature Glenlivet character: a rich complex mix of cooked apple pine and citrus cut with rose petal. The fruitiness has moved from pear into baked apricot. Water adds an almond note. The scented notes have been retained (especially on the finish) but have deepened into sweet spice. The oak gives light grip. Have with chilled water on the side. £250"
5337,9,"A very fruity “Laddie” flowing with tangerine apricot pineapple and pear. Background notes of honey vanilla and a wisp of smoke. The typical Bruichladdich fresh appetizing brine notes are restrained emerging ever so subtly on the finish. Nicely rounded and clean throughout."
5028,1,"This is usually a bracing expression of Lagavulin and this year’s release doesn’t disappoint—smoldering peat ozone freshness but with greater sweetness than in 2011 though water shows how it is still just a little gawky. The palate is yes smoky but there’s also light cereal praline violets and seashore aromas aplenty. Fills the mouth with intensity. Okay it’s edgy but that’s what you expect."
5029,6,"Named in honor of the copper teapot from which distillery workers were ‘drammed’ until the 1970s this distillery-exclusive bottling has been matured in first-fill oloroso sherry casks for an unspecified period. The nose is fruity and fragrant with profound spicy sherry notes. Mouth-coating with lots more sherry plus prunes drinking chocolate and a little oak. Lingering in the finish with drying sherry light spice and dark chocolate. A great dram for lovers of a true sherry monster! £60"
5030,6,"The name of this limited-edition bottling translates as ‘the lands around the rowan’ and the component whisky has been matured in three fresh-run American white oak hogsheads. Tinned peaches a hint of smoke and developing cream soda on the nose. Soft toffee and ultimately chimney soot. The palate is full and fruity with Brazil nuts drying quite rapidly with coriander notes. Dark chocolate and licorice characterize the finish. (500 bottles). £500"
5031,6,"This 25 year old single cask bottling of Glen Garioch from Wemyss was one of a dozen released in late 2014. The hogshead in which maturation took place yielded 357 bottles. The nose gives apple banana vanilla fudge nutmeg and soft spices. Creamy and nutty on the palate with a squeeze of lemon soft toffee and milk chocolate. The finish is medium in length spicy and nutty with cocoa powder and just a suggestion of smoke. £87"
5032,10,"Ebony colored whisky with dark aromas of dense fruitcake fresh fig Medjool dates sultana and Christmas spices of nutmeg clove and cinnamon though a struck-match note lurks within. The treacle-thick palate has Coca-Cola clove aniseed eucalyptus sultanas leather blackcurrant black cherry dried fig and raisin. The currant-bun finish is tannic and woody; tastebuds flinch and recoil. This is a grizzled old-timer best left to adventurous souls."
5033,6,"Distilled in February 2000 and matured in a single refill hogshead this example of Arran is part of the Provenance range which highlights the season of distillation on the bottle label. Malt salt milk chocolate vanilla and developing citrus notes on the fragrant nose. Quite full in the mouth fruity and zesty with a hint of grist. Long and softly spiced in the finish with almonds and a final suggestion of aniseed. £40"
5034,6,"Distilled in May 1993 this bottling is of the Ledaig heavily-peated variant of Tobermory single malt. Aged for 19 years it was ‘finished’ for 40 months in wine casks from the St-Joseph AOC in northern Rhône. Pickled beetroot emerging caramel and distant log-fire embers on the nose. Voluptuous and fruity notably spicy—pepper and ginger—plus mulled wine notes. Quite lengthy in the finish with lingering spice. Peatiness is most evident here. 2200 bottles."
5035,6,"Unlike ‘house’ bottlings of Highland Park all of which are aged in sherry casks this expression in Douglas Laing’s Old Malt Cask series has been matured in former bourbon wood. It was distilled in September 1996. Sweet and fruity on the nose with nougat and peanut butter plus a slightly herbal note and finally discreet sweet peat smoke. Medium-bodied citric and spicy with a little smoke. Smokiness turns to ash in the finish with citrus fruit and caramel. £70"
5036,9,"Pale in color with a gold/green tinge. Exotic fruit (papaya coconut kiwi) with gentle sweet notes (vanilla honey pancake syrup marshmallow) spiced with fresh appetizing brine and anise. The brine lingers on the finish as do some molasses toffee notes. Dynamic and well-rounded."
5037,9,"An unusual Caol Ila in that it was finished in a rum cask. The rum influence is subtle - which I like - and it offers a new dimension to the whisky without blunting that Caol Ila character we have come to either love or (for some of you) despise. Olives seaweed fire smoke salt and pepper notes are wrapped up nicely in a malty/caramel blanket. Peppery smoky finish that lingers on like the embers of an all-night bonfire."
5038,9,"Aged in a re-charred sherry cask. Moderately rich and sweet on the nose and palate but clean and not heavy. Light toffee nougat Brazil nuts vanilla fudge and honey-laced citrus fruit and golden raisin. Subtle brine accents throughout with a soothing finish. (Bottled for Park Avenue Liquors.)"
5039,9,"Caol Ila enthusiasts will be familiar with the tarry rope seaweed brine and white pepper. All this is underpinned nicely by soft sweeter notes of dark chocolate and vanilla nut truffle. Subtle underlying juniper horehound and mint adds intrigue. Nice oily texture with a pleasing dry finish. Time has tempered this Caol Ila but it has aged gracefully."
5040,9,"There are still some casks of 1960s Springbank surfacing (even if most are from the independent bottlers). This one is a lighter more delicate example of the genre. Exotic notes of tropical fruit citrus vanilla linseed and honey combine with a gentle fresh brine tang and some background dried spice. The flavors are slightly muted but this is not surprising given its age. (A Park Avenue Liquors Exclusive.)"
5041,9,"Light to medium in body (and quite pale in color) but quite invigorating. A flirtatious vanilla sweetness at the front of the palate quickly evolves into spicy peppery grassy notes. The whisky evolves further expressing notes of smoke tar chewy seaweed brine feint green tea and olives. A persistent if delicate honey sweetness hangs on throughout to offer some gentility. Lingering smoky finish. A raw whisky but somehow compelling. An excellent value too! (Bottled exclusively for Binny's Beverage Depot.)"
5042,6,"An attempt to replicate the spirit produced at Ben Nevis in 1882. The malt is peated to around 30 ppm and a first edition of 700 bottles with no age statement has been released. Initial starch on the nose then buttery smoked haddock a hint of chili sherry and gentle wood smoke. Full-bodied spicy on the palate with hazelnuts and peat. Stewed fruit and lingering spicy cigarette ash in the finish. £60"
5043,9,"An interesting contrast to the Signatory bottling reviewed above. While expressing a similar fundamental flavor profile this one is a more polished affair and not as daring. It is fuller in body nicely rounded and expresses a sweeter foundation (less honey more toffee and caramel)."
5044,6,"Isle of Arran Distillers has introduced a second edition of its Orkney Bere expression made with an ancient variety of barley still cultivated in the Orkney Islands and aged in bourbon barrels. It is a cask strength 10 year old variant and 4890 bottles are available. The nose is quite oily with ripe peaches and pineapple cubes plus developing floral notes. Viscous and sweet on the palate with tangerines caramel and rich spices. The finish is lengthy with coconut and milk chocolate-coated caramel."
5045,6,"This Jura expression was distilled in 1984 and matured in bourbon casks for 22 years before a further 6 years in Gonzalez Byass Matusalem sherry butts and 2 years in Amoroso and Apostoles oloroso sherry casks. The nose opens with beef gravy soon followed by prunes cherries dark chocolate and PX sherry. Full-bodied rich and sweet on the palate with lively spices and more cherries and chocolate. Long and fruity in the finish with spicy sherry and licorice. £750"
5046,6,"The Spey Dram is made up of 36 percent whisky matured in ex-oloroso casks and 64 percent from American oak. The nose offers fresh oranges brittle toffee cream and ginger. The nutty palate reveals fresh fruits and is significantly spicier than the other Rivers expressions with ginger and even chili notes. The finish is long and notably spicy with less chocolate than in the three other Rivers variants ending with a touch of treacle. £42 Currently not available in the U.S."
5047,6,"This 12 year old example of Diageo’s Perthshire single malt has been matured in a sherry butt and features milk chocolate malt and digestive biscuits on the nose; becoming fruitier notably with lemon curd. The palate is rich sweet and spicy with barley honey and white grapes. Vanilla and spicy orange marmalade in the medium-length finish. £40"
5048,6,"That Boutique-y Whisky Company is an independent bottler noted for quirky and very contemporary label design. The whiskies carry no age statements. Springbank Batch 2 has an outturn of 450 numbered bottles. Initially overripe pineapples and dry hay on the oily nose cut by a sprinkling of salt. Brittle toffee and finally hand-rolling tobacco. The palate is very fruity; more pineapple plus peach developing peat plenty of spice and more tobacco. The finish is relatively long and slightly herbal. £58"
5049,6,"One of the latest batch of single cask bottlings from Wemyss Malts is a 15 year old Clynelish named ‘Fresh Fruit Sorbet.’ 331 bottles have been released. Tinned pears new-mown hay honey and lemon sherbet on the nose with a hint of machine oil. The palate is smooth and fruity with pears figs and a suggestion of black pepper. The dominant fruitiness continues through the sugary finish with a background prickle of spice. £60"
5050,6,"This is the Lowlander among Wemyss Malts’ dozen single cask releases for the fall of 2014. Maturation took place in a bourbon barrel which yielded 295 bottles. Tinned peaches in syrup caramel mild vanilla and damp tweed on the nose. Medium-bodied and intensely fruity on the palate with apricots raspberries and ginger. Fruit notes linger in the finish with spicy milk chocolate. £70"
5051,6,"This 1998 vintage triple distilled Lowland Auchentoshan has been matured in fino sherry casks which are rarely used for Scotch whisky maturation. The nose presents violets in fresh soil honey spice developing citric fruit notes and almonds. Quite full-bodied fruity and zesty in the mouth. Lengthy in the finish with spice nuts and oak. Becoming dry and gingery at the last."
5052,6,"Online retailer TheWhiskyBarrel.com has released 60 bottles of 21 year old single malt from the now-lost Lowland distillery of Littlemill. Maturation has taken place in a sherry hogshead and cask #35 yielded 306 bottles with the balance being held by whiskybroker.co.uk. The nose is rich and thick with old sherry caramel and cinnamon while the full palate boasts aniseed pipe tobacco and an effervescence that is unusual in a whisky of this age. The finish is lengthy with drying sherry notes."
5053,9,"Thicker and fruitier than the entry level 10 year old with greater mouthfeel and a drier finish. Orchard fruit (especially pear) kiwi lime and creamy vanilla with suggestions of toasted coconut hay and marshmallow. Dry gently spicy finish. A bit more involved than the 10 year old but still with the same DNA. Very pleasant."
5054,6,"Exclusive to the Travel Retail arena Jura Turas-Mara takes its name from the Gaelic for “long journey.” It has been matured in an array of casks sourced from America Spain France and Portugal. Initially green apples on the nose then sweet fruit notes—jelly babies—plus coconut and fudge. A little linseed in the background. Vanilla peaches mango and lively spices on the palate. The finish dries with aniseed balls becoming slightly powdery. €50"
5055,9,"Bright gold/straw color. Lively aroma of honey-drenched fruit (pineapple red currant citrus) with a rich malty foundation. Subtle floral notes in the background. Medium in body but thick almost mouth-coating in texture (a classic Dallas Dhu signature). Clean flavors on the palate-honey interwoven fruit vanilla with a dry ""polished oak"" finish."
5056,6,"Distilled in September 1995 and matured for 17 years in a refill hogshead this bottling of the Aberdeenshire malt Glen Garioch
offers a nose of fresh peaches and vanilla followed by a sprinkling of chili powder and even a suggestion of boiled ham. Voluptuous in the mouth with summer fruits toffee apples and a significant amount of ginger. The finish
dries quite rapidly with fruity spices. £60"
5057,6,"One of the batches of spring 2013 single cask releases from the prolific Wemyss Malts Candied Fruit is a 15 year old Auchentoshan and 294 bottles are available. An aroma of sweet shops vanilla and white pepper on the nose becoming maltier with dates sultanas figs. Apples and pears on the light-ish palate with coconut and ginger. The finish is fruity—spicy
satsumas—and finally drying. £62"
5058,1,"This is quite a saline Bowmore but there is sufficient sliced apple cut flowers and fragrant smoke to give some degree of complexity to the nose. With water you get crisp oak roasted barley a hint of nectarine bison grass and wet reeds. Starting lean in the mouth it darkens slightly into brambles and a dusty smokiness before picking up a citric tang on the finish. Slightly muted but well balanced. £60/500 ml"
5059,1,"Hard not to compare this to the 12 year old as they are of similar strength and character. This is more about the peat bank rather than the shore more eucalyptus than kelp. This pungent earthy note is retained with water alongside some brine. The palate is like carrageen moss pudding with a touch of nutmeg at the end. Plenty there but it all moves very quickly when I want it to linger. That said a solid performer. £47/500 ml"
5060,9,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Deep gold Aroma: Mature. Plenty of oak but it’s clean. Coconut and citrus fruit. Background spices. Palate: Lovely balance and restrained woodiness for such an old whisky-the wood really doesn’t emerge until the end. Citrus and coconut up front wrapped in a blanket of malt becoming dry and spicy but not excessively so. Delicate lingering oak finish."
5061,9,"Aged initially in a refill sherry cask and then in port casks. Layers of lush fruit (red raspberry strawberry currant rhubarb and ripe peach) with underlying toffee and pot still rum adding body and texture. Peat and brine peek through intermittently particularly on the finish. The whisky is heavy on the fruit but it is clean and not cloying. A very soothing whisky."
5062,9,"Matured in a bourbon cask. Thick and creamy with mouth-coating vanilla ripe barley toasted marshmallow vanilla wafer key lime pie golden delicious apple lemongrass and hay. The vanilla sweetness lingers to the finish mixing with dried herbs and hay. I was expecting more from a carefully chosen Mortlach given its pedigree but this is still nice. (240 bottles) £250"
5063,9,"Glenisla was an experiment by the parent company-who only owned Speyside distilleries-to produce a smoky ""Islay-style"" whisky at Glen Keith. It is quite smoky but without the coastal characteristics (brine seaweed). Instead it displays notes of ripe barley ginger lemon peel and licorice stick along with all that peat smoke. A rather straight-forward uncomplicated yet very pleasant smoky whisky. If only all the Speyside distilleries did this 30 years ago."
5064,6,"This veteran Lowland Inverleven — distilled within the now decommissioned Dumbarton grain distillery complex — is a recent addition to Chivas Brothers’ Cask Strength Edition series and is exclusively available at distillery visitor centers and from www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com. The nose is creamy gentle and sweet with vanilla rum raisin ice cream and a subtle contrasting peppery note. Mouth-coating with citrus fruits and slowly developing dark chocolate which lingers through the long and gingery finish. (500 bottles). Currently not available in the U.S. £275"
5065,9,"Nice malty foundation and soothingly creamy with sweet notes (sticky toffee pudding vanilla cream caramel custard) integrating well with dry oak spice and fruit (peaches blueberry and currants).l Very easy-going and friendly. A very nice Glencadam and reasonably priced for its age."
5066,9,"(A Park Avenue Liquors exclusive). Shimmering gold color. Lovely creamy texture. This creaminess comes through in its flavors too binding to notes of vanilla malt shortbread and delicate honey. Floral notes citrus red currants and a wisp of peat provide contrast. An enjoyable nicely polished dram from a distillery whose whisky is underappreciated-especially the older expressions."
5067,1,"Okay how many of you have walked past this one thinking the price is just too crazily low for the liquid to be any good? How many have started your whisky life with this and then set it aside? Time to rethink. Speyburn one of the forgotten distilleries of Rothes is a charmer. Sweet and fragrant with notes of blossom and a little red fruit on the nose the palate shows ginger cream and rhubarb. (Value Pick)"
5068,1,"A very laid-back start with the sweetness of the sherry cask bringing a fat figgy dried fruit aroma which initially suppresses the peat only allowing a little pipe smoke and smoked meat to emerge. With water there’s balsam tar dried seaweed and fabric Band-Aid. This is repeated on the tongue with dark fruits suddenly changing to spent kiln and bonfire ashes but there needs to be more cohesion between the elements. £80"
5069,9,"Deep gold color. Aromas of creamy vanilla herbs wood spice and subtle fruit. Light and creamy in body. On the palate this whisky starts out clean and sweet with notes of vanilla and honey. It then turns dry with spicy herbal soft fruity notes finishing on the dry side."
5070,1,"Ahh Clynelish. The enigma of the northeast coast. A single malt whose waxy character — and it does smell of snuffed candles — is highly prized by blenders. This is a palate whisky the nose almost shy and muted: glints of citrus and jellied fruits notes of ozone/spiciness and stem ginger. It’s on the tongue that it comes into its own: clinging strangely savory lightly sweet juicily fruity. Enigmatic indeed."
5071,6,"Distilled in 1990 this rare expression was matured in refill American oak hogsheads. Quite shy on the nose even at cask strength. Ultimately faintly floral notes with pear drops vanilla and linseed. Very smooth on the palate with soft fruity malt vanilla peach and dark berries. Buttery mango and nutmeg in the finish. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (3954 bottles)"
5072,6,"This is a 1978 veteran from the rebuilt Linkwood Distillery. The nose is slightly musty even bitter with sawdust and apple peel. The palate is sweet with a suggestion of sherbet ‘fizz’ elusive peatiness and fruit spice plus vanilla walnuts and ultimately slightly grippy oak. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (6114 bottles)"
5073,6,"This is the fourteenth 12 year old Lagavulin bottling in the series and was aged in refill American oak hogsheads. Vanilla and wood smoke on the early nose then black pepper lemon marine aromas and scented notes with a hint of peaty yeast. Big sweet and direct on the smooth palate with milk chocolate and black pepper while the smoke keeps building. The finish is long and smoky with persistent pepper. Diageo Special Releases 2016 bottling."
5074,6,"This is finished for 8 months in tawny port pipes and is quite restrained on the early nose opening up to reveal rose petals milk chocolate and double cream.  The palate is floral with raisins  and red currants. Drying in the  finish with peppery oak and  cinnamon."
5075,6,"Distilled on June 20 1999 and bottled in November 2013 this expression from the Perthshire distillery of Edradour was matured for 14 years in a sherry butt. The outturn was 687 bottles. The nose is notably sweet with jammy aromas —strawberry and raspberry— while hazelnuts and walnuts lurk in the background. The same fruit and nut notes from the nose carry over along with sultanas candied peel Jaffa orange and spicy leather. The lengthy finish is viscous and gingery. £70"
5076,1,"Bold with a slightly blunt entrance. The cask influence is to the fore mixing rum and raisin with a slight yeasty/dough-like edge that sits alongside caramelized fruits. In time there’s sweet draff malt loaf (with butter) and the smell of old cupboards. It gets creamier with water. Medium-bodied with a light savory note in the middle that then drifts toward Brazil nut and Assam tea. A solid performer. Bristol Milk sherry rather than old oloroso. £55"
5077,1,"The impact given by secondary maturation in small (octave) sherry casks is what sets this range apart. Here Glen Grant’s light fruits are given a darker twist with some bodega notes blackberry and a surprising note of curry spices before milk chocolate develops; this is particularly apparent on the palate. The palate is gentle and quite creamy (cream sherry?) but it doesn’t like water. A pleasing dram. £99"
5078,6,"This Dalmore single cask variant was distilled in October 1996 and filled into a refill hogshead which yielded 139 bottles in January 2014. Freshly-mown hay then marzipan and nectarines on the well-spiced nose. Nutty caramel in time. The palate features Terry’s chocolate orange vanilla and nutmeg. Citrus fruits and malt in the finish with hazelnuts and a hint of oak. £90"
5079,1,"Good to see Pittyvaich back in the Special Release roster. Here we have the heavy nutty character of the distillery given full expression. The emphasis here is on a mix of nuts cake mix and dense fruits: even a little hint of cigarette tobacco. When neat the palate has real density that is enlivened by water which brings out fresher—and decidedly more green—notes. Worth a dram."
5080,6,"First released in 2008 Peaty Tang is a blend of 4 to 5 year old heavily peated and 8 year old unpeated whiskies. Pipe tobacco on the nose with damp undergrowth canned pears and smoked meat. Medium-bodied with light sweet peat smoke vanilla cereal green apples and licorice on the palate. Dark chocolate caramel and tangy smoke in the short to medium finish."
5081,9,"The stocks of the “new era” Longrow keep getting older (and better). A pleasingly sweet foundation of burnt caramel vanilla fudge and toffeed nuts is challenged by earthy peat tar damp barnyard and brine. Earthy smoky finish. A nice whisky with great potential but still needs a few more years."
5082,6,"The nose is more reticent than that of its younger sibling with less spice and succulent fruitiness. A hint of nougat but overall drier and ‘quieter.’ The palate is silky with walnuts and allspice while fruit notes are provided by plums. Following the overall theme here the finish is also drier than that of the 16 year old variant featuring a sprinkling of spicy cocoa powder. Relatively lengthy. Exclusively available to travelers at World Duty Free Group stores in selected airports throughout the UK and Spain. £90/liter"
5083,6,"This is the third single cask Distillery Edition cask strength. It was distilled in December 1996 and bottled as a 20 year old in April 2016. Coconut ice and vanilla fudge on the very sweet confectionery-led nose with a suggestion of salt in the background. Full and supple on the palate with a big hit of ripe apples then cinnamon and nutmeg. Very long in the finish with light black pepper. A Glen Scotia for those with a sweet tooth! (Distillery only bottling) £95"
5084,1,"Aultmore is normally light and estery and this pale dram is true to this. After a whiff of fresh turmeric there’s an almost oily green note with William pear before acetone and something akin to school Bunsen burners (a good smell) emerges. The palate is more coherent than the nose; sweet rounded and more substantial that you expect with tinned pears in custard. Lively and charming; shows none of the firmness of youth suggested by the nose."
5085,6,"The latest addition to Bowmore’s core range is presented at the unconventional age of 9 years. Matured predominantly in oloroso sherry casks with some bourbon cask-aged spirit thrown into the mix. The result is a whisky featuring drinking chocolate black pepper and soft peat on the nose. Sherry and sweet peat notes merge nicely on the palate with dates plums and light caramel. Smoky brine in the medium-length finish. £30"
5086,1,"Dailuaine is a fascinating distillery and this has a fascinating nose as it shows a heavy sulfury new make entering maturity and starting to pick up extra weight from the cask. There’s a glimpse of sweetness a little fruit but the dominant character is a savory meatiness (beef stock cubes). The palate shows dried mint and masses of this meaty/sweet interplay. Is it commercial? Probably not but it tells a really important story. I like it a lot. £45"
5087,1,"Initially very ozonic fresh and marine. So much so that you don’t notice the smoke which is slowly building. Everything is very restrained some cold-smoked fish mineral and—in time—a hint of the mash tun. That mineral note continues on the palate which broadens into ginger nuts in the middle of the tongue. All very well-balanced and at its best neat."
5088,7,"Most of Auchroisk's malt goes into Diageo’s J&B blended so a single malt release is an uncommon treat. Aged in refill sherry casks this whisky has a nutty roasted malt nose. On the palate it’s soft and lush with honeyed roasted malt walnut ginger and salt. A spicy mid-palate leads to a dry finish that abandons a lot of the flavors established. A solid mix of flavors but the finish shows why it's often used for blending. (U.S. only)"
5089,6,"This 1992 vintage from Clynelish distillery is part of Diageo’s Distillers Edition range of ‘finished’ single malts and it underwent a secondary period of maturation in oloroso seco casks prior to bottling. Sweet sherry honey and oranges on the nose with a gentle note of rum and cloves. The palate initially offers vibrant sherry sultana and hazelnuts with developing cloves angelica and spices. The finish is medium in length with a mild note of enduring ginger. £45 (Not available in the U.S.)"
5090,1,"As pale as you'd expect this year’s Special Release ‘limited’ bottling has a sweet bready softness to it making it less angular than previous expressions. The smoke comes across very gently allowing the sweet grassiness of the spirit the upper hand until water is added. The palate stirs in some emulsion paint a pleasing lift of sulfur and anise and gradually deepens. With water there are more smoke and marine notes."
5091,9,"One thing I enjoy about these vintage releases are the differences in personality from one vintage to the next. This 1998 vintage follows shortly after the 1994 and while that one was elegant and bright in personality this 1998 is more viscous and heavier in weight. It shows bright fruit (lemon caramelized pineapple tangerine) honeyed vanilla and marzipan with a peppering of cinnamon and ginger. Perhaps the 1994 as an aperitif and the 1998 a digestif? The 1998 is not nearly as post-prandial as say the 1972 vintage but it has more weight than the 1994 vintage. Still if I had to choose between the 1994 and 1998 my nod goes to the 1994 for its elegance and drinkability."
5092,6,"The latest release from Glen Garioch is a limited edition 1994 vintage produced when the distillery still boasted working floor maltings and is therefore more peaty than spirit subsequently distilled. Pear drops vanilla and developing caramel on the nose. Freshly-opened cigarette packets and in time brown paper and vinegar. Quite dry and austere on the palate with stem ginger and subtle smoke. Persistently spicy in the medium-length finish with an elusive late flurry of smoky chocolate caramel."
5093,9,"More mature peated Bunnahabhain Islay whiskies are emerging (like this one). Indeed tarry peat ash notes are evident throughout this one (especially on the finish!) along with nutty toffee nougat smoked olive glazed ginger and candied lime. Pretty even-keeled not as medicinal and aggressive as its cousins on the southern end of the island. The smoke and layered sweet notes balance nicely. If you’re looking to ease your way into smoky Islay whiskies this would be a good start."
5094,6,"This 10 year old expression from the Perthshire distillery of Glenturret has replaced the 12 year old. Glenturret is at the heart of The Famous Grouse blend and the distillery was re-branded as ‘The Famous Grouse Experience’ in 2002. Nutty and slightly oily on the nose with barley and citrus fruits. Sweet and honeyed on the full fruity palate with a balancing note of oak. Medium length in the sweet finish. £31 (Not available in the U.S.)"
5095,6,"Produced at Tullibardine distillery in 1989 this ex-bourbon hogshead has yielded 299 bottles. The expression lives up to its name with rum and raisin ice cream on the nose; floral with glacé cherries dried apricots and pistachio nuts. More nuts and lots of spice on the palate plus dark chocolate dates and prunes. The finish is medium in length with spicy benign oak. £85"
5097,9,"Here’s the older sibling to the 1997 vintage released in U.S. at the same time. It costs twice as much as the 1997 vintage and guess what? I like the less expensive 1997 vintage better (because of its lovely balance and creamy texture). Still this 1991 vintage is a nice whisky rich with vanilla coconut cream citrus (orange tangerine) pineapple and sultana. A soothing mouth-coating texture lingers with some polished oak on the finish."
5098,6,"Glengoyne’s entry-level 10 year old is the most readily available of their malts and is made using entirely unpeated malt. The producers claim this helps to preserve “the essence of its flavor.” Fresh and well-rounded on the nose with medium sweet aromas suggesting malt oak and a hint of sherry. Smooth and delicate on the palate it is slightly oaky with a suggestion of cooking apples. The finish is pleasingly long with buttery vanilla notes slowly drying."
5099,9,"Similar in personality to its younger standard 1993 and 1992 vintages -- soft and mellow with fresh barley vanilla cream puff cut grass and hay cookie dough and a dusting of pencil shavings. The extra aging shows on the whisky’s dried spice and polished oak finish. More sophisticated than its younger siblings although the younger vintages are more drinkable."
5100,1,"Pale with fresh perfumed/fragrant estery notes that touch on flower blossom almond icing on a custard cake and even a little candy floss. All very aromatically intense with quite a hot focus on the tongue. With water you keep the concentration and add in lemon jellied fruits and light dusty spiciness."
5101,6,"Distilled in September 1994 and bottled at 18 years of age as part of Douglas Laing’s Old Malt Cask series this Perthshire single malt displays a nose of malt loaf tinned prunes white pepper and a suggestion of soy sauce on the nose. Finally much more floral. Peppery on the palate with citrus fruit gunpowder tea medium sherry and cocoa powder. The powdery cocoa notes persist in the long spicy discreetly oaky finish.  £80"
5102,6,"A non-chill filtered bottling matured in a mixture of bourbon and red wine casks. The nose offers a big early orange hit vanilla and red wine notes. Smooth on the palate; more orange black pepper and spicy red wine.  The finish is relatively long and spicy with bitter chocolate orange. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
5103,1,"An interesting nose that’s somewhat akin to a peach cheesecake with slightly burnt pastry or a heavily caramelized crème brûlée. Overt smoke is in check when neat. In the mouth however it comes through massively mossy and oily and sitting on top of those fat fruits and sweet malt. Thicker and more farmyard-like than Port Charlotte. Great potential with a sweetness that shows it’s pretty much there. £150"
5104,6,"The latest vintage expression of Tomatin’s peated Cù Bòcan was aged in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Fishy smoke on the nose with ripe red apples toffee milk chocolate and malt. Creamy mouthfeel; ripe pears in peat smoke sweet spices. White pepper plain chocolate and a lick of licorice in the relatively long and lively finish. (11400 bottles)"
5105,6,"Balblair has released two Travel Retail-exclusive variants of its 2004 vintage matured in bourbon barrels and sherry casks respectively. The Sherry Matured version was aged in American and Spanish oak sherry butts. It is only available in Asia. Oriental spices soft leather and damsons on the nose. Milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight in time. The palate features lively spices cooking apples vanilla medium-sweet sherry and hazelnuts. Spices persist in the finish with honey and raisins."
5106,6,"Distilled in 2004 The Murray was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels and is offered at cask strength non-chill filtered. The nose opens with confident sweet fruit notes—overripe bananas and peach slices—with background milky coffee. Rich and sweet on the palate developing vanilla spices chewy tropical fruits. The finish is long with cinnamon licorice and oak tannins."
5107,6,"Following on from the official 8 year old release of Bladnoch distilled and matured under the current Raymond Armstrong regime comes a 9 year old variant in the familiar distillery label series. It offers a spring-like nose of cereal freshly-squeezed lemon juice meadow flowers and a hint of milky coffee. Spicy toffee apples honey and ginger on the palate which finishes with a floral note lemon apples and lively oak. £40"
5108,6,"This is the second edition of Auchentoshan’s cask strength Valinch bottling which carries no age statement and has been matured in first-fill bourbon casks. As with the previous Valinch expression only 2000 cases have been released globally. Very fragrant on the nose with pears applesauce and vanilla fudge. Spice cream and lively Jaffa oranges on the palate. A touch of (not unpleasant) new make spirit comes through in the relatively lengthy finish."
5109,6,"After eight no-age-statement releases of Edradour’s heavily-peated Ballechin the brand finally comes of age as a core product. It is bottled at 10 years of age after maturing in a combination of bourbon barrels and oloroso sherry casks. Earthy peat and fragrant spices on the nose old leather and faint toffee. The palate initially offers very fruity peat then newer leather aniseed and plain chocolate with lingering fruity peatiness. More plain chocolate and ginger in the smoky medium-length finish."
5110,6,"Part of Auchentoshan’s new travel retail line-up Springwood carries no age statement contains younger whiskies than Heartwood and has been matured in 100 percent ex-bourbon wood. Acetone tinned peaches in vanilla and whipped cream on the floral nose. The palate is clean and fruity initially citric with emerging apricots in honey and fresh spices. More spice in the finish with focuses on milk chocolate cinnamon and a suggestion of Madeira. €42"
5111,6,"This expression was released to celebrate the Scottish feature film “Fairy Flag” and after maturing for 8 years in bourbon barrels the whisky then spent 7 years aging in oloroso sherry casks. Initially meaty with rich sherry raisins and cocoa powder then increasing vanilla notes plus warm leather and wood polish. Sweet and very spicy on the palate with caramel chili and cinnamon. The finish is medium in length with peppery plain chocolate. £65"
5112,6,"This bottling of 1990 whisky from the demolished Littlemill Distillery was initially matured in ten American and European oak casks before being married and finished in first-fill oloroso sherry casks. Boiled fruit sweets subtle vanilla red apple peel and cereal on the nose. The palate is rich sweet and full. Intense fruitiness then fruit spices hazelnuts and some oak notes. Very long in the finish with aniseed and plain chocolate. Mildly tannic at the last. Complex and satisfying. (1500 bottles)"
5113,9,"A very fragrant fruity whisky (orange tangerine plum nectarine) with interwoven notes of honeyed malt toasted oak vanilla and subtle anise. I love the creamy mouth-coating texture of this whisky and its soothing finish. All the vintages of Glenrothes that have been released over the years are worthy of your hard-earned money and this one is no exception. There's not as much depth as some of the older more mature expressions but the lively youthfulness of this whisky makes up for it."
5114,9,"This 1984 Vintage is similar in profile to its older 1972 Vintage sibling (reviewed above) except that the 1972 Vintage expresses greater depth and has more oak to balance the sweetness (the sherry notes get a bit sappy in this 1984 expression). The 1972 Vintage also evolves more on the palate and it is more intriguing. But don't let this keep you from trying this 1984 Vintage expression. It is still a very enjoyable whisky (and more economically priced)."
5115,6,"Following on from another 1999 single cask Aberfeldy in the previous batch of Wemyss Malts’ releases we have Toffee Tuile matured in a hogshead. The nose is sweet and approachable with tinned fruit cocktail vanilla malt and fresh ginger. Tropical fruit brittle toffee hazelnuts a hint of caramel and more ginger on the nose. The finish is medium in length fruity and mildly spicy. (393 bottles) £88"
5116,6,"This vintage edition of Oban was distilled in 1999 and finished in montilla fino sherry casks which lend a greater richness and complexity to the Oban house style without detracting from its essential characteristics. It was bottled in 2014. The nose is fragrant with musky pineapple and salted caramel. Silky on the palate with Seville oranges ginger nuts and cloves plus a faint suggestion of brine. Persistent orange and dry spice notes in the oaky medium-length finish. £75"
5117,6,"Cù Bòcan is the lightly-peated variant of Tomatin single malt and while most Cù Bòcan is matured in a combination of sherry bourbon and virgin oak casks this expression was exclusively aged in virgin oak. Fragrant on the nose with lemon lanolin vanilla poached pears and peppery rye notes. Rich spice and vanilla on the palate zesty and warming with apple pie and caramel. The finish is medium in length with spiced fresh oak. (Worldwide except U.S.) £50"
5118,7,"A 15 year malt selected by the Loch & K(e)y Society. Hard apple cider leads the nose and is backed by honeyed malt and cinnamon-baked pear. The entry is lush caramel apple but quickly transitions as the sheer power and spice of the mid-palate comes crashing in with oak ginger and pine. The finish is long dry and spicy with lingering heat. This is the kind of big bold dry whisky that American whiskey drinkers might enjoy. (Julio’s Liquors only)"
5119,6,"Quite youthful on the nose with barley vanilla and finally nectarines. Smooth and medium-bodied with floral notes custard and milk chocolate. A relatively short finish with sappy oak."
5120,6,"Just 450 cases of this veteran expression from Old Pulteney have been released offered in non-chill filtered format after maturation in a mixture of bourbon casks and Spanish oak sherry casks. Light fruit notes on the nose notably tangerines plus vanilla lemon and sea salt. Orchard fruits spicy sherry worn leather and cocoa powder on the silky palate. Spicy and drying in the finish with mild oak tannins."
5121,6,"This 20 year old single cask release from the Perthshire distillery of Aberfeldy runs to 242 bottles matured in a hogshead. Apricots green apples ginger and icing sugar on the nose. Soft fruits notably peaches gingery oak and more icing sugar on the palate. Milky coffee caramel and eucalyptus in the slightly oaky medium-length finish. £90"
5122,6,"The nose opens with savory notes. Richer more fragrant and profound sherry than is present in the Fino or Manazanilla expressions. Full-bodied with big musty sherry notes and Seville oranges on the palate plus lots of spice. Gum-tingling spices with sultanas and dates in the finish."
5123,6,"Named after a mythical hellhound that is said to stalk the area around Tomatin distillery Cù Bòcan is lightly peated and matured in a combination of virgin oak bourbon and sherry casks. Just 60000 liters are produced each year. Lemonade and coconut on the early nose with developing almonds. Slightly earthy with soft smoke. Rich full mouthfeel malt and honey with the smoke more evident now plus cinnamon and cloves. Nutty. Lingering oak and dry peat smoke in the finish."
5124,6,"Bottled in 2014 this expression of Glenkinchie was distilled in 2000 and finished in amontillado sherry casks. The amontillado gives a more rounded feel and greater profundity to the single malt. Peaches apricots almonds and soft ginger on the nose Smooth and balanced on the palate gently spiced and nutty with cherries caramel discreet sherry and vanilla. The medium-length finish features vanilla and lingering spicy Jaffa oranges drying slowly to oak. £63"
5125,9,"Richer thicker and more lush than the 1975 vintage reviewed here. Fallen orchard fruit sticky toffee pudding and nuts with underlying suggestions of date cake. Emerging dried spice and oak resin towards the finish. A good contrast to the 1975 vintage."
5126,6,"The Aberdeenshire distillery of Glen Garioch has released its first ever virgin oak-matured expression which has employed heavily charred American oak barrels. According to master blender Rachel Barrie “Glen Garioch’s intense flavor means it holds up well in a new fill cask.” Ripe peaches on the nose spicy oak vanilla and more soft floral notes in time. Malt milk chocolate nectarines nougat and mild cloves on the palate while the finish is medium in length with ginger and lively oak."
5127,9,"The newest release in Balvenie’s limited edition range and the first venture back into smoke since the “Islay Cask” limited release several years ago. Some of this whisky was finished in a peated cask some in new American oak. Both influences emerge with the smoke (jerky with a hint of kippers) and spice (cinnamon vanilla nutmeg) on a foundation of honeyed malt. Spicy smoky finish. Balvenie is one of those big Speyside whiskies that can stand up to the smoke. This one will not appeal to everyone but it makes for an interesting diversion."
5128,12,"The scents of a forest floor—dried leaves old pine needles twigs—mingle with stewed fruit biscuity malt lemon oil and rose petal soap. The palate is light and candy-sweet like strawberry jelly beans candied rose petals and sugar cookies tinged with cinnamon. Youthful and very light but pleasant. (Total Wine & More)"
5129,12,"An initial aroma of carrot peelings gives way to cedar allspice lemon and chamomile; with water added carrot cake almond shell and lemon icing emerge. On the palate there’s chamomile tea with lemon and clove candied violet orange and cedar swooping into a finish of oak and dried flowers. (Total Wine & More)"
5130,12,"A delicate grassy nose with aromas of bread dough green bananas cardamom and lemon. Light-bodied on the palate with pleasant flavors of cardamom lemon and white pepper it rushes through to a more substantial finish of roasted walnuts tobacco leaf unsweetened chocolate and oak. (Total Wine & More)"
5131,12,"Sulfury funk on the nose might intimidate but it’s a harbinger of the whisky’s strong sherry influence. There are also aromas of cinnamon allspice tangy stewed fruit roasted almonds and saline. The palate is intensely floral with raisins dried figs hazelnuts red berries and a little milk chocolate. Richly flavored but light-bodied; a gentle sherried whisky. (Total Wine & More)"
5132,12,"On the nose spiced plums cinnamon clove ginger and cooked fruit mingle with seawater and a waft of guava. A tug of war between sweet—orange oil cookies with lemon icing—and spice—cloves dried ginger—resolves into a finish of milk chocolate with a hint of hookah tobacco. This is light and a bit hot but its perfumy character shows well. Finished in first-fill bourbon barrels. (Trader Joe’s)"
5133,6,"Batch 2 runs to 295 bottles and in common with the rest of the range carries no age statement. Peaches in brandy ginger honey and milk chocolate on the pleasingly floral nose. The palate is silky with more floral notes plus cedar oak and soft spices. Almonds and allspice in the medium length finish. £63/500 ml"
5134,6,"This is a distillery bottling from the now-demolished Lowland plant of Littlemill near Glasgow and the release consists of 4550 bottles. There has been no chill filtration. Fresh pineapple and mango on the nose inflated balloons a hint of vanilla and cocoa powder. Medium-bodied with focused tropical fruits ginger and caramel. Lengthy in the finish with gentle spice and milk chocolate-coated toffee. £130"
5135,9,"Ardmore whiskies I’ve enjoyed in the past have been soothingly malty. Many have also been recognizably smoky which is rare for a Speyside whisky. This one aged in a first fill bourbon barrel is true to its roots. It is a clean whisky with a creamy soothing maltiness throughout. The palate is entertained by notes of vanilla and honey with anise white pepper and a teasing smokiness. The thick maltiness and soft smokiness linger long on the finish. A very underrated whisky."
5136,9,"Color is antique gold while the aroma is dry but creamy with notes of vanilla marshmallow honey and tropical fruit (pineapple coconut). Palate is malty and creamy up front with vanilla marshmallow and a hint of honey; briefly becoming fruity (again the tropical fruits) before turning dry and oaky with a big long dry finish (especially for a triple-distilled Lowlander). Lowland whiskies are known for maturing nicely at a younger age. But most people don't know that some (especially Auchentoshan) are delicious at older ages too. As mentioned in my 'From the Stills' column older vintages of Auchentoshan are now only being offered to individual retailers one cask at a time and this is one of those casks. It is one of many 1966 vintage Auchentoshan whiskies I have enjoyed over the past 15 years. Auchentoshan from a balance and complexity perspective seems to be best in the 20-30 year old range. Still having said this this one holds up fairly well for its age. Available exclusively at Park Avenue Liquors."
5137,1,"Pale straw. One of a seemingly never-ending stream of Imperials from Duncan Taylor all of which show remarkable consistency and are rarely over-wooded thereby allowing the distillery character to shine. Here are echoes of Loire Sauvignon Blanc — nettles gooseberry cut grass fennel tops and fresh herbs — with a hint of Imperial’s giveaway American cream soda softness. The palate is as soft as soy milk. Classic Imperial.£38"
5138,9,"Predominantly fruity -- the sherry cask is obvious but it’s not heavy or dominant. Clean bright orchard fruit blends in nicely with strawberry rhubarb pie light toffee dates dark chocolate and polished oak. Long soothing oily finish. Another solid effort from this young distillery."
5139,9,"When I toured Glenfarclas in May 2008 George Grant told me that while it is usually not their policy to stray from aging their whisky in sherry and bourbon oak casks they have done some experimenting. One of these experiments aged entirely in a port cask has finally been bottled. The nice thing about Glenfarclas is that it is a rich spirit and can stand up to a good dose of port wine (or sherry for that matter). The port notes are lush with ripe fruit (plum red grape skin caramelized apricot prune) and dates complementing the whisky’s malty maple syrup foundation. The 27 years also impart a good dose of polished oak for balance. Not as complex as other Glenfarclas whiskies of this age but this is certainly a solid enjoyable change of pace for Glenfarclas. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
5140,9,"A soft easy-going whisky with a foundation of honeyed vanilla caramel custard and mouth-coating maltiness. Floral and brine notes are sprinkled throughout as are cocoa white pepper and subtle edible seaweed. Soft malt and brine finish. A whisky with a gentler personality when compared to most other island malts making it a nice introduction to the style. I would however like to see this whisky bottled at a higher strength and not chill-filtered. I’d be more than willing to sacrifice some drinkability for greater intensity and more subtle nuances. Still it is an enjoyable whisky and enthusiasts of its predecessor -- Scapa 14 -- should also like it albeit at a higher retail price."
5141,6,"Tullibardine Aged Oak Edition carries no age statement though it contains a blend of whisky more than 15 years old and spirit produced since the distillery reopened in 2003. It has been matured in former bourbon barrels. The nose exhibits barley citrus fruits pear drops crystallized ginger marzipan and cocoa. Oily in the mouth and slightly earthy with brazil nuts and developing vanilla fudge and lemon on the palate. Fruitiness persists through the spicy finish."
5142,1,"Light amber. A very clean mealy and creamy nose with real sweetness and a belt of vanilla before things settle into the realm of cooked fruits enlivened by masses of peppermint. The oak shows itself as hot sawdust and a little cedar. In the mouth that sweetness continues to alternate between a prickly feel and sweet fruit syrups while Macallan’s oily earthiness anchors it both on the tongue and to the distillery. 285 bottles."
5143,9,"Sounds more like a disease than a whisky. A peated version of BenRiach with the tarry smoke melding nicely with toffee bramble and rhubarb. Lingering earthy smoke on the finish and slightly tannic with subtle fruit. Good mouthfeel on this one."
5144,1,"The decline in the Spanish market has resulted in Cardhu becoming more widely available which is A Good Thing as far as I am concerned. This is a grassy malt which at 12 years also has a heightened citric spray of sweet orange zest and a gingery aspect (it’s great with ginger ale). Intense and vibrant with macadamia and a light heathery note the palate confounds expectations having a thick chewiness before the grass zings through adding lift."
5145,9,"A nicely balanced Laphroaig with a soothing malty sweetness layered in between the smoke peat tarry rope and iodine. Underlying notes of vanilla bean caramel custard grist anise coconut blueberry and a dusting of cocoa add subtle complexity."
5146,1,"As with the ‘Fiddich (reviewed in this issue) here’s a malt where an improved wood policy has brought a dram to life and added complexity. The Glenlivet has always been about lightness but the trick is to have sufficient solid base to allow its flower to blossom so as well as lily orchid and pineapple there’s a thick creaminess that gently beds all of these flighty flavors down. With water there’s mandarin and rose petal and a sneeze of white pepper. Simply lovely. Value Pick"
5147,6,"Auchentoshan Valinch is essentially a cask strength version of the popular Classic expression. It is named after the metal tube used to extract samples of spirit from the cask. A nose of tinned peaches in syrup Madeira cinnamon newly-planed wood coconut and vanilla notes. Sweet and spicy on the creamy palate with vanilla honey and praline. Oak and spice in the peach liqueur-like finish."
5148,9,"Straw gold. Well rounded with fresh vanilla berries in cream caramel custard toasted oak and gentle dried spice. A really nice everyday anytime dram. The best price/quality ratio of the range. (Price is per 1 liter.)"
5149,6,"The first Glen Garioch vintage to be exclusive to Travel Retail outlets and also the only one so far to post-date the closure of  their on-site floor maltings. This leads to a less peaty note in the spirit than in other vintages. Matured in first and second-fill bourbon casks. Tinned peaches in syrup and nougat on the nose. Sweet malt heather honey vanilla restrained cinnamon nutmeg and ginger on the palate. Subtle oak notes in the lengthy finish. £50"
5150,6,"One of the latest single cask bottlings (354 bottles) from Wemyss Malts specifically for the U.S. “A Day at the Coast” was sourced from the East Sutherland distillery of Clynelish. Ozone warm sand and wild grasses on the nose plus a hint of honey grated ginger and a freshly-opened box of milk chocolates. The viscous palate features rock salt white pepper coconut green apples and a squeeze of lemon. Medium to long in the finish softly citric and salty."
5151,9,"(Exclusive to Park Ave Liquors New York NY) A rich clean bright whisky with aromas of honey marshmallow vanilla and a mélange of fruit (orange peaches lemon pineapple). Creamy in texture and richly flavored without being heavy or cloying. The various fruit notes dance on the palate and add complexity to the sweetness. Long soothing finish. Great after dinner-given its considerable weight but lively enough to have before dinner."
5152,6,"One of four Spring 2013 single cask releases from Wemyss Malts Fruit Bonbons was distilled at Glen Garioch in 1989 and bottled during 2012. The out-turn was 325 bottles. Homemade lemonade and a dash of table salt on the early nose then heather ginger and finally the sweetness of icing sugar and fudge. Apples coated in cinnamon nutmeg caramel and dark treacle on the palate. The finish dries from apple pie to oak and plain chocolate. £90"
5153,9,"Certainly not the best Mortlach I’ve tasted but it’s a solid effort and at a good price for a 21 year old. Nicely balanced — Lorne Mackillop’s hallmark — and somewhat reserved too (for a Mortlach) with intriguing lime kiwi caramel floral notes (on the nose) nutty toffee (especially on the palate) soaked barley and charcoal with a rather syrupy mouth-clinging texture toward the finish. Worth a look."
5154,6,"This 30 year old bottling from Teaninich was distilled in December 1982 and matured in a refill butt. Just 201 bottles have been released from cask #9323. The nose is characterized by lemon curd flat Coca-Cola and spicy malt. The palate is smooth sweet and fruity with vanilla and stem ginger. Autumn berries and more ginger figure in the lengthy slightly charred finish. £195"
5155,9,"This one stands out from the other three because of its port wood finishing. Dark amber/ruby color. You’ll discover lush fruit and a rich nuttiness on top of the typical flavors expressed in the 18 year old. Additional layers of intense spice and oak notes balance the whisky’s sweetness and fruit. The heartiest of the bunch."
5156,9,"This young distillery’s fourth release aged entirely in bourbon barrels. (This is the first one available in the U.S.) The two previous releases that I tasted and reviewed (the inaugural release and the Autumn 2009 release) were finished in sherry casks. I miss the sherry to be honest. I think it softened the whisky added a new dimension and perhaps even masked some of the youth. Still this is a very nice effort: brisk vibrant and bracing with plenty of raw peat smoke and tar along with pear citrus vanilla licorice root bourbon barrel char clove bitter chocolate and suggestions of olive brine and high-end mescal."
5157,6,"The oldest expression in the Tullibardine lineup provides malt cedar stewed apples and wood shavings on the nose. Mouth-coating with orange and cocoa powder. Dries quite steadily with oak lurking behind ripe bananas in the lengthy finish. Another very accomplished old Tullibardine but the notably pleasing palate of the 20 year old just gives that bottling the edge."
5158,6,"Initially aged in first-fill bourbon barrels then finished in Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. On the nose ripe peaches apricots vanilla caramel and mildly smoky sherry surface. The slightly viscous palate offers more sherry wood spices cinnamon salted caramel oak peanuts and a hint of salt. The finish is medium in length herbal and drying with sea salt."
5159,9,"Longmorn’s signature is a thick mouth-coating honeyed maltiness which is almost chewy in texture. While delicious in its teens its personality lends itself to aging because its maltiness provides a good counterpoint to the resinous dry oak notes which are usually imparted to older whiskies. This whisky is no exception. Notes of honey vanilla malt and subtle fruit dovetail nicely with the dry resinous polished leather-like contributions from 29 years in oak. Nice long finish."
5160,6,"This 1980 expression of The Dalmore Constellation has been solely matured in a Gonzales Byass Apostoles oloroso sherry butt. The resultant whisky is sweet on the nose with dates figs milk chocolate-covered caramel and finally a suggestion of eucalyptus. Briefly fruity on the palate becoming bitter with dark coffee notes. Long and spicy in the finish with black pepper and licorice. Cask number 2140; 227 bottles."
5161,9,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Walnut Aroma: Richly sherried and thick with notes of nuts and toffee. Wood resins contribute spice and variety. Fruitcake at Christmas. Palate: Thick chewy in texture and quite ripe. Again the fruitcake. Very deep and mature with some underlying maltiness. Dry spicy oak notes fight off all that sherry and add balance and complexity. Long soothing finish."
5162,6,"The Glasgow-based independent bottler Douglas Laing & Co. Ltd. has been responsible for quite a number of releases from the ‘lost’ Lowland distillery of Rosebank and this one was distilled during January 1990 and bottled in April 2012. The nose is pleasingly floral and fragrant light and gently honeyed with a suggestion of barley in the background. The palate features spicy sweet orange herbs and a slightly contrasting note of citrus fruit. Spices persist into the warming lightly-oaked finish. £135"
5163,6,"The first Lowland single malt bottling to be made available in the U.S. by the Creative Whisky Co. this 24 year old cask strength single cask bottling from the now-demolished Lowland distillery of Littlemill offers toffee fresh pineapple and sultanas on the pleasing nose. Voluptuous in the mouth; mellow with vanilla cocoa powder and soft spice notes. Brazil nuts and old oak in the gingery finish."
5164,1,"The mid-priced Fèis Ìle release took Bowmore off into darker than usual territory. The key here was how the cask (PX is after all as sweet a sherry as you can find) had been so well controlled. Rather than being a thick sweet mess a balance was struck between the two elements: the cask added density and raisined fruit while the distillery gave aromatic smoke and orange and both combine to layer on molasses leather and dark chocolate. A success. £100"
5165,1,"The annual (albeit limited) Loch Gorm release allows you to chart Kilchoman’s development in sherry casks. Here first-fill and refill sherry casks (oloroso to be precise) were used. The latter seem to have more of a say as the distillery character is more apparent: sweet fruit marine smoke and clementine before the golden raisin from the cask develops. The palate is smokier and also more overtly sherried. A bolder style but very well balanced. Limited so get in there ASAP."
5166,6,"A combination of first-fill and refill bourbon casks was employed for maturation followed by 6 months of finishing in first-fill oloroso sherry butts. The nose proclaims youthfulness with metallic notes and a hint of yeast but the sherry casks provide walnut old leather tobacco and orange. Sherry freshly planed wood white pepper and red currants on the palate. Plums dipped in sherry on the finish."
5167,1,"Remarkably rich color indicative of a first-fill cask. A clean if hot nose with carpenter’s workbench Comice pear and lots of oak. Aultmore’s acidity comes through on the palate with its zingy intensity cutting through the wood and achieving a certain balance. The palate shows a mix of fruit and wood sugars. Young certainly but bottled at the right time given the intensity of the wood element. Water makes it more sappy and summery. Not hugely complex but fun."
5168,1,"Here the distillery character is more restrained as if it is taking a period of calm reflection before the next evolution. There’s slightly more maltiness here and the texture has changed into a light acacia honey stickiness and a development of more oxidized notes showing a gentle maturation. It’s one I kept going back to; teasing slightly elusive but rewarding. £1300"
5169,1,"Brimming with distillery character. Gentle malty notes come through initially accompanied by apple core and classic ‘Farclas weight. The alcohol though high is not obtrusive. In time there’s some orange marmalade and this bittersweet element helps to add another layer of complexity. Water brings out toffeed depth. Even neat it isn’t too hot showing heft rather than bludgeoning power. In time there’s black cherry chocolate and a hint of smoke. Highly recommended."
5170,1,"Pale gold with nettles and green apple on the nose alongside almond light bread crust and freshly-baked sponge cake. In time there’s Starburst sweets. Some heat even at this relatively low strength. There are mineral accents and with water the signature ginger. The palate is very sweet and soft with jelly fruits. Clean and supple especially with water. Zesty with a refreshing acidic balance."
5171,6,"This expression of Edradour was distilled in April 2006 and was the fifth batch to be matured in Barolo wine hogsheads. Fruity farmyard aromas spice then developing heather honey soft oak and caramel. Earthy fruit notes on the palate with walnuts malt and pepper. Mildly mouth-drying in the medium-length finish with aniseed and black pepper. (2000 bottles) £50"
5172,1,"As if making up for lost time wee bottles of Kininvie are popping out every month. This is a fine demonstration of the distillery style which sits—appropriately enough—between the lightness of Glenfiddich and the fruity sweetness of Balvenie. Here flowers are to the fore along with creme anglaise and a light herbal edge. There’s some weight to the palate but very little oakiness. A perfumed finish akin to elderflower maintains the frothy floral aspect. A perfect spring dram. £120"
5173,6,"Matured in refill bourbon barrels this Tomatin is softly floral on the nose with sweet fruit spices pineapple vanilla and honey. The palate is fresh and fruity with cream milk chocolate and nutty spice. Fruity to the end notably ripe apples and red berries plus more milk chocolate before slightly drying oak notes develop. £70"
5174,9,"Every once in a while you get whisky where the palate is completely different than the nose. This is one of those whiskies. Aged in bourbon casks and 37 years old its aroma expresses tropical fruits (similar to other older Bowmores) with papaya lemon mango strawberry coconut and banana. This is balanced by vanilla crème brûlée honey and just a wisp of smoke. Bowmore’s Islay roots are more expressive on the palate which starts off sweet and slightly oily quickly evolving to tropical fruit damp oak and then leafy smoke through to the finish. The sweetness emerges again towards the finish with subtle brine and seaweed. (120 bottles for the U.S.)"
5175,9,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Bright gold Aroma: Rose petals lavender vanilla soft fruity esters. Palate: Creamy vanilla and a touch of honey up front becoming gently fruity with a soft maltiness. Clean delicately complex finish of polished oak and soft floral notes."
5176,1,"This is a venerable Lagavulin which immediately shows its age with a nose that mixes the savory (hoisin sauce) with the mature notes of dunnage warehouse sandalwood and a minty lift. In time there’s bog myrtle old attics rain-moistened wool and a smokiness akin to a dead briar pipe. Slightly dull to start it perks up in the mid-palate with lanolin and black olive brine and a Darjeeling-like grippiness. Interesting for sure but past its best. (1868 bottles)."
5177,9,"Amber color. Complex exotic aromas of vanilla fudge coconut white chocolate plum cherry citrus and a hint of smoke and bourbon. Light to medium in body and delicate. On the palate there’s a brief encounter of caramel and fruits mentioned above. After that most of the flavors come from the wood-dry vanilla mint layered spicy oak notes with some smoke emerging from time to time. Dry oaky finish. I am in love with the aroma-it’s so exotic and intriguing. I would pay just to smell this whisky. But the flavors on the palate are less exotic and more influenced by the wood."
5178,9,"Straw gold color. Aromas reminiscent of a bouquet of flowers honey soft fruit and vanilla. Light to medium in body but mouth-coating. Honey flowery fruit gum drop flavors eventually turning dry and gently spicy with a polished oak finish."
5179,9,"Aged in a sherry cask and the lush fruity notes add dimension and richness without masking the whisky’s other flavors. Its flavors are reminiscent of crumbled peat thrown over a campfire; damp earth anise and floral notes throughout dovetailing with the lush sherried fruit. Smoky briny finish. A well-rounded dram."
5180,1,"Now you see it now you don’t. Brought back like Frank Sinatra for last year’s 200th anniversary celebrations here’s Laphroaig in gentle Islay sunset mode all soft fruits and oils. There’s typical marine-like smokiness of course—particularly on the palate. I’d go neat with this to observe what is rather excellent balance. And snap it up who knows when there will be another?"
5181,9,"Still in the same vein as its 17 year old sibling reviewed above but it’s softer mellower with more wood impact (especially on the nose and back end of the palate) and tea leaves. Perhaps even some mild tobacco. Darker sugars in this one (molasses?) rather than honey and more berried fruit along with the citrus which struggles to reveal itself. Dry resinous finish. An enjoyable dram even if the wood outstays its welcome. But if you have to pick between the two expressions go for the 17 year old and pocket the change with a smile on your face. Price: £75"
5182,9,"Quite fresh for 24 years old. Invigorating notes of brine spice (especially pepper and mustard seed) tropical fruit and vanilla malt and an appetizing lingering brine finish. Well-rounded and a nice balance between youthful zing and maturity. My only wish is to see this bottled at a higher strength and not chill-filtered"
5183,6,"This 18 year old variant of Ledaig from Tobermory distillery on Mull was released in spring 2015 and is finished in oloroso sherry casks. Old warm leather predominates on the early nose with salt pencil shavings a suggestion of asphalt and dried fruit. Big fruit and spicy peat notes on the robust palate which features sherry and a sprinkling of brine. Drying slowly with licorice and marginally tannic oak behind persistent smoke."
5184,6,"This expression has been matured entirely in bourbon casks and offers a fresh nose of ozone and lemon becoming quite fragrant in time. More mouth-coating than might be expected yet easy drinking with milk chocolate malt tropical fruits and an edge of sea salt. The finish is medium in length with wood spices. £40/liter"
5185,6,"Torfa is apparently Old Norse for “turf” or “peat” and this no age statement Glenglassaugh was made using malt peated to around 20 ppm phenols. Heathery peatiness on the early nose with dried fruits malt and cream soda. Ultimately leathery mellow smoke. Sweet and lively on the palate after an initial flavor of coal soot with ripe peaches chili and ginger backed by floral peat and a hint of ozone. Spicy peat smoke in the relatively long and fruity finish. £40"
5186,6,"This Balblair vintage replaced the previous 1997 bottling and maturation took place in a mix of bourbon barrels and sherry butts. The nose offers milk chocolate candied ginger caramel honey and musty oranges. Relatively dark fruits on the palate with licorice honey and vanilla. A medium to long finish spicy with slight oakiness."
5187,6,"With only a 10 year old house bottling of Glenturret available brand owners the Edrington Group have collaborated with independent bottler Hunter Laing to produce this ‘semi-official’ 26 year old expression matured entirely in refill bourbon casks. Pineapple dates honey and hard toffee on the floral nose. Full-bodied waxy and chewy on the palate with vanilla ginger cherry liqueur chocolates and dark spices. Lengthy in the finish with emerging bitter chocolate notes. £300"
5188,6,"The entry level no age statement expression of Glen Garioch offered at an unusually high ABV for a single malt in this price range.  Grapefruit  lively spice vanilla malt and black pepper on the nose. Milk chocolate chili cooking apples and something slightly savory on the palate. Citrus fruits and lots of spice in the relatively lengthy finish. An unusual and pleasing dram for the money. £32"
5189,6,"Offered in the ‘Distillery Labels’ series by Gordon & MacPhail this expression from Wick’s Pulteney distillery hearkens back to the era when Gordon & MacPhail was its principal bottler and 8 its standard age. Aged in refill bourbon barrels. Soft fruits dried grass and faint wood smoke on the nose. Smooth and nutty on the palate with smoky spice a sprinkling of salt and ripe pears. The finish is medium in length mildly peppered nutty and oaky."
5190,9,"Aged in bourbon casks and then enhanced in Rioja wine casks. A mélange of red berry fruits firm malt thick vanilla and spicy oak along with a hint of grape skin anise and orange peel. Gritty dry finish."
5191,9,"Aged in refill sherry casks. One taste bears this out with its dominant honeyed fruit foundation (lemons melons pineapple). Still that Bruichladdich freshness and appetizing ""sea breeze"" character dovetails nicely. Fuller more rounded and with a bit more going on here than the Full Strength expression reviewed below but not as appetizing."
5192,1,"Big sherry influence immediately with walnut skin raisin bread and mixed peels. Seems pretty dry and the malty undertow here is whole grain bread. Balvenie’s signature sweetness comes across like soft brown Demerara sugar before it shifts into forest floor mulch nut and dried berries. Just enough residual sweetness to keep the tannins at bay. Water makes it more woody with burlap cacao a little earthiness and a slightly bitter exit."
5193,9,"Aged in used bourbon barrels. A fresh appetizing whisky of brine and white pepper with an underlying foundation of vanilla barley and grassy/hay-like notes. A very subtle teasing of citrus lingers throughout. Very clean and straight-forward with an appetizing finish. A whisky aperitif?"
5194,1,"Amber. A thick nose with touches of fresh varnish and a little oiliness. Has some substance and weight and the heavy florals (lily jasmine) typical of mature Craig alongside toffee. The palate is ripe juicy and full the cask adding a slight resinous edge. Appears slightly smoky. Becomes fleshy even waxy with water and decidedly more elegant. The tannins are supple and some herbal notes emerge. It is at its best neat or with water on the side. £80"
5195,9,"It is unusual to find a Bruichladdich whisky with this much sherry influence-this one is aged in a refill sherry hogshead. I must admit that I generally like a less sherried Bruichladdich-it makes it easier to appreciate the distillery's subtle complexities. While there certainly is more than enough sherry to go around in this whisky the distillery character does manage to fight its way through. This whisky's strong point is that the sherry influence is clean and not insipid like some sherried whiskies. Chewy caramel toffee and ripe fruit notes are most evident in this whisky with Bruichladdich's signature-an appetizing fresh briny character-emerging midway on the palate through to the finish. If you like Bruichladdich and you appreciate a cleanly sherried whisky then I think you'll enjoy this one."
5196,6,"This 17 year old single cask (#10042) bottling of Highland Park was distilled in September 1996 and is presented non-chill filtered and with no added color in Douglas Laing’s Old Particular range. Baked cereal and peeled apples on the peaty nose while dark smoky notes contrast with lighter fruity flavors on the palate along with a sprinkling of pepper. The finish dries with more pepper bonfire embers and coffee grounds. £90"
5197,9,"Straw gold color. A very aromatic whisky with dry delicate herbal floral notes. Light and soft in body. Gentle on the palate-delicately sweet and fruity up front then becoming dry with herbal spice notes."
5198,6,"This relatively youthful whisky was matured in bourbon barrels before a period in Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. Sweet red berry notes on the nose with slightly smoky vanilla and caramel. Voluptuous in the mouth with spicy rich sherry notes sultanas and ginger. Spicy sea salt and lingering sherry in the finish. £37"
5200,1,"The newest member of the ever-expanding range hailing from Gordon & MacPhail’s own distillery in Forres. This example has been aged in port pipes — and it shows immediately on the nose. Benromach is a teasing mid-weight Speysider and this has added depth of sweet damson jam-like aromas mixed with Seville orange (marmalade) and some milky nut. Rich fruitcake flavors on the tongue. This is a very well balanced and precocious 12 year old. Worth a look."
5201,1,"Named in honor of the early Portuguese explorers this newest Glenfiddich expression has spent a lengthy period of secondary maturation in Madeira drums. This has given a rich sweet fruitiness — think blueberry muffins mixed with moss alongside date fig and black grape. The palate is sweet and smooth with a pickup of gingery spices toward the finish. Well balanced and quite a departure. (Travel Retail exclusive not available in the U.S.) £75"
5202,1,"A mix of two types of cask both refill. Typical Port Ellen on the nose very clean precise and austere hiding its sweetness in a new pigskin wallet. Though there are hints of apple and almond it has a chalky edge and surprisingly low levels of smoke. With water there’s squid ink and waxed paper. The palate starts with Darjeeling tea and roasted fruits then heads to the kelp-strewn seashore. As challenging as ever and actually a bit too dry. £600"
5203,6,"This bottling of Glenmorangie has been released to raise awareness of marine conservation. A proportion of the whisky has been finished in amontillado sherry butts. The nose offers honey vanilla peaches toffee bonbons wood lacquer sherry and a hint of peat. Soft and elegant on the palate with fruity spice nutty toffee more sherry and sweet smoke. Slightly smoky in the finish with soft oak citrus fruit and aniseed. (Travel Retail only) £60"
5204,6,"Taghta—Gaelic for “Chosen One”—is the result of Glenmorangie’s innovative Cask Masters program in which crowd-sourcing strongly influenced the final release. It is non-chill filtered and has been finished in manzanilla sherry casks. Fragrant slightly salty fruity sherry notes sweet spices on the nose. New leather and lots of spice on the palate with olives rock salt and a suggestion of red wine. Medium in length drying with licorice and black pepper. (12000 bottles) £65"
5205,6,"One of two single cask bottlings of 17 year old Clynelish released by Wemyss Malts in the fall of 2014. The hogshead provided 373 bottles. Pineapple and nectarines on the nose with salted caramel. Mildly herbal. The palate is rich and viscous with a sprinkling of pepper over sliced red apples sweet spices vanilla and hazelnuts. Lingering in the finish with lemon; nutty and lightly oaked. £68"
5206,6,"Distilled in June 1994 this example of Deanston was aged for 20 years in a refill butt which ultimately yielded 188 bottles. Quite shy on the nose a hint of starch gentle malt and ginger. Shows its true colors on the palate: relatively full-bodied and sweet with peaches and over-ripe apricots. Softly spiced. The finish is lengthy and sweet with cocoa powder and sprightly oak. £87"
5207,1,"Cardhu—for me at least—means intensity and this delivers precisely that with masses of
citrus (bergamot and grapefruit) and just a hint of dark chocolate behind. With
water there’s red apple and Victoria plum while the mouth is precise with
any richness cut with fresh acidity. Zesty and fresh on the finish. Try it in a
Bobby Burns. Released without any fanfare here’s evidence that Cardhu’s
rebuilding its reputation nicely. £66"
5208,6,"The latest in this Perthshire distillery’s ongoing Port Cask series of releases has been wholly matured in a bodega port butt since being distilled in 2003. The nose is fragrant featuring summer berries and glacé cherries while the palate suggests canned pineapple with cream contrasting with red wine notes. The finish is quite lengthy with raspberries spicy oak and a whiff of smoke."
5209,6,"A Glen Ord bottled by the London wine and spirits establishment of Milroy’s and a relatively rare opportunity to sample single malt from this Diageo-owned distillery. The nose initially presents lemon zest then peaches and caramel with cream soda notes. Very fruity and lively in the mouth with a nutty malty undercurrent. Medium in length; firm with spicy fruit lasting to the very end accompanied by a touch of well-mannered fresh oak. £45 Currently not available in the U.S."
5210,9,"Thick barley and viscous with ever-present brine and berried fruit throughout. Underlying notes of waxy fruit (no doubt from some sherry cask aging) clementine pineapple and black licorice emerge followed by the brine kicking in again towards the finish. The most rambunctious of the three."
5211,6,"Tullibardine has been offering a 1988 vintage edition for several years but in 2011 it bottled a new variant at 23 years of age matured in a mixture of first-fill bourbon barrels and ex-sherry hogsheads. Malt vanilla carnations and peaches on the full nose. The palate is initially sweet and fruity with toffee lively spices and more herbal notes duly appearing. The finish features cereal spice and white chocolate. £47"
5212,6,"Wemyss Malts names the sources of these single cask bottlings for the first time in the series. ‘Caribbean Fruits’ is a 1990 Glencadam. The hogshead in which it was matured has yielded just 320 bottles. Sweet on the nose with apricots fudge creamy vanilla and drinking chocolate. Tropical fruits on the palate with malt hazelnuts and spicy oak. Tannins and cocoa powder in the finish. £80"
5213,6,"Arran first introduced its peated Machrie Moor variant some five years ago; since then it has become a firm favorite. Late 2014 saw the appearance of the first cask strength edition of Machrie Moor limited to 6000 bottles. Wood smoke warm tar and emerging new leather on the bold nose. Sweet peat and spices on the palate barbecue sauce and black pepper. Long in the finish: vanilla with sweet smoke and chili."
5214,9,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Golden bronze Aroma: Syrupy. Honey. Fruit gum drops. Anise. Spearmint. Palate: Thick viscous surupy. Honey up front then becoming dry through to the end with notes of dried fruit mint and oak."
5215,6,"This 2002 expression of Balblair replaces the previous 2001 vintage as the ‘entry level’ bottling. It is naturally colored and non-chill filtered in line with the rest of the Balblair range and has been matured in bourbon barrels. Fizzy lemonade banana skins and violets on the nose with soft caramel developing in time. Fruit and nut milk chocolate on the palate with ripe apples and vanilla. Long floral and lively in the finish. £40"
5216,9,"Very thick in texture and mouthcoating -- almost chewy -- with ripe barley shortbread cookies and honey up front. Dried vanilla violet cinnamon and bright fruit notes emerge mid-palate. The dried spices and moderate oak tannins linger on the finish contrasting the whisky’s rich sweet entry. If this whisky were a road there would be a lot of hills."
5217,6,"Balblair’s 1996 vintage expression replaces the previous 1995 variant as a travel retail-exclusive bottling and maturation has taken place in bourbon casks. Ginger snaps peaches pineapple and vanilla on the relatively light fresh nose which also has just a wisp of smoke in the background. Medium-bodied the palate offers soft toffee milk chocolate spices and the same fruit notes as the nose. The finish is quite lengthy with a final flourish of black pepper. Price is per one liter."
5218,9,"The fourth release of peated Edradour whisky. This time it’s aged in oloroso sherry casks. There’s a lot going on in this whisky. Yeah it’s still a little on the young side but what it lacks in maturity is compensated by a dynamic youthful complexity. A distinctive whisky with coal tar damp kiln smoke caramelized fruit smoked almond walnut licorice stick and maple-cured bacon. Youthful sweet smoky lingering finish. I’m looking forward to future releases. (6000 bottles released but only 900 to the U.S.)."
5219,9,"A tamed Talisker. The classic Talisker personality shows-seaweed brine peat smoke and freshly ground pepper on the finish. There are even other interesting flavors I enjoy notably vanilla licorice root charcoal and bitter chocolate. But this whisky needs to be a little livelier to be a truly great whisky. While there’s no age statement there’s older whisky in here for sure and maybe that’s part of its “reserved” nature. It certainly is a nice whisky but I would prefer the more vibrant Talisker 18 year old -at two-thirds the cost."
5220,1,"There’s something rather round peg in a square hole about Tormore that grand urban palace of a distillery in wildest Speyside. The whisky sadly is often the same. Here though things look promising to start with: rice crackers and a spicy rye-like hardness on top of a vanilla-accented sweet trail mix of a nose with some earthiness behind. The palate for me is still too rigid. For all its efforts to relax this Tormore remains tense. £90"
5221,6,"Tomatin Legacy has been matured in a combination of bourbon and virgin oak casks and after an initial release in Europe worldwide availability will follow. Honey and malt on the nose melons; fragrant and mildly herbal. White pepper and ultimately a whiff of treacle. Fresh and lively on the sweet fruity palate with tinned pineapple cake mix and more pepper. Quite dry in the medium length finish with a suggestion of chili. £26"
5222,9,"Matured in oloroso casks. The oloroso takes what is typically a pleasingly honeyed but not particularly complex malt and adds a layer of fruit to it. Crisp clean notes of lemon pineapple and ginger are softened by honeyed malt vanilla and hay. Soft lingering finish."
5223,9,"A nice example of what port wood finishing should do for a whisky. The port influence (finished one year in a port pipe) has taken what would normally have been a fairly straight-forward whisky when it is young-clean light and dry with subtle notes of herbs and spices-and added some extra weight along with balancing sweet toffee and full fruit without dominating. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot.)"
5224,9,"What is it with all these older sherried bottles of Glen Grant from the independent bottlers anyway? Fortunately this is one of the nicer ones. The balance of sherry and oak is commendable and the flavor is clean with that Glen Grant “dried herb” character still evident. Sweet fruit notes (berries in honey peach pits sultana ripe grape) along with almonds and tobacco fill out the palate. Clean warming finish."
5225,9,"An interesting application of Macallan aged originally in a bourbon cask and then in Ridge Zinfandel barrels. Quite sweet and full-flavored with ripe jammy fruit beach plum subtle (yet deep) toffee and grape skin all laced with honey. Dynamic fun and carefree."
5226,9,"There’s plenty going on here but it’s not as vibrant as the other GlenDronachs. Lots of sherry influence viscous and a bit sappy with Curaçao honey-drenched fruit raspberry tart black cherry and ripe malt leading to a grape stem finish. An enjoyable whisky but my least favorite of the bunch."
5227,1,"One of Speyside’s youngest distilleries Tomintoul has been a relatively shy performer until recently when a raft of new releases (some peated) have appeared. This non-chill filtered example is for me the best of the bunch. Pale in hue it has a light clean floral aroma — think daffodils — with plenty of white fruits and very subtle oak. The palate has pear juice light vanilla and a long sweet finish. £34 (Not available in the U.S.)"
5228,9,"Matured in amontillado casks. Pleasantly fresh briny and yeasty which works nicely with the atypical toffee and nutty notes. Glenkinchie’s dry grassy character emerges occasionally as does some delicate background spice and a hint of lime. Pretty hefty stuff for Lowland malt."
5229,9,"Quite nutty (especially the latter half of the palate) with chewy toffee vanilla fudge subtle fruit and leafy smoke. I like the texture of this whisky. Quite satisfying. An improvement over the distillery-bottled 10 year old which I suggested (Vol. 16 No. 2) needed to reach its teens to begin to fully develop. This whisky validates my theory. (Bottled for Maxwell Street Trading Co.)"
5230,9,"Similar to the Classic in its tropical fruit and honeyed vanilla but with more depth emerging nuts and dried spice. Thicker too—with a slightly oily texture. A noticeable improvement from the Classic. This 12 year old is worth the few extra bucks. It’s the most rounded and balanced of the three new whiskies."
5231,1,"Amontillado casks are used here which add a certain almond-like note to the nose as well as more obvious oakiness. The effect is a general deepening and lengthening of aroma and flavor. The dry notes have gone replaced by a sweeter and more generous palette of flavors. The fresh meadow flowers are more like cut flowers in a florist shop the fruits hint toward peach and there’s a new citric burst on the finish."
5232,9,"Distinctively pale in color. (A hint of its age?) This annual limited edition release is finally available in the U.S. Youthful vibrant and thumping with the sea flowing through its veins. Coal tar peat smoke brine seaweed bright fruit (pear tangerine) and soft vanilla all compete for attention. The only thing holding me back from scoring it higher is that it comes across as a bit too youthful."
5233,1,"Meaty beaty big but only slightly bouncy. The nose is initially reminiscent of curried mutton with an added heathery earthiness and some distillery sulfur. It then dries into biltong/pemmican with some faint barley notes behind. The water adds a note of fresh coriander. Massive in the mouth with raisin roasting tins. It’s a relief when water releases some surprisingly soft treacle toffee sweetness but it’s not quite enough to balance the massive meaty assault. (2892 bottles)"
5234,1,"Light gold. Fresh and lightly nutty/biscuity combined with a gently swelling aroma of fruit syrups green grape lime (or green) jelly babies and Quetsch with that nut flour underneath. The palate is similarly smooth creamy and upfront with a decidedly acidic zing to the finish before the wood finally shows its presence. A soft delicious whisky that ticks all the right boxes but doesn’t really set the world alight. (2700 bottles)"
5235,1,"A new and welcome permanent member of the core Kilchoman range this comes from a mix of sherry finished and sherry matured whisky. The nose kicks off with a lovely cigar ash note—a cigar club toward the end of the evening—and while there are some dried fruits from the sherry Kilchoman’s gentle light character gives energy and lemony lift—shellfish grass and herbs. Lovely balance. Rounded softly fruity and highly approachable."
5236,6,"Hazelburn was first produced at Springbank during 1997. It varies stylistically from ‘traditional’ Springbank as it is triple distilled using unpeated malt. The 8 year old expression has been matured in 60 percent ex-bourbon and 40 percent sherry wood. The nose is fresh light fruity and faintly resinous with gentle spice. Sherbet malt and vanilla on the attractive and lively palate with developing spicy oak and a hint of pepper in the finish."
5237,1,"This is clearly Oban. Time in Montilla fino casks hasn’t diminished the fresh fruitiness. The orange zestiness has also been retained. Like the ‘Kinchie what the finish has done is allow the palate to thicken out and show what seems like a more mature personality. A new heavy floral note emerges. All in all there is greater concentration and ripeness with an added ginger note. Another edition that improves on the original."
5238,1,"An immediate and perhaps surprising smokiness which brings to mind cask-aged mezcal (tepeztate to be precise) and it is this green celery-accented element playing off some oily nutty and farmyard notes that gives balance and intrigue. Water reveals its youth but there’s enough cask action to add some weight to the palate where the natural sweet spirit shows itself. Keenly priced. Worth a look next time you are flying. (Travel Retail exclusive) £68"
5239,6,"This peated expression was matured in quarter casks and is the first bottling to be launched since BenRiach was acquired by Brown-Forman in April 2016. The nose offers sweet peat and new leather coal and a hint of iodine. White pepper and big peat notes on the palate. Ripe apples develop and spices spread around the mouth. The finish is medium in length warming and gently smoky. £65"
5240,6,"Initially matured in bourbon barrels for 6 years the spirit was then aged for a further 31 months in wine casks from the Hermitage Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée. Soft on the nose with fresh red berries oiled leather cinnamon and a hint of smoke. Rich slightly smoky cherry and berry notes on the palate plus milk chocolate and lively spices. Initially fruity then drying in the finish with wood smoke and light tannins."
5241,6,"One of the duo of releases in Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series ‘IPA’ was finished for 3 months in casks that previously held the Speyside Craft Brewery’s India pale ale. The nose offers hops and honey malt toffee cooking apples and lemon. Smooth on the palate with more honey and toffee soft spices and ultimately slightly bitter hoppy ale notes. The finish is medium in length with dry spices and plain chocolate."
5242,1,"More from Bruichladdich. The latest in the Elements series is clean in a freshly-showered kind of fashion. The fact that it’s backed up with bran agave syrup and pancake batter just helps to emphasize this image of a sunlit breakfast. The palate is sweet fat and juicy typical of how texture is as important as flavor with the Laddie. In time there’s some cinnamon with a preserved lemon acidity that enlivens the finish. £55 (500 ml)"
5243,1,"Full gold. Good cask interaction here allowing a light tropical fruit element to emerge alongside peach and apricot. Juicy and sweet in other words with none of the usual Tormore rigidity. The palate is equally concentrated showing some heat with a decent degree of fleshy elegance. Water brings out more dry elements: brown bracken hayloft. It begins to firm up but it is good enough to change folks’ minds about this distillery. £125"
5244,6,"Initially aged in bourbon barrels this expression was transferred into Cabernet Sauvignon wine casks in March 2011 for additional maturation. Musty wine notes on the early nose soon become red berries and vanilla. Supple on the palate with big red berry notes plus honey and ginger. Lingering ginger and raspberries in the finish drying to dark chocolate (2520 bottles) £70"
5245,6,"This 9 year old bottling has been fully matured in Caribbean rum barrels. Quite delicate on the nose with wet grass then emerging coconut and whipped cream. Slick on the palate with an instant tropical fruit hit—ripe banana and pineapple—plus more cream cinnamon and hazelnut. Spicy and nutty in the finish with a final tropical fruit tang (6600 bottles) £40"
5246,1,"Surprisingly punchy for its age there’s very little cask activity here so what you get is a reduction of Caol Ila into oils (lanolin) and whiffs of the harbor (drying fishing nets) rather than overt smokiness. The palate is gentle and shy with an unctuous feel that drifts into poached pear and light cream. Delicate but also oozing with character. Best neat."
5247,6,"The third and final release of the 1989 vintage of Northern Highland malt Balblair is on sale in Europe initially with U.S. availability (at approximately $95) this fall. Initially quite reticent on the nose with a hint of potato chips mild vanilla lemon and unripe bananas. Full and rounded on the palate; nutty with tropical fruits and lively spice. Medium length in the finish with apricots instant coffee and milky cocoa. £60"
5248,9,"Matured exclusively in ex-bourbon barrels (American white oak or quercus alba) and certified kosher. It’s a softer gentler version of Glenrothes. The bourbon oak influence is very evident showing creamy vanilla and coconut with additional fruit (orange creamsicle pineapple black raspberry blueberry and gooseberry). Soft creamy vanilla finish. A pleasant easy-going seamless dram—and perhaps the most approachable Glenrothes whisky."
5249,6,"Exclusively for the U.S. as an addition between the 10 and the 17 year old. Central to its composition is a ‘parcel’ of refill hogsheads to which a number of European oak butts have been added. Initially slightly herbal on the nose with developing fresh fruits and vanilla. Finally caramel and damp leaves underfoot. Full and confident on the palate with tropical fruits stem ginger and hazelnuts. Drying in the finish with spicy rich oak and creamy allspice."
5250,6,"New to Duncan Taylor’s Dimensions range is this single cask (#2927) cask strength offering from Perthshire’s Blair Athol distillery. Sweet and fruity on the nose majoring in tinned pineapple in syrup. Toffee nougat and a hint of freshly-dug soil make up the supporting aromatic cast. Full bodied and initially as sweet in the mouth as it was on the nose with vigorous spices particularly nutmeg then it begins to dry. The long finish is characterized by powdery cocoa and oak tannins. £80"
5251,9,"Aged on the Scottish mainland for 14 years and then finished off in sherry casks on the Island of Mull. A fresh whisky with a hint of brine along with richer nutty toffee and chocolate fudge embedded with dried fruit. Delicate oak resin peppers the finish balancing the whisky’s sweetness. One of the best unpeated Tobermory whiskies (i.e. non-Ledaig) whiskies I’ve tasted. The sherry enhances the whiskey without dominating."
5252,1,"I have a soft spot for the Braes: not only a forgotten part of Speyside but the only distillery whose roof I’ve stood on. Anyway here you have yeastiness and a smell like just-baked sugar-topped apple pie the fruit cracking through warm pastry. Sweet direct and slightly nervy Braes is never going to be a heavy hitter but this is the ideal dram to conjure up fading memories of summer."
5253,6,"Following on from Revival Glenglassaugh has released 6000 bottles of Evolution an expression also made after the distillery’s reopening in 2008. It has been matured in first-fill George Dickel barrels and bottled at cask strength. Peaches and gingerbread on the nose with brittle toffee icing sugar and vanilla. Luscious soft fruits dipped in caramel figure on the palate with coconut and background stem ginger. The finish is medium in length with spicy toffee.  £50"
5254,9,"Fruit is the common thread to this lightly peated whisky; red fruit that is. Red raspberry red currant red seedless grape strawberry and red apple. A gentle sweetness (creamy vanilla light molasses) balances all this fruit. Not overly contemplative but delightful. This is definitely  not the same Rocks I reviewed two years ago. It is richer darker in color and tastes more mature. It's an improved version and my rating reflects this."
5255,7,"An uncommon exclusive bottling of a 6 year old cask strength malt. Light gold in color the nose is vegetal more peat bog than peat smoke with an undercurrent of pastry cream and rose. It’s an odd combination of aromas. The entry is flavorful and inviting with smoked pineapple clove and rose. Peak smoke arrives in full force in the mid-palate which drops the sweet and becomes spicy. The finish is mostly smoke but with a pleasant minty coolness.  (Wyoming only)"
5256,1,"Pale straw. This is a classic young Caol Ila all elbows and knees. There is sweetness but it’s counteracted by this briny edge and an aroma like firelighters in among smoldering peat. Shut your eyes and it could be mezcal. The smoke envelops the palate while you pick out edible seaweed and smoked oyster on the tongue. Very bright and would make a good aperitif/highball. £50"
5257,6,"This single cask bottling from Langside Distillers was aged in a sherry butt and bottled in 2015. Candied orange peel on the early nose soft sweet sherry and glacé cherries. Fragrant with milk chocolate-coated Turkish Delight. Sweet spicy sherry plus pepper and cinnamon on the uncomplicated palate. Fruity spices in the medium-length finish. (222 bottles Robertsons of Pitlochry exclusive) £45"
5258,6,"The second release in the Custodians’ series was matured in two sherry hogsheads—one first-fill and the other second-fill. This 46 year old is presented at cask strength. The early nose offers herbal and menthol notes old resin citrus fruits then milk chocolate-coated peppermint creams… idiosyncratic. The palate is quite thin with more citrus fruits almonds and developing wood notes. The finish is lightly oaky and mouth-drying with a touch of black pepper."
5259,6,"Another recent addition to Aberdeenshire bottler Duncan Taylor’s Dimensions range launched late last year. The nose is very fruity with sliced peaches and apricots plus a porridge-like background note. Relatively full bodied and malty with intense fruit notes then dark spices appear. The finish is medium in length spicy with aniseed balls then a lingering creaminess at the very end. £42"
5260,6,"Distilled between October and March matured in American (first-fill and refill) and European oak casks; meant to be served ice-cold. From the freezer concentrated aromas of pineapple hints of honey and smoke. At room temperature less intense fruitiness more honey and ginger. A syrupy mouthfeel from the freezer with soft spices and orchard fruits. The palate is more complex at room temperature with heathery spice pepper apricots raisins and milk chocolate. The finish yields cocoa powder and lingering spices. £38"
5261,6,"Matured in bourbon casks this is the second release from the fledgling Caithness Distillery. Clearly youthful on the nose but not raw with ginger melon and background resin. Ultimately mildly floral. Chili notes on the relatively dry palate with nutmeg and spicy oak. The finish is on the short side of medium in length peppery and slightly bitter. Once decanted this dram improves significantly and is rated on that basis. (1200 bottles)£65"
5262,6,"This 2000 vintage expression from Glenturret was matured in refill sherry hogsheads before bottling in 2015 as part of Gordon & MacPhail’s “MacPhail’s Collection” range. The nose is earthy with vanilla treacle and dark berries plus fruit spices. Full-bodied in the mouth with spicy zesty plums raisins cocktail cherries and nutmeg. The finish is lengthy with black treacle cocoa powder and an edge of slightly bitter oak."
5263,6,"The bourbon cask-matured partner to the Sherry Matured bottling (see above) this expression similarly comprises a vatting of whisky distilled in 1973 1977 1988 1991 2002 and 2006. Both Contrasting Casks are offered in non-chill filtered format. Apple pie with buttery caramel milk chocolate and coconut on the nose. Zesty spices on the early palate then custard contrasting lemon and a note of char. Spicy fruits black pepper and more char in the finish. £100"
5264,9,"The first non-vintage Glenrothes in recent memory allowing the distillery more flexibility in cask selection when making a bottling. True to Glenrothes this expression is mouth-coatingly malty with well-integrated bright fruit notes creamy vanilla praline and honey. Nutty delicately spicy finish."
5265,9,"Fairly straight-forward but pleasing nonetheless. Creamy on the nose and palate. Nicely malty too with interwoven notes of vanilla caramel custard and hazelnut offset nicely by dry oak spices and a hint of peat. A calming whisky best enjoyed after a very stressful day."
5266,6,"Exclusive to North America this bottling was matured in bourbon hogsheads for 9 years and then finished in French oak casks for a further 3 years. The casks originally contained red wine from the Bacalhoa winery. Before use by Tomatin they underwent a de-char/re-char process. Peaches vanilla milk chocolate and ginger on the nutty nose with new-mown hay. Full-bodied with toffee apples black pepper and cloves. Lingering warm spices in the finish. (12000 bottles)"
5267,1,"Smoke comes at you immediately the morning-after smoke of a spent fire mixing with reeds and rushes a touch of coconut and light oak. Water is needed to bring out sweetness alongside the Band-Aid note typical of many young peaty whiskies. The palate is a lot sweeter than the nose suggests bold and quite thick; honey adding a sticky quality that then moves into creosote and antiseptic cream. It needs hefty degrees of dilution. A work in progress. £100"
5268,6,"This NAS cask strength expression of Tomatin was matured in a mix of bourbon and virgin American oak casks. The nose is sweet and fragrant with vanilla cinnamon and developing coconut ice. Silky on the palate initially softly spiced with vanilla toffee pears and apples; then the spices intensify introducing a hint of chili. Drying in the lengthy spicy slightly herbal finish. (282 bottles; exclusive to Robertson’s Pitlochry Perthshire) £55"
5270,6,"The latest release from Talisker is an NAS bottling which contains whisky matured in toasted and refill American oak casks. According to the distiller this is “An easy-drinking Talisker…more approachable but still definitely Talisker.” Certainly approachable on the nose with tangerines honey and milk chocolate before ozone and peat smoke develop. Ginger and a hint of coal tar. Medium-bodied with citrus fruit and increasingly hot spices though never overwhelming. Spicy peat white pepper and aniseed in a nutty finish. £33"
5271,6,"The nose is nutty and earthy with dry sherry cooking apples vanilla and emerging icing sugar. Finally a hint of sea salt. Silky in the mouth with lively spices Jaffa oranges muted sherry and mixed nuts. The finish is medium in length nutty with spice and persistent citrus fruit."
5272,6,"This single cask bottling of Clynelish from Wemyss Malts is 16 years old and just 302 bottles were yielded by the bourbon hogshead in which maturation took place. Milk chocolate orange and malt on the nose; fragrant with stem ginger. Zesty and notably spicy on the palate with applesauce peaches and digestive biscuits. Relatively long in the finish with oak allspice and persistent fruitiness.£67"
5273,6,"Dark Origins is a new addition to Highland Park’s core range inspired by the distillery’s founder Magnus Eunson. The recipe embraces twice as many first-fill sherry casks than that of Highland Park 12 year old. Chocolate malt caramel and ripe bananas on the nose with a whiff of coal dust. Silky on the palate with dry sherry autumn berries plus more coal and a spicy plain chocolate edge. Long and dry in the smoky finish with black pepper."
5274,6,"Distilled in 1985 this expression of Highland Park was matured in a single bourbon cask that yielded 252 bottles. Green apples tinned mandarin oranges linseed and a hint of smoky chocolate on the nose. Sweet spices coconut and mild peat smoke on the light palate. Lingering peat smoke root ginger and a touch of vanilla in the medium-length finish. £120"
5275,12,"If you aren’t expecting it the herbaceous grassy mineral aromas are a surprise more expected in an agave spirit than a typical Speysider. But there’s something entrancing about the herbal flavors of tarragon licorice tea chestnut honey and saline which resolve into a lightly sweet slightly spiced finish. This is unusual but beguiling. (Trader Joe’s)"
5276,6,"Selected by distillery manager Douglas Campbell currently in his 50th year at Tomatin. It has been matured in a combination of American and European oak casks and just 200 cases have been released. Citrus fruits on the nose notably oranges and apricots with a hint of damp soil. More fruit on the palate orange wine gums ginger and gentle oak. Long and slowly drying in the finish with encroaching aniseed and tannins."
5277,6,"Morrison Bowmore distillers has recently released a virgin oak-matured expression of its Auchentoshan single malt which has no age statement. The North American oak casks have been charred prior to receiving this Lowland whisky as their first fillings. The result is a nose of Madeira cinnamon vanilla and white pepper. Very spicy on the palate with citrus fruits and plain chocolate. Lingering in the finish with cocoa powder icing sugar; becoming slightly more bitter with time."
5278,9,"Amber-gold colored (not as dark as the other Beltramo’s offering here) with notes of caramel honey heather and bright fruit evolving into gentle cinnamon vanilla and ginger. Soft finish. A Highland Park for a lazy afternoon. (Bottled for Beltramo’s Fine Wines & Spirits)"
5279,6,"Cadenhead is responsible for this veteran cask strength release distilled in 1977 at the now-demolished distillery of Littlemill located a couple of miles from Auchentoshan. The nose is sweet with icing sugar vanilla honey and peaches. Damp grass after a while. Initially sweet and full on the palate slightly resinous with marzipan and sherbet then quite bitter oak kicks in. The marzipan and tannins fight it out in the finish. £175"
5280,1,"Here’s a rarity. A major player in Ballantine’s this Moray coast distillery is rarely seen in single malt guise. Very gentle sweet and juicy start with licks of cream a hint of barley and the gentle grassiness typical of the distillery. In time light almond and fresh lemon. The palate is lightly sticky — Glenburgie for its lightness always shows good succulence — with buttery vanilla malt and a touch of toasty oak. Gentle sweet and refreshing."
5281,10,"It will soon be 120 years since this workhorse of a distillery came into being. Golden Grahams sanded oak whole lemon floral blooms and cumin seeds on the nose but the whole confection is rather restrained. The palate is sweet but could be too sweet for some; Scottish tablet caramel ripe banana granulated sugar and ginger loaf. Some late heat accompanies the sugary finish. Remember to brush your teeth before bed."
5282,9,"Light to medium in body but quite flavorful. Firm spice notes and subtle brine (both of which are often found in Northern Highland malts) makes the whisky fresh and quite lively. There’s a soothing mouth-coating toffee sweetness providing balance and depth. This is the first distillery bottling of Balblair available here in the U.S. in a long time and it is very welcomed."
5283,9,"Style: Islay single malt scotch Color: Pale straw Aroma: Peat smoke-lots of it. Damp earth. Hint of olives and seaweed. Palate: Surprisingly gentle in texture and on the light side of medium in body. A malty sweetness balances the dry-ish peat smoke. Again the damp earth mid palate. An appetizing saltiness emerges towards the finish but is fleeting. Smoky finish."
5284,9,"If you’re looking for a bold dry spicy Speysider this is the one. There’s lots of oak here with bourbon undertones. A fighting vanilla sweetness manages to keep the whisky from becoming too austere. Gritty texture with cedar wood clove spearmint anise herbal notes dried fruit and dark chocolate. A whisky that awakens the palate. Very invigorating. (Exclusive to The Whisky Exchange London.)  Price: approximately $100."
5285,1,"This year’s Ardbeg Day bottling is named in tribute to World Cup host Brazil’s national colors: Auri (Gold) and Verdes (Green). Very restrained to start: grassy sweet with vanilla pod shoreline and smoke wrapped in a woolen blanket. The palate shows more smoke light chocolate Ardbeg oiliness and soot. It’s fresh and charming but ultimately is a quarterfinalist beaten on penalties."
5286,6,"The 11 year old triple distilled Lowland single malt in this bottling has been matured entirely in French oak casks that previously contained Bordeaux wine then bottled at cask strength. The nose offers contrasting sweet and sour fruit notes red grapes and gooseberries damp newspaper warm stone and vanilla. Herbal with cloves and spearmint. Mouth-coating bittersweet on the palate with molasses and — inevitably — red wine. Dark chocolate raisins and aniseed in the drying finish."
5390,1,"Bottled at 350ml. as a pair with a Spanish oak version (and probably sold out at source) here you get the merest glimpse of Macallan’s meatiness (shepherd’s pie) before flowers and apple blossom take charge. Lifted yes but never delicate. Water brings out cereal and mealy pudding with barley sugar on the end. £350"
5287,1,"Since its reopening eleven years ago this year Bruichladdich has been growing barley on Islay—a laudable move. This glimpse into the developing program shows what seems initially to be a delicately fragile dram that soon reveals an intense sweet depth behind the spring flowers. This purity of intent continues on the palate with a thick creaminess that’s typical of the distillery while a tart finish adds interest. Precocious but already beautifully balanced. £38"
5288,6,"This is the second batch of Arran 12 year old in cask strength format and it contains a higher percentage of sherry cask-matured whisky than the first. The out-turn is just over 13000 bottles. Fresh and sweet on the nose after an initial note of resin with oats and hot butter. Full-bodied syrupy and sweet on the palate with apricots ripe bananas nutmeg and walnuts. The finish majors in plain chocolate maraschino cherries and a suggestion of smoky sherry."
5289,1,"Plenty of the distillery’s fresh fruits here with some Demerara sugar sprinkled on the top a little hint of almond peppermint candied apple and hard fruit sweets. The palate continues in the same vein with some more apple (baked this time) and a chalky texture. Water allows it to become more creamy (think orange barley water) while a green fresh note emerges in the background. Just slightly bitter behind."
5290,1,"What you look for in a finished whisky is for some of the distillery's character to be apparent but also enhanced. Benrinnes is a big meaty dram which suits sherry and its feral aspect is there. Think of roast beef with damson jam date and blackberry. The palate is thick with licorice sweetness and a bitter edge. It has power and while you can see the join between original spirit and finish it’s a pretty happy match. £60/500 ml"
5291,9,"Finished in a pedro ximinez cask. This is the sweetest and most tactile of the three whiskies. Peat smoke married with lush notes of sultana ripe peaches pineapple white chocolate shortbread and thick honey. Delicate floral notes (heather lavender) add finesse. I expected a darker personality with the sherry finish. I was pleasantly surprised."
5292,6,"Einar was joint Earl of Orkney from 1014 and this bottling moves the Warrior Series slightly further into familiar Highland Park territory. Some gentle smoke on the nose with fresh newsprint ginger caramel and a hint of halibut oil. Peat smoke vanilla and citrus fruit on the palate. A little peat smoke in the medium-length finish. €53/liter"
5293,1,"The initial nose is soft fruits doused in condensed milk which contributes to an overall impression of light toffee and weirdly for this distillery in its contemporary guise some smoke. The fruits manage to mix the ripe and slightly sour. Quite intense; it needs water which calms proceedings allowing typical Glen Grant purity to come through. The fruits now have some added weight and again that smokiness. Intriguing! £75"
5294,9,"A peated version of Benriach that was also finished in a port pipe. There is a really nice blend of flavors here; a sweet malty foundation layered with ripe red fruit notes (raspberry strawberry preserve currant) and a firm blanket of smoke that goes on and on. All the flavors are bold but they’re equally balanced. Not a subtle whisky but quite entertaining. (Binny’s Beverage Depot exclusive)"
5295,1,"A new addition to the core range this shows Glen Grant with a little more weight but just a little. I’ve never been one for the heavily-sherried versions. Here the distillery’s signature green elements—spring flowers fresh apple and pear notes are given a little added weight—apple syrup toffee and cooked fruits on the palate. If you’d like an alternative to Glenlivet or Glenfddich 12 then look no further. £43"
5296,9,"The oldest of the group and it shows. When compared to younger expressions there’s less peaches and more citrus (lemon tangerine). It is thicker on the palate-with notes of fat barley and crème brulee-before dry resinous oak notes intensify. Dry spicy finish. Not as even-keeled as younger expressions but quite dynamic."
5297,9,"A “branded” malt meaning we don’t know which distillery this whisky came from. Fresh and quite fruity (peach nectarine golden raisin orange pineapple) with a nice underlying honey vanilla and caramel sweetness. Soft gentle malty finish. It’s clean nicely balanced and pleasant."
5298,6,"Finished principally in Pedro Ximenez Spanish sherry casks Tullibardine 500 Sherry has a fragrant nose with new leather beeswax apple and vanilla. The palate is smooth and sherried with more leather brittle toffee orange peel honey and nutmeg. The fruity finish is notably spicy with lingering wood polish notes."
5299,9,"Amber color. Rich malty aroma with notes of vanilla honey oak and floral undertones. Thick mouth-coating texture. Flavors are big and malty with notes of honey and vanilla up front then becoming rather dry with oak and subtle citrus. Huge long dry finish."
5300,6,"As with Rosebank Douglas Laing & Co. Ltd. has made a habit of releasing single malts from the now-demolished distillery of Littlemill which formerly stood not far from Auchentoshan. The latest variant was distilled in November 1991 and bottled early in 2012. The nose is fresh and fruity with vanilla and boiled sweets. Sweetly spicy on the straightforward palate with ginger to the fore. Spice continues through the finish with a hint of cedar. £157"
5301,9,"Pale gold color. Aromas reminiscent of a holiday spice cake-ginger cinnamon honey and a touch of citrus fruit. Medium bodied but it coats the palate-there's some viscosity here. The flavors are rather soothing and very much like its aroma with a malty sweetness throughout and a lingering finish.
   Style: Highland single malt Scotch whisky. Price: high $80s. Limited availability. 
   The owners of Blair Athol have chosen not to export this whisky to the U.S. For this reason it can be rather difficult to find only occasionally being imported by one of the independent bottlers. This particular expression is a very good example from this distillery."
5302,1,"Some single malts just suit specific cask types. Such is the case with Bunnahabhain and sherry. The spirit has a soft and nutty undertow plus a gingery note that is given weight and depth by the cask. Amontillado with its nuttier character is an ideal bridge between the two. This shows surprising maturity with more oxidized and mulch aromas alongside coffee grounds and a character that’s drifting into meaty. Brooding medium-bodied slightly dry…but the price? Ouch! (Fèis Ìle 2016 250 bottles) £250"
5303,1,"This vatting of three virgin oak casks and one oloroso butt was so keenly priced that it sold out in seconds all 1500 bottles of it. It shows Bowmore that ever-changing elusive Islay dram in perfumed scented mode. I picked up vetiver (an integral part of classic male cologne) but also peach some flamed peels and plenty of smoke. The palate dips into the sea for a second then again becomes scented alongside gentle chocolate. Amazing price too. £55"
5304,1,"In style this is closest to the 1978 in its levels of sweetness. Here though there is added key lime pie juicy white peaches and whipped cream alongside that deep Glenfarclas roasted ‘polished brass’ note. The medium-weight palate is pure and sweet with light orchard fruits. The most freshly acidic of the selection with a hint of flowers on the very end. £430"
5305,1,"This example of the little-seen Glentauchers immediately shows classic distillery character which is in the green grassy camp. This verdant aspect continues into fresh fruit salad with enough ripeness to indicate the time spent in cask. This mix of freshness and weight extends onto the tongue although the impact fades soon after a light spicy tingle on the back palate. I’d happily have a couple."
5306,9,"Aged exclusively in first-fill casks (60% of it sherry cask) and its oak intensity shows. Sweet but with a steady dose of dried spice oak resin and teasing tobacco to back it up. Silky texture and lush with fallen orchard fruit tangerine chocolate-covered orange and lemon meringue. A firm dried spice finish rounds it all out. Sort of like The Dalmore 12 year old pumped up on steroids."
5307,1,"The mix of honey citrus fruit and malt which sits at Balvenie’s core is beginning to deepen. The citrus fruits for example are becoming concentrated the honey is set clover the fruits moving into cooked apricot and banana. Rounded and thick in the mouth where the honeyed aspects and fleshiness of the fruits take control before a bloom of bridal bouquet. Tremendously complex here’s Balvenie's flowering into mid-period maturity. The price is…scary! £700"
5308,1,"Very sweet with thick hard toffee stewing dates and figs molasses and rum raisin ice cream before some dark chocolate dried mint and orange peel. The palate is a different beast. It ignites on the tongue with a burst of dried pepper flakes beneath which are cocktail bitters: gentian calamus. It begs for water when out comes black currant jam (very Aberlour) and a little malt. Now it’s calm and hugely drinkable and therefore even more dangerous."
5309,1,"Pale straw. Delicate and a little akin to chilled manzanilla sherry: fresh almond salinity light yeast. Vibrant with the smoke held in check. The palate is much sweeter with finally some cask-derived sugars beginning to show. Then it rushes to the shoreline and takes a gulp of water giving an effect like saltwater taffy. It needs water to flesh the palate out. £60/500 ml"
5310,1,"Huge marzipan/almond notes greet you on the first sniff. This then moves into an aroma like crepe bandage and even a hint of ointment then lychee and some maltiness. The palate is surprisingly feisty with a little orange. Water brings out mash tun aromas and a pleasing whiff of sheep pens. When diluted the palate is very pretty with the almond returning. Easy drinking. £80"
5311,1,"Another blast of new oak. Fat and creamy with distinct charred elements along with stewing pineapple banana fritters white chocolate suntan oil and a melting bar of nut-filled milk chocolate. An instructive dram showing how maturity is very different from age. With water some of the distillery finally pokes through. To be honest it’s slightly too much for me; like overdosing on cotton candy or sugar-topped donuts. £54"
5312,6,"The eighth edition of heavily-peated Edradour bottled under the Ballechin label is part of the distillery’s Discovery Series and has been aged in Sauternes wine casks. The nose yields sweet fruity smoke cocoa and spice. Sweet and soft on the palate with more fruity smoke notably pineapple-influenced with a hint of smoked fish. The finish is medium to long with ashy peat and slightly bitter citrus fruits."
5313,6,"Glenglassaugh distillery launched both unpeated and peated expressions matured in octave casks approximately one-eighth the capacity of a butt. They have not been subjected to chill-filtration. The nose of this unpeated Classic is sweet with ripe apples peaches toffee and buttery spice. Smooth on the palate with more peaches and now intense spiciness followed by vanilla aniseed licorice new oak and mild cloves in the long slightly citric finish. £55"
5314,9,"This expression is atypical for a Macallan whisky-the standard Macallan line is aged in sherry casks while this one is aged in a bourbon cask. Absent the sherry this isn’t as sweet or rich. Rather it’s more delicate and gentle. The whisky is very clean and creamy with lovely floral notes (lavender heather rose) intertwined with spices (especially vanilla) and fruit (baked apple pineapple coconut). Delicate pleasing finish. One of the better non-sherried whiskies distilled at Macallan. (Bottled exclusively for retailer Wine on the 9.)"
5315,6,"Distilled in 1994 and matured in a single hogshead this 21 year old expression is part of Wemyss Malts’ 2016 Midsummer Single Cask Release. Rich stewed fruits honey and allspice on the pleasing nose. Voluptuous on the palate with spicy apple and cranberry. The finish dries quite rapidly to aniseed and spicy oak. (220 bottles) £100"
5316,4,"Springbank’s tasting room bottling of its triple-distilled malt will not disappoint any fan of the official bottling; all its rounded and honeyed characteristics are firmly in evidence here. The nose is soft and sweet with praline and a touch of condensed sweet malt joining creamed vanilla. Without water the malt is surprisingly robust and prickly. Dilute it though and it’s a very pleasant drink with crystallized grapefruit traces of hickory and menthol some honey and sweet candy. Later on spice comes through and the finish is long fruity and spicy. An interesting take but not a radical departure from the official bottling."
5317,4,"Without water this is an aggressive malt sharp and acerbic. With water it’s still more in your face than any official bottling. Where you tend to associate Caol Ila with oily peaty and maritime characteristics this is altogether more feisty and ballsier with a glance to the big three peaty distilleries in the south of Islay and even a nod to its peppery cousin on Skye. On the nose there is peat but it is tempered by dark chocolate; some citrus there too. The taste is quite sharp with bitter lemon licorice and sooty peat to the fore. Certainly an interesting take on this intriguing distillery and far removed from last year’s relatively gentle 25 year old release but there are questions over the balance and whether it’s a better whisky is a moot point."
5318,4,"This distillery-only bottling strips away the sweet gloopiness of the standard 12 year old — and is all the better for that. The nose is soft and gentle with rose petals and rose hips over a base of ripe plum and a touch of ginger cake. The palate is intriguing and holds the attention with citrus fruits bitter apple spice and a touch of peppermint. It is all very clean sophisticated and pleasant. The finish is long and warming and the overall experience is highly enjoyable. Justified as a distillery-only bottling? Without a doubt."
5355,9,"Big and smoky but with a rich balancing malty underbelly. Tarry rope leafy bonfire rooty peat burnt licorice smoked seaweed coal ash and vanilla-tinged malt all with emerging brine subtle Spanish olive and a hint of ginger. A robust yet well-rounded Islay-style whisky with a pleasing oily texture though I do wish it had a higher strength for a little more attitude."
5319,1,"Sadly the final chapter in a series which deservedly acquired cult status because of the way it showed how well Bowmore behaved in close proximity to sherry casks. This was aged in oloroso and PX and has a thick dark nose all dried black fruits and saddlebags. The smoke is sotto voce. The savory nature continues on the palate. It needs water to bring out fresh fruits and while there’s a bitterness on the end that’s a minor cavil. £190"
5320,1,"There have been some legendary Hart Brothers bottlings of Bowmore (the 1966 bottled in ’74 is a classic) so this has a lot to live up to. The nose is creamy and discreet but Bowmore is less about charging out wreathed in smoke and more a dram where peat is part of the totality. Here you get seashells and low-tide aromas along with green banana. The palate is gently smoked with light barley cool melon. An afternoon dram. £50"
5321,1,"Brought back as a celebration of the distillery’s 200th anniversary and in the vein of other 15 year old expressions is somewhat restrained. Rather than big phenols there’s an aroma of lanolin sautéed scallop fleshy fruit and real sweetness. The palate shoes some oozing oils and a whiff of creosote but this is a tea party rather than a wild ceilidh. Maybe bottling at 46% would have given the drive that’s missing."
5322,6,"This peated expression from Tobermory distillery has been aged in refill remade hogsheads. The nose offers earthy peat citrus fruit vanilla and smoked haddock in butter. Big sweet peat notes on the peppery palate with marshmallows and lively spices. The spices linger to the close with peat embers and a hint of brine on the lips. £60"
5323,6,"This 19 year old example of Glen Garioch from 1993 offers a nose of orange blossom sherry and milk chocolate becoming sweeter with time. Finally butterscotch mousse. Sweet and fruity on the palate with cherries icing sugar and a hint of smoky caramel. Medium to long in the finish with persistent citrus notes cinnamon nutmeg and ginger. (U.S. only)"
5324,6,"While most Wemyss Malts’ releases are named after flavor descriptors this one adopts a well-known Shakespearean reference. A sherry butt filled in 2002 gave an out-turn of 854 bottles. The nose offers toffee bonbons coffee with condensed milk and finally farmyard aromas. The palate is relatively sweet with spicy sherry notes and contrasting mildly citric fruit plus a slight earthiness. The finish is medium to long with lingering spice and a carry-over of coffee from the nose. £57"
5325,6,"Bottled in 2015 this expression from Arran distillery was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. Ripe apple and tinned peaches on the early nose icing sugar a hint of mint and soft toffee. Lively spices and pear drops on the palate with vanilla and cocoa. The finish is medium in length with a twist of lemon and cocoa powder."
5326,6,"Aberfeldy distillery has added a 16 year old expression to its core range positioned between the existing 12 and 21 year old variants. This newcomer has been finished in oloroso sherry casks and the result is a pleasing if undemanding dram with a fresh sweet sherried nose featuring orange honey and ginger. Smooth on the palate with more oranges marzipan then milk chocolate and gentle spices. Nutty spice increasingly bitter orange and dark chocolate in the finish. £62"
5327,6,"A 22 year old Glencadam; maturation took place in a refill American oak hogshead. The nose offers rich honey and malt notes though slightly balsamic. Syrup-like on the palate heathery and spicy with more honey. Relatively long and spicy in the finish with chili though honey persists right to the end. (U.S. only)"
5328,6,"Originally exclusive to the Swedish market this expression was selected by Highland Park’s Danish brand ambassador Martin Markvardsen. Matured in a combination of 70% bourbon barrels and 30% oloroso sherry casks. Waxy and malty on the early nose with fresh earth damp moss vanilla and honey. Gentle peat on the palate more earthy notes; herbal with lime and salt. The finish is quite short showing apricots slight peatiness allspice."
5329,9,"Lightweight with a slightly oily texture. Appetizingly fresh and briny on the palate with underlying notes of hay lime vanilla-tinged malt and a hint of seaweed on the finish. A mouth-watering aperitif."
5330,6,"An 18 year old single malt for just $33 should set alarm bells ringing. But this sherry-finished Kirkland expression from an undisclosed distillery is definitely a decent dram at a bargain-basement price. Initially slightly vegetal and earthy on the nose developing a warm leatheriness with sherry figs melon skin and caramel. Silky on the palate with milk chocolate emerging hazelnuts sweet sherry and honey. The finish is medium in length with spicy orange and mocha coffee notes."
5331,6,"Arran distillery has been making peated batches of spirit since 2004 and this NAS bottling is the fifth release of that spirit peated to 20 ppm. The outturn is 12000 bottles. Nutty peat spicy malt toffee and lemon on the mildly savory nose. Vibrant on the palate with lots of citrus fruit. A bonfire smokiness develops steadily with spice nuts and plain chocolate through to the relatively long finish which features a persistent citric note."
5332,6,"The nose offers less rich peachy fruit than the 12 year old. More perfumed with toasted marshmallows. Silky and sweet on the palate with tinned pears and pineapple plus developing toffee and oak. The finish is quite long with persistent ginger drying slightly. £77"
5333,1,"A venerable bottling from its proprietor and there’s no doubt from the nose that you’re dealing with an ultra-mature whisky. Like going in to meet your aged grandfather who is sitting in his library surrounded by old books with a little sunlight filtering through the drapes. In time there’s dried peach and envelope gum. The palate is wooded and concentrated but it is dry and lacking in the required energy. Water stirs it into life but kills the flavor. £450"
5334,9,"Finished in Madeira casks. An interesting contrast to the 15 year old. This one is more challenging than soothing (and quite dry too -- especially on the palate) with dominant red fruit (currant raspberry strawberry) plum baked cinnamon apple polished leather bourbon almonds and just the hint of smoke and brine. Dry resinous finish. An intense Laddie."
5335,9,"A departure from the first edition of Bruichladdich 20 year old and very Glenmorangie-esque-given that it was aged for five weeks in Mourvedre wine casks before being bottled. The wine influence is evident both in appearance (a pinkish hue) its palate (berry fruits) and even its nickname (""flirtation""). It is quite a sweet Bruichladdich with chewy toffee ripe berries background pit fruits and earthy/ resinous spicy notes-especially on the finish. A Bruichladdich fresh Islay sea breeze character fights its way through but it is a struggle."
5336,9,"Aged in a used bourbon barrel. Rather soft for Bowmore — especially for its age — with a gentle foundation of honey vanilla and malt. Interwoven notes of summer fruit coconut lime and gentle peat with teasing brine and smoke on the finish. A straightforward unpretentious pleasant Bowmore."
5338,1,"A catch-up rather than a new release but a fascinating contrast to the 14 year old Flora & Fauna bottling. Yes there’s apple blossom but here there’s more medlar fruit syrups raspberry and an intriguing play between vanilla and lightly oxidized nuttiness. Linkwood’s substance is shown on the palate where an oily feel adds texture to the lush dried fruits and saffron-led spiciness. Best neat. An elegant dram."
5339,1,"The second bottling from Bruichladdich in this range shows the ‘traditional‘ side of a distillery that is famed for the variety of its expressions. This in other words is Bruichladdich in its sweet honeyed gentle guise partnered with American oak to produce a mashed banana character an unctuous palate and a light touch of almond on the finish. Lovely. £55 (500 ml)"
5340,1,"The first thing to note is the strength. It’s surprisingly not that hot initially rather there are hints of soft orchard fruits gentle smoke and seashells. With water the fruits show up—mango and peach—but the alcohol is still masking things. Water goes in immediately to produce a palate that is cool slightly sweet with seashore notes wet stones and those fruits but there’s still a real tension to the whole experience. For the brave. £110"
5341,1,"Second of this pair of limited editions from Glenfiddich. This was named after a number of the distillery’s warehouse roofs collapsed under the weight of snow in 2010. This was a bottling of a selection of casks — ex-sherry ex-bourbon refill — from one of those damaged warehouses. It is gentle and sweet — cooked pear fruit crumble topped with rolled oats golden syrup and on the palate hints of raisin. A lemon finish adds a freshness to a dangerously drinkable dram."
5342,1,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. The youngest of the quintet has been aged in refill sherry hogsheads but the coconut that immediately assails the nostrils suggests they were made from American oak. Alongside this is the distillery’s signature pineapple note which sits under a scented floral lift. Water adds a further layer of ripe pear. The palate is equally heightened with a powdery feel. It’s pretty discreet and I’d be cautious with any dilution. The finish is a mix of night-scented stocks custard and green apple. £95"
5343,6,"Unusually Wemyss Malts simultaneously offered two single cask bottlings of Clynelish in October 2014 both distilled in 1997 and matured in hogsheads. ‘Bench with a Sea View’ provided an out-turn of 371 bottles. The nose is sweet and fruity with green apples and chocolate mousse. Slightly oily on the palate with black pepper salt and orchard fruits. Persistently peppery in the finish with citrus fruit oak a hint of brine and cocoa. £68"
5344,6,"A 15 year old Glen Garioch which is unique as the first from the distillery to be fully matured in French Bordeaux wine casks. The casks in question are tonneaux de vin rouge from Saint-Julien and distillation took place on June 23 1998. Just 450 cases are available globally. Sweet berries on the early nose with milk chocolate ginger and spicy oak. Malt ginger plums and honey on the rich palate while the long finish offers spicy malt and honey."
5345,6,"This 17 year old refill hogshead-matured expression of Dalmore was distilled in May 1997 and 237 bottles have been released. It is an interesting example of Dalmore uncut without the proprietary sherry maturation-spin usually put on it. The nose is sweet with caramel tinned peaches and pineapple and a smearing of honey. Zesty spices open the palate which becomes nutty with Jaffa oranges gingery oak and dark chocolate. Long and warming in the finish with more oak and plain chocolate. £78"
5346,1,"A typical Rothes nose with vanilla granola apple Brazil nut lemon and
low-level sweet spices mixing with lightly oxidized fruits. That said it needs
water especially for the palate where the malty crispness of the undiluted
taste is replaced by something more considered darkly fruity and gently spicy;
coriander is uppermost. All in all this is Rothes in very approachable rather
than dynamic guise. One for a lazy afternoon."
5347,9,"One of a series of single cask wine-finished Caol Ilas. This one is finished in a claret (Bordeaux) wine cask. The claret adds some bright red fruit notes (raspberry red currant) and red licorice to accompany the smoke brine olive and vanilla-laced malt. I have tasted some claret/Bordeaux wood-finished whiskies where the wine was too dominant but this one achieves a nice balance."
5348,6,"Distilled in February 2005. Earthy peat brine vanilla cereal and a hint of cinnamon on the confident nose. Finally wood smoke. Lively in the mouth with nutty spices and pipe tobacco while peat briefly takes a back seat before reasserting itself. Ginger and peat embers in the medium-length finish. (Whisky Shop only) £35/500 ml"
5349,9,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Pale gold Aroma: Surprisingly fresh and clean. Golden raisins lightly oaky. Malted barley. Palate: Beautifully balanced and clean. Layers of fruit interwoven through a richly malty foundation. Long and clean on the finish with a hint of dry oaky spiciness."
5350,9,"Very pale in color suggesting it was aged in a used bourbon cask. One nosing confirms it. A fairly light fresh and appetizing whisky with notes of brine mustard seed and delicate honeyed vanilla. Slightly oily in texture. Seaweed with suggestions of ginger and bourbon on the finish. An aperitif whisky or with sushi perhaps? (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot.)"
5351,1,"Longmorn is one of Speyside’s fruit bombs something which remains true here even if in slightly paler guise than usual. Instead of ripe autumn fruits here you get kiwi William pear green plum even green tomato and a faint blossom reminiscent of the almond notes of sakura (cherry blossom). I’d keep water well away such is this light lacy Longmorn’s fragility. £73"
5352,9,"Aged in bourbon and sherry casks and then finished off in oloroso sherry casks for two years. The sherry provides a good measure of lush fruit brown sugar and a slick texture on the palate. The sherry is clean and uncluttered if somewhat overshadowing the traditional Deanston honeyed malt foundation. I’m also picking up some burnt marmalade lemongrass and ginger. Soft sweet fruity finish."
5353,9,"This Highlander is Lowland-ish in style but with more heft. There’s soft barley sweetness notes of vanilla and orange creamsicle. Grassy notes emerge from time to time. It is clean and very drinkable. An ideal aperitif but could be enjoyed anytime between dawn and dinner. Whoever said whisky was an after-dinner drink never tasted this whisky."
5354,9,"A mouth-coating -- almost chewy -- Glen Elgin chock full of toffee nut paste heather-honey and a hint of milk chocolate. The richness is brightened with ginger and mandarin orange making for a pleasurable soothing experience."
5356,9,"I don’t normally like to add water to old whiskies but this one needs a little at this strength. Whether you will like this whisky or not depends on whether you like woody whiskies with lots of sherry and whether you care at all about recognizing the distillery character. The flavors are nicely balanced rich and very soothing in nature but I struggle to find Glen Grant in here. Ripe fallen fruit chewy toffee maple syrup honey-glazed almonds damp oak resins-it’s all there and it’s all balanced and quite entertaining. I personally want to taste the distillery character in my whisky. If that didn’t matter to me I would have given this whisky a higher score."
5357,9,"Like many older Glen Grant offerings this one is from a sherry cask. The sherry and the long oak aging transforms what is normally a light and easy drinking whisky to a more serious affair. Ripe heavy fruit dominate the palate-the sherry is very evident here but it is not cloying. It’s quite nutty too along with polished oak and toffee. The oak balances the sherry notes very nicely and the whisky is clean and uncomplicated throughout all the way through to its finish."
5358,9,"A replacement to the original 10 year old which is now off the market. A clean straightforward dram with a lightness and freshness which is very inviting. Notes of vanilla cream light caramel tropical fruit (coconut pineapple) clementine pear and a hint of currant. Appetizing subtly briny finish."
5359,9,"Matured in a “rejuvenated American oak” cask. “ Tropical fruit” is the operative descriptor here. Bananas in cream honey-kissed citrus (lime clementine) papaya mango a hint of coconut green tea and gentle vanilla. Soft finish. Rather exotic. Almost tries too hard to be cool. Distinctive but I could tire of it sooner than the others here. (246 bottles) £200"
5360,9,"Finished in a rum cask. Gold with a greenish tinge. Notes of ripe barley demerara sugar toasted marshmallow and sultana with underlying vanilla and subtle brine emerging on the finish. A pleasant easy-going Laddie. (Bottled for Bayway World of Liquor)"
5361,9,"An interesting whisky with flavor notes I wouldn’t normally find together-golden raisins green grapes plum citrus tang fresh ginger almonds and a hint of mint leaves all wrapped by a pleasing maltiness with underlying notes of vanilla custard. Fairly dry slightly hot finish. Many of the Glendronachs (especially from the distillery) are sherried. Some of the sherried versions like the 33 year old are excellent. However this is a refreshing change of pace. I’m glad they bottled it when they did though as any additional oak dryness would be detrimental."
5362,9,"Clean fragrant and quite fruity with notes of tangerine lemon pineapple and kiwi. There's a creamy-almost oily-vanilla maltiness on the palate that binds the fruit together. Gently dry subtly spicy finish. A pleasing unpretentious whisky."
5363,9,"A new expression in the portfolio. Quite fruity with prominent honey-tinged citrus peel nutty toffee nougat and vanilla fudge leading to a gripping firm dry oak resin finish. Deeper and bolder than the 12 year old expression."
5364,9,"Very frail. Don’t add any water to this whisky as its flavors seem to crumble. It’s a subtle whisky too -- one has to tease the flavors out of it. But when you do with some focus you’ll find fragrant notes of dried spice malty vanilla citrus peal and elegant floral notes. Surprisingly the whisky is not overly dry and woody on the palate. The initial impression of this whisky is that it’s too tired and past its prime. With continued exploration and patience its subtle pleasures emerge."
5365,1,"Diageo’s Singleton range is its answer to the problem of how to build a global single malt brand when each distillery will ultimately be limited by its capacity. Answer? A single brand: ‘Singleton’ but from three distilleries each focused on a different area of the world. Singleton of Dufftown is Europe’s expression and this 15 year old combines cake mix peanut butter and fleshy fruits. There’s dried banana and vanilla on the palate and a nutty sweet finish. £38 (Not available in the U.S.)"
5366,1,"The U.S. Singleton comes from Glendullan a distillery that makes a sweet light spirit. Here a percentage has been aged in ex-sherry casks which has added a layer of fruity sweetness — think port-like sloe notes Muscatel and wisteria. The wood is lightly handled allowing the aromas full rein on the palate."
5367,1,"The news that there’s a new distillery being built on the Imperial site is something to be celebrated. One hopes that the new plant makes whisky of the same character as the old because Imperial is a classic single malt which is about fragrance (here pineapple and toasted marshmallows) and a clinging seductive cream soda quality. Whiskies like these are poems they need you to concentrate. This is a touch rigid but that’s a minor criticism of a gorgeous dram.  £60"
5368,1,"One in a trio from Chivas Bros. who every year release limited editions of 500 ml cask strength bottlings from a selection of its estates. These are predominantly only for sale on site or by mail order through www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com.

Miltonduff was licensed in 1824 and these days is also an important blender’s malt with a little more oily depth than its neighbor Glenburgie. This has a deep floral bouquet — think iris and lily — and aromatic fruits like quince. With water there’s moss sage and orange peel. The fruity character is dominant in the mouth and becomes more tropical; there’s even some coconut on the finish. £40"
5369,1,"Soft fruits are to the fore here; think of cooking green plums fruit syrup a hint of sultana to add to the sweetness and then a hint of beeswax. There’s even a little of Macallan’s occasional earthiness here akin to the damp sand floor of a sherry bodega. This is the transition point in the range with a similar weight to Gold but greater sweetness and the beginnings of Macallan’s mysterious savory edge. Have neat with water or ice. £45"
5370,1,"Clean with the warming sensual aroma of yeasty freshness that you get from freshly-baked bread. Stir in some almond butter a little hay. The palate shows that it has substance behind this very open nose. Here is thickness tongue-clinging oils and a vibrant lemon note bringing to mind boiled travel sweets before the dry maltiness comes through. With water — and it’s best lightly diluted — we’re looking at pastries. £36"
5371,1,"The aim here was to recreate the style of malt made by George Smith but rather than running peated malt Chivas Bros. has aged the spirit in Islay casks (not what George would have done). On the upside this is a classic Nadurra: estery fruits with pineapple to the fore freesia pear and fresh apple the smoke giving subtle gun-flint notes to the palate. I like it as a dram but it’s wimped out of what was intended. Marked accordingly."
5389,1,"As this is slightly closed when neat you have to search for Glen Grant’s classic apple notes behind a tense nose which even with water remains inward-looking. Thankfully this changes on the tongue with pure very linear (typical of GG) flavors of cool mint cucumber basil and yes apple. Easy-going from a relaxed cask but with more substance than you’d expect."
5372,9,"From the Balmenach distillery. (The previous bottling of this whisky was from a sherry cask. This one is from a bourbon cask.) Mouth-coating in texture. Ripe barley and malty up front ultimately transitioning to a clinging dryness towards the finish. Notes of vanilla cream toasted coconut marshmallow cut grass honeydew melon and lemon/lime. A pleasant textural whisky. (Bottling at 46% and not chill-filtered enhances this.) My question: why sherry cask or bourbon cask? I think a marriage of both types of cask would add more dimension and complexity."
5373,1,"Poor old Speyburn. An unfairly overlooked malt simply because of its (too low) price. The use of more active casks here gives an almost waxed crayon nose along with some sweet depth. In time there are fresh green fruits raspberry mousse and beautiful floral intensity. Water produces lemon. The palate is clean and quite light but there’s a pool of fruits in the center giving a focal point. As water makes things (lemon) soapy I’d have it neat. £40"
5374,9,"A combination of 6 10 and 14 year old Longrow. I was concerned that there would be too much young whisky in here (like there was with the Springbank C.V. several years ago) but this isn’t the case. Youthful? Yes. Immature? No. A Longrow with an attitude. Creamy sweeter vanilla notes up front with kiln smoke sea-soaked stone tar anise chocolate fudge and apricot. I would like to see more of the older whisky in here because it leans towards the young side but it is still a vibrant enjoyable whisky."
5375,1,"Our second Bunna’ this is pale of hue with a surprising hint of salinity alongside a whiff of lemon sherbet and an aroma like wet linen while a floury maltiness runs below. Age however has twisted the fruits into the verge of musty over-ripeness. It’s explosive and spicy and even though this is only 46% it is hot. Water picks up the acidity before there’s a huge hit of warming ginger as the kiss-off. £89"
5376,6,"The first release from Wolfburn distillery is 3 years old. Matured in a mix of Spanish and American oak quarter casks previously used by an Islay distillery. The nose is soft and belies its youth offering vanilla lemon ginger and light smoke. The early palate is grassy. Sweeter fruit notes soon develop with more vanilla and ginger plus white pepper. The finish is quite long and slightly smoky. Much to look forward to as this ages!"
5377,9,"Its deep amber/ruby color suggests a lot of sherry and one whiff confirms. The whisky is rich and sappy in texture with lush notes of ripe sherry fruit balanced by dry mature spicy oak. There’s a pleasant soothing texture to the whisky too but I do struggle to find the subtle complexities which make some bottlings of Glenlivet so special. There’s just so much oak and sherry dominating. At its best after dinner or with a cigar."
5378,6,"Distilled in 2008 from barley peated to 167 ppm and matured in virgin French oak casks. Sweet smoke and oak on the initial nose with quite assertive spices. Freshly sawn timber dried fruits and emerging vanilla. Slightly earthy on the palate where big spice notes continue with peaches orange and milk chocolate. The finish is relatively long with cloves licorice ginger and chili. Bold is the word! (12000 bottles)"
5379,6,"One in the trio of age-stated Singleton of Glen Ords this 18 year old has a nose of sultanas hazelnuts sherry vanilla and a note of pine. Silky on the full palate with vanilla milk chocolate sherry and caramel. The lengthy finish is drying with licorice and chili. RM481"
5380,1,"Pale straw. Light but intense with some pollen dusty fruits baked apple. Water brings out an aroma like a fruit orchard in springtime. Performs much better in the mouth and although hot shows good distillery character with some cooked peach quince jam and yellow plums. A decent lunchtime dram. £50"
5381,1,"A stunningly lovely nose: all sweet rounded and layered with exotic tropical fruits scented woods wax and perfume. Water makes it oilier and more waxy in nature. Sadly though the oak has taken charge on the palate making it more grippy and nutty. Worth a long sniff though! £228"
5382,4,"Ardmore is a rising star in the world of single malt. Until four years ago it was little known in its own right its main purpose being as a key malt in Teacher’s. Then Ardmore Traditional was released and it’s been winning over drinkers ever since. That malt is a delicatessen whisky: smoky oily and savory a unique Highland malt with much to recommend it. This is a different proposition altogether. It’s clean and sweet with pineapple candy dusty and almost incense-like spices and a liberal dose of sweet peat. Some citrus notes too. The peat holds out until the end with impressive effect. There’s talk of this becoming a permanent part of the Ardmore portfolio. Let’s hope so: it’s further proof that Ardmore is a very interesting distillery indeed. (Travel Retail and selected specialist whisky shops.)"
5383,6,"John Black is the veteran master distiller at Tullibardine distillery and this is the sixth release to bear his name. The single malt in question was matured in bourbon barrel #10002. Lemonade dough and maple on the nose. Progressively more floral parma violets pear drops a hint of cinnamon and milk chocolate in time. Hazelnuts and allspice on the palate while citrus fruits emerge plus more milk chocolate and a suggestion of cloves. Medium length with nuts and oak.  £115"
5384,6,"This 10 year old peated expression from Tobermory distillery on Mull was matured in a single refill hogshead and bottled in January 2016. Medicine chests sweet smoke ginger and apple on the nose with damp earth. The palate provides a big hit of peaty spice seaweed black pepper ginger and dark berries. Becoming slightly bitter in the drying ashy medium-length finish. (349 bottles) £48"
5385,9,"Clean simple and straightforward: malty and smooth with cut grass hay a kiss of honey and a hint of gin botanicals. A nice whisky to introduce blend drinkers to the world of single malts."
5386,9,"The 8th in a series of “Links” releases. This one’s further enhanced in Chateau Latour Bordeaux casks. Bright fruity notes of red raspberry rhubarb and candy apple. Teasing fresh brine emerges occasionally along with citrus mango and vanilla. A very perky whisky."
5387,9,"This soft bright easy-going whisky is back in the U.S. after being absent for several years. Very fragrant with vibrant fruit (nectarine plum guava pineapple clementine) honeyed vanilla and subtle macadamia. Fairly light (a pre-dinner or leisurely afternoon malt perhaps?) but evenly balanced. A gentle introduction to single malts for the blended scotch drinker."
5388,9,"Aged for six years in bourbon casks then aged an additional ten years in Bordeaux wine casks. Classic Bowmore peat smoke and red berried fruit (raspberry strawberry) are the main components of this whisky with additional notes of plum grape skin tannins currant caramel and marzipan. Good grip from the Limousin oak (wine casks). Some brine and damp cellar notes emerged occasionally with the smoke lingering long on the finish."
5391,1,"Typically pale and slightly broader than in previous years with a little more fleshiness that rubs alongside squid ink and white pepper. Huge smoke mingles with the sharp tang of brine and a touch of bran. Water brings out lanolin. There’s little oak getting in the way of the distillery character here and while water settles the waves it just doesn’t have the extra dimension that elevates the decent to the great. It does make a great highball tho’. (31428 bottles)"
5392,1,"Light gold with a very fresh and slightly ozonic nose that brings to mind Thai herbs: lemongrass galangal as well as lime. Just slightly nippy when neat. The palate is equally intense but with a central sweetness. Water cuts down this razor-sharp intensity adding a softer mid-palate texture while the finish remains slightly mineraly. A decent aperitif Bunna. £97"
5393,1,"Polished rosewood. Big sherried notes but also generous sweetness. Vermouth-like: dark fruits a hint of spice light oxidation with some herbal edges and Morello cherries. Becomes balsamic. The palate is highly concentrated with more cherry but has this intense savory astringency. Water is needed. The nose continues to be remarkable all damask rose and resin but dilution can’t eradicate the mouth-puckering quality. £130"
5394,1,"Yes it’s another 1991 Bunna from Wemyss so check the name when purchasing. This one has a distinctly smoky element alongside the marine note which they both share. Very light lemon with water then a hit that’s like walking into a high-class sushi joint. A zesty start with lots of angelica and then sweetness with when diluted soft malt and light ginger on the palate. Rock solid. £103"
5395,6,"The Bourbon Matured variant of Balblair’s two Travel Retail expressions of its 2004 vintage is available on a worldwide basis. Light and delicate on the initial nose with ripe pear melon lemon watery toffee and hints of honey and ginger. Sweet orchard fruits on the palate with developing cinnamon coconut and crème brûlée. Tingling spices in the finish with slightly drying oak."
5396,6,"John Dewar & Sons Ltd has released a 12 year old bottling from its Macduff distillery formerly marketed as Glen Deveron but now simply known as the Deveron. Soft sweet and fruity on the nose with vanilla ginger ripe peaches and apple blossom. Medium-bodied gently spicy with butterscotch and Brazil nuts before a hint of licorice kicks in. Quite dry spicy oak in the finish with a contrasting note of caramel. £40"
5397,6,"This 2012 limited edition from the Deeside distillery of Royal Lochnagar underwent initial maturation in bourbon barrels before a period of finishing in muscat wine casks. The pleasing nose offers pears poached in dessert wine heather malt and ginger. Rich and rounded on the palate with immediate soft ripe peaches then figs ginger and cloves. Lengthy in the slightly nutty finish with fruity spice notes."
5398,7,"Matured solely in refill sherry casks this whisky has a light fruit-forward nose with nectarine honey malt and a touch of spice. The entry is softer than you’d expect for the proof and it presents the fruit at the nose along with salt and a dash of black pepper. The spice takes over in the mid-palate along with some heat really throwing off the balance established in the entry. A light finish closes out a slightly disjointed taste experience. (U.S. only)"
5399,6,"This single cask from Macduff distillery was distilled in 1997 and is offered non-chill filtered and with natural color. Melons lemon a hint of ozone and a suggestion of warm steel on the nose. The palate is supple and fruity with ginger white pepper and developing vanilla notes. The finish is medium in length nutty with citrus fruits. (Exclusive to Robertson’s Pitlochry Perthshire) £50"
5400,6,"This is Tomatin’s first cask strength offering and is also non-chill filtered. The initial batch of 15000 bottles was released in February and was matured in a mix of oloroso and bourbon casks. The nose showcases ginger malt Jaffa oranges almonds and melon while the pleasingly viscous palate offers caramel vanilla warm leather and chocolate-coated lime creams. Long and gently spicy in the drying finish. (Worldwide except U.S.) £50"
5401,9,"Good straightforward moderately sherried Balvenie. Classic honeyed notes combine with vanilla ripe barley glazed citrus apricot marmalade cinnamon and nutmeg. A nice entry level Balvenie a solid effort."
5402,9,"A marriage of whiskies from bourbon sherry and port casks which does help give it some complexity. A bit fleshy on the nose (sooty peat soy sauce sherry tannins). It calms down on the palate (and is soothed by the sherry notes) with some additional vanilla bitter orange and brine. More brine and warming pepper on the finish. There’s a lot going on here which I like but I’m not sure all the flavors dovetail with each other well enough to deserve a higher rating."
5403,6,"Oloroso Finish has spent 16 months gaining additional maturation in oloroso casks. The use of sherry wood has lent the nose a greater sweetness with vanilla dates apples and cinnamon. Floral spicy notes with toffee ginger and sweet sherry on the palate giving extra body and resonance. The fruity finish is of medium length with mixed spices and white pepper. £45"
5404,6,"Matured in refill remade American hogsheads this 1998 bottling from Tobermory on the Isle of Mull is of the peated Ledaig variant. The nose offers dry peat brown wrapping paper fish oil and wood preservative. Oily on the palate with bitter orange sweet peat ginger and black pepper plus fabric band-aids. Lingering pepper and Germolene in the ashy finish. £45"
5405,6,"Bottled at 8 years of age as part of Exclusive Malts’ U.S. Batch 5 this is a relatively youthful expression of the peated Ledaig spirit produced at Tobermory distillery. The nose is full-on and vibrant with seaweed brine peat black pepper and new leather. The palate opens with a big punch of spicy peat then sweet cereal notes and more black pepper. Hot smoke and spice in the medium-length finish with a hint of coal."
5406,6,"American Oak is new to the Auchentoshan core range in 2014 and is the first release from this Lowland distillery to be matured solely in first-fill bourbon casks. An initial note of rosewater then Madeira vanilla developing musky peaches and icing sugar. Spicy fresh fruit on the palate chili notes and more Madeira and vanilla. The finish is medium in length and spicy to the end."
5407,9,"Pleasant aroma (subtle but with nice depth) with notes of honeyed lime kiwi chopped nuts chocolate fudge and gentle seasoned tobacco. Everything is working nicely on the palate too with a similar flavor profile (the nuts now being roasted) and some smoldering smoke until about mid-palate when its age becomes evident with some wet wood notes blending in the mix through to the finish. (Exclusive to Virginia ABC.)"
5408,9,"A very textural whisky. Incredibly creamy with mouth-coating vanilla honeyed barley hay linseed oil clementine and subtle peach. The whisky continues to cling to the palate long after the finish. It’s what you would expect Auchentoshan to taste like but bolder. A nice whisky but lacking the polish of the standard 21 year old expression."
5409,4,"This whisky is doddery and on the edge bordering on feeble. You have to look hard to find its spark and fire but if you search for it it is there. The nose is light and savory with crushed fall leaves and chestnut on the nose. On the palate there are traces of licorice stick a touch of cumin anise and a creamier less bitter chocolate note than some other samples. It finishes with traces of mandarin but overall the sun is setting and the spirited and energetic man of old seems to be getting bitter. Overall though still pretty impressive for its age. £380"
5410,4,"This is the most seasonal of this batch of GlenDronachs with a nose of rich stewed prunes and fermenting fruit in an orchard at harvest time. There is some anise and cherry lozenge in the mix too and the palate is complex with plums stewed fruits and damson jam. The finish is drying dusty and spiky. £80"
5411,9,"Turns quite murky with water but don’t let this scare you off. Fragrant and flowery on the nose. A sweet whisky with a honeyed malt and creamy vanilla foundation a mélange of tropical fruit (mandarin lime pineapple) and soft oak on the finish. Pleasant enough but I wish the flavors were crisper cleaner and more well-defined. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
5412,9,"The tell-tale rich honeyed Balvenie personality is spiced up by finishing it off in new charred oak casks making a normally masculine whisky even bigger. The honeyed malt impacts the palate first with intermediate notes of citrus fruit followed by dried spices (cinnamon vanilla ginger and cocoa). The new oak impact is most evident on the whisky’s long dry spicy finish. A nice whisky but perhaps a tad too much new oak for greatness?"
5413,9,"Very fruity and spicy. High bright fruit notes of lemon mandarin and mango with a sprinkling of ginger and powdered vanilla. Oak kicks in on the end leading to a fairly dry finish which is not surprising for a 30 year old whisky."
5414,1,"With the hue of pigeon blood (a ruby not a dead bird) initially this seems closed but richness develops mixing stewed Assam tea chocolate biscuit raisin damson jam and a whiff of tomato puree. The oak gives it the character of a Barolo Chinato. A knife and fork are needed to consume it but for all the big tannins there’s dark rose petal and the bittersweet edge of licorice. Dry rich and hermetic. For the hardcore sherry lover. 145 bottles."
5415,9,"Tastes more mature than its age would suggest. It’s packed with ripe sweet barley (especially at the palate entry). There are some high citrus fruit notes and anise that emerge before the signature Laphroaig peat smoke and tar wallops you. Very vibrant and youthful but without being too green. A steal for $45. (A Binny’s Beverage Depot exclusive)"
5416,9,"Lovely golden honey color. Lush and sweet (the Sauternes impact is obvious) with honey-drenched apricot sultana and lemon gum drops. Vanilla candied nuts and subtle botanicals round out the palate. Decent oak grip on the finish keeps the whisky from being too cloying."
5417,1,"This year’s bottling mixes 4 and 5 year old bourbon casks with the younger element finished in oloroso though this is hardly sherried. Here is smoke samphire and Kilchoman’s fleshy core giving echoes of 80s cuisine: scallops and white peaches anyone? Watering shows sea-washed rock light flowers and hot sand. The palate is sweet sour and smoky with a chalky edge and a peppery palate but water releases blossom and a little gunsmoke: a duel in the dunes? £39"
5418,9,"Spicy and botanical on the nose with notes of ginger juniper lemon grass orange and grapefruit rind. Similar follow-through on the palate with added notes of vanilla honeyed malt and hay. Gentle dried herb and spice finish. Certainly some interesting -- perhaps even peculiar -- flavors from this product of the demolished Lowland distillery."
5419,9,"Full gold. Oily in texture with ripe barley front-loaded toffee honey-drenched citrus fallen orchard fruit and a full complement of spice (cinnamon nutmeg and clove). Gripping resinous slightly hot finish. The flavors don’t meld together here as well as the other three expressions but it’s still a fun ride. (Price is per 1 liter)."
5420,9,"Antique gold color. Fruity aroma with delicate notes of spice (anise eucalyptus). More fruit on the palate-soft in texture and gently sweet-with interwoven fresh spice notes and a pleasing rounded finish. A gentle medium-bodied dram."
5421,6,"Named after the Viking chieftain whose exploits are central to the Orkneyinga Saga Svein is the least typically Highland Park of the initial three Warrior releases. The nose is oily with starch and ozone then ultimately freshly-squeezed orange and lemon juice. The palate offers a suggestion of smoke sawdust and vanilla. Nutty and slightly peppery in the finish with just a suggestion of peat. €40/liter"
5422,7,"From an undisclosed Speyside distillery. The nose is extraordinarily yeasty with distinct apple cider backed by light caramel. The palate is more integrated than the nose with oak and cinnamon spice apple honey and malt. At first these flavors are well balanced but a spice and heat blast in the mid-palate throws things off. The finish reflects this and is quite dry. The parts are better than the whole in an interesting and strong whisky.  (U.S. only)"
5423,1,"Bottling of a large package of 12 butts and 30 hoggies dating from 1972. The nose is slightly closed initially but shows good mature distillery character: old apple potpourri more raspberry and furniture polish. The palate is a little dry with humidor and light chocolate but needs water to bring out the fruit-sugar sweetness. It’s good but that low bottling strength has sapped it of the energy which is vital for old whiskies. (U.S. only)"
5424,9,"Finished in a dark rum cask. Notes of peat smoked mackerel and suggestions of charcoal married with molasses vanilla wafer golden raisin cantaloupe and a dollop of honey. It’s missing the more defined fruit notes that the other two have. I’d like to see this at 15 years to give it more depth."
5425,1,"The Darkness! series involves finishing in specially-made octave (50-liter) casks. This has positive Macallan character with some oil (putty even) and touches of malt and turned earth but also a scented cognac-like fruitiness with added spice. Water adds a little sherried cheesiness. The palate shows some nutty oxidized flavors to begin with but then in the middle the PX flumps onto the tongue slowing and dampening the drive. Pleasant enough though. £110/500 ml"
5426,9,"In the same genre as BenRiach 12 year old but more concentrated with additional notes of resinous oak light toffee and soft caramelized pear."
5427,1,"Glendullan has reimagined itself with a trio of Travel Retail exclusives. This the most expensive has been given some secondary maturation in Muscat wine casks. It’s the most complex of the trio with more citric elements hints of hay and some spice while the richness and dried scented fruit of the Muscat is a good accompaniment to the sloe-like side of the distillery character. A thick vanilla component helps the palate along to a chocolatey finish."
5428,9,"Tobermory’s peated offering. Great to see Ledaig hitting its stride with a brisk punch of peat and not chill-filtered. There’s a bit of a raw edge too quite bracing but still plenty of soothing sweetness. Earthy peat smoke ripe barley honeyed vanilla bourbon barrel char black licorice stick espresso bean olive brine and suggestions of beef jerky. In some respects it even tastes younger than 10 years old but I’m balancing that with bonus points for distinctiveness."
5429,6,"Tullibardine 228 Burgundy is finished in red Burgundy casks from Chateau de Chassagne Montrachet the home of Maison Michel Picard which owns Tullibardine distillery. The nose features charred oak vanilla milk chocolate-covered Turkish Delight and mild sweet chili. Sweet and spicy on the nutty palate with eating apples cranberries and a silky texture. Allspice and damsons in the lengthy finish."
5430,6,"Matured in first-fill bourbon casks for an unspecified period Sovereign offers a nose that is floral with new-mown hay vanilla and soft fudge. Fruity on the palate with milk chocolate malt and subtle cinnamon. Cocoa vanilla and more spice in the finish. Relatively uncomplicated but very drinkable."
5431,9,"The only distillery-approved bottling of Bladnoch in the United States. When compared to the Gordon & MacPhail bottling above this one isn’t as sweet or creamy in texture. There’s more citrus fruit and a drier spicier finish. This one is also bolder and a bit more aggressive."
5432,9,"A nicely clean Longmorn expressing floral notes (especially violets) and bright fruit (lemon lime cantelope plums) supported interwoven notes of honey rich malt bread pudding dates and vanilla. The classic Longmorn viscosity is there and this thickness is tamed by a very pleasing spicy dry oak finish with a hint of salt. I could drink this stuff anytime. G&M’s move to 46% has certainly benefited this whisky. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot.)"
5433,6,"Matured in a refill hogshead the out-turn was 262 bottles. The nose is malty with the oiliness of figs plus dates and tinned peaches. Supple on the palate with vanilla honey and spicy resin notes. The finish is medium in length warming and slightly herbal with nutmeg and malt. £90"
5434,9,"Rich good body blueberry muffin black cherry a lot of tannic grip (perhaps a little too much for balance). Not as polished as the Pomerol or Madeira."
5435,1,"The Micro Provenance series is Bruichladdich’s web-exclusive range of single cask bottlings. This is made from barley grown on Rockside Farm (now owned by Kilchoman) and has been aged in virgin oak. The oak doesn’t dominate the nose allowing fresh cereal sweetness to develop along with an estery lift and some jasmine/meadowsweet florals. The palate is where creamy vanilla and white chocolate show through. Fresh balanced and bottled at the right time. (468 bottles) £90"
5436,1,"Very chewy. Think of melting Mars bars with a touch of coconut cream then red-fruit acidity red cherry and lemon. All very forward and sweet but with no alcohol when neat showing an active cask. Dilute there’s coconut pea shoots and banoffie pie. The palate is thick with Jaffa cake (orange and chocolate) then nutty granola. It doesn’t take water too well. Quite fat. £50/500 ml"
5437,1,"A distillate of Islay-grown barley made in 2009-10 and aged in bourbon wood. Here’s an intense Kilchoman with a licorice root sweetness mixed with dried seaweed machair (beach pasture) cereal and herbal smoke. The palate is slightly oily and hot when neat with a distinct mineral edge. Water shows its youth but also allows tarragon and wormwood to develop. £64"
5438,1,"Oak-driven with cream and butterscotch dominating the nose initially. Then there’s black cherry and coriander seed frying in butter. The weighty distillate adds depth but not specific flavors. The palate is all coconut cream cream toffee then Longmorn’s cooked plum density comes in. I’d have preferred the oak to be scaled back allowing the distillate to show but if you’re looking for a scotch made for bourbon lovers then go no further."
5439,9,"Aged in a refill butt and very pale in color. Very fragrant -- fruity and spicy -- with notes of vanilla lemongrass ginger sultana citrus zest key lime and green grapes. There’s a floral component too (rose petals?). A very delicate Macallan and quite suitable as an aperitif. (749 bottles produced.)"
5440,6,"This 18 year old was matured in refill hogsheads before a period of finishing in first-fill bourbon casks. It is non-chill filtered. The nose is light and fruity with pears melon and mild vanilla plus caramel and a hint of toffee. Rich and full on the textured palate with big orchard fruits honey buttery spice notes then emerging aniseed. Dries in the finish with plain chocolate and slightly tannic oak notes plus a sprinkling of chili heat."
5441,9,"A nicely honeyed malty foundation is balanced by fruit on the front of the palate with a pleasingly dry spicy finish. It would benefit by being bottled at 43% like the older two expressions. It is simple straight-forward and unpretentious as one would expect in a 10 year old whisky."
5442,6,"Principally matured in bourbon casks this expression has undergone a finishing period in sherry casks. Sweet wood polish on the nose with brief pineapple juice notes and rosehip syrup. Smooth and fruity on the palate with vanilla spicy milk chocolate sultanas and some earthiness. The finish is medium in length with sherry and a tang of bitter orange. £47"
5443,1,"Cragganmore is a whisky that typically needs time before it starts to get going and which then goes through many changes on its journey to its complex layered apogee. Here it is at a slightly contradictory midpoint. The nose is fragrant and fruity: apricots stewed apple and yes lemon; and with water a hint of smoke. The palate meanwhile shows more of the earthy depth and sloe berry richness that will slowly emerge. A pleasing dram nonetheless. £75"
5444,9,"This 21 year old expression is lighter in color and not as sweet or fruity as the younger 17 year old also reviewed here. Very mouthcoating in texture with notes of dry vanilla fat barley coconut citrus fruit and pineapple. Long intensely appetizing dry salty finish. As an aperitif or perhaps with seafood."
5445,7,"Remarkably pale in color this Exclusive Malt is a rare peated Dalmore. Peat reads more funky barnyard than smoke on the nose with just a touch of sweetness behind it. The taste is much better than the smell with the addition of smoke to the peat intertwined with honey salt citrus and ginger spice. The finish is slightly acidic and dry far less satisfying than the mid-palate. There’s a reason why Dalmore doesn’t peat but this release is still fascinating. (U.S. only)"
5446,6,"Matured in a mixture of bourbon refill and recharred casks. Ripe peaches malt and vanilla on the nose with a hint of linseed oil. Oily on the palate with more peaches plus quite dark spices backed by creamy vanilla. Medium in length spicy with emerging dry oak notes. £36"
5447,1,"Light gold. A little shy initially but Glenallachie isn’t noted for its effusiveness. It has a clean and slightly nutty aroma with light honey alongside grilled hazelnut. The palate is fairly crisp and slightly bunched up to start until this nutty sweetness expands in the center. Ever so slightly oily. Water flattens the aromatics a bit but allows the flavors to spread gently. All in all a decent example of an uncommonly seen single malt. £85"
5448,9,"Aged half in used bourbon barrels half in refill sherry casks. Thicker more viscous and with much more depth than the other three Bruichladdichs reviewed here. The whisky oozes syrupy vanilla marshmallow caramel and marzipan accentuated by coconut and other tropical fruits. Bruichladdich's signature freshness and brine emerges but oh so subtly. It finishes firmly dry and oaky thanks to all those years in wood. Initially this helps to cut some of the sweetish viscosity of this whisky but it lingers a bit too long for my palate. I would like to have tried this whisky a few (or perhaps even several) years back."
5449,1,"Another catch-up from G&M this time from the ‘Beast of Dufftown.’ Immediate substance and solidity which is what you want from Mortlach but there’s also thick-cut marmalade and cumin. Only with water however does the classic meatiness emerge—like a lamb tangine with apricot. A cleaner slightly lighter side to the Flora & Fauna 16 year old but with heft and a burnt licorice sweetness. A great introduction to a classic distillery."
5450,6,"Maturation for this 21 year old bottling of Bladnoch occurred in a refill American oak hogshead. Sweet orchard fruits new-mown hay malt and soft toffee on the nose. The palate is initially fruity with more malt then nuttiness develops with aniseed and black pepper. The finish is relatively short and tannic. (U.S. only)"
5451,9,"The distillery closed in 1993. Very fragrant with a potpourri of dried spice herbs and (to a lesser degree) flowers on the nose and palate. The spices are accentuated by mint tea fennel clove and faint vegetal notes. Dry spicy finish. Not an elegant Rosebank but rather this is Rosebank with an attitude."
5452,1,"Gold. Quite sweet and spicy nose. Light cinnamon and that distillery ginger edge. There remains a light cereal aspect to the background but it is considerably more youthful than the age suggests. The palate is equally sweet and direct with excellent spicy concentration. Water shows that there is some weight here reminiscent of honey-nut cornflakes (with cream). The nose now hints at some oxidation the palate retains peppery freshness. It’s another I’d have kept in cask. £135"
5453,9,"A relative newcomer to the Scotch whisky industry having just turned 12. And over the past decade we’ve had plenty of opportunity to watch this whisky mature as it was first bottled after a few years as Drumguish and then under the Speyside name as an 8 year old and 10 year old before this 12 year old expression. This whisky continues to develop with age. The foundation of this particular bottling is a generous serving of toffee nuts and vanilla fudge. Fruity golden raisin and peach notes provide contrast with toffee and subtle oak on the finish. Whisky for dessert anyone?"
5454,6,"Initial maturation of Valour takes place in first-fill bourbon casks before a period in 30 year old Matusalem oloroso sherry butts from Gonzales Byass. Finally it is transferred to port pipes from the Duoro region of Portugal. The nose is floral with sherry notes ripe oranges and marzipan while the palate offers dark sherry with bitter orange contrasting chocolate-coated fudge and gingersnaps. The finish is medium to long with lively spices and berry bitterness. (Travel Retail only) Price is per liter."
5455,1,"Very Singleton of Dufftown: while that means easy drinking and approachable it also
can suggest a single malt without a spark of wayward genius. This is
typically very ordered: nuts and honey with malt and pecan pie underneath. As
it opens there’s dried lemon oak dried fig and (dilute) pencil shavings. The
palate is—typically—sweet and thick though here with a refreshing sharpness
like a mix of wine gums and cider. I’d add a rock or two of ice. (Travel Retail exclusive) £38/1 liter"
5456,6,"An 11 year old Fettercairn from Douglas Laing this is an undemanding but pleasing Highland dram. It comes from a distillery which tends to polarize opinion among drinkers. The nose is light and crisp slightly floral with pear juice and a hint of honey. Sweet and spicy on the palate with hazelnuts and drinking chocolate. Powdery in the finish with tangerines and a suggestion of Parma violets. £37"
5457,6,"Initially mulch and damp undergrowth on the nose with a whiff of sulfur. Then developing soft toffee and vanilla notes though the ‘outdoors’ odor remains. Big and oily in the mouth with a chewy texture. Oak citrus fruit hazelnuts and spices plus a hint of gunpowder tea. Medium to long in the finish with more oak ginger and quite bitter coffee. A typically ‘off the rails’ independent Ben Nevis. Great if you have a soft spot for a ‘bad boy!’"
5458,9,"Notes of smoked olives and an earthy peatiness wrapped inside layers of sweetness (honey caramel and light toffee). The whisky is laced with seaweed and pepper for added zest with a long smoky and peppery finish. It shows enough maturity yet it is young enough to let the true Caol Ila character shine through. I would like to have seen this whisky bottled at a higher strength and not chill-filtered."
5459,6,"This 1995 vintage is exclusively available from Whisky Shop in the UK. The whisky was selected by distillery manager Ian Mackay and his team and matured in Matusalem sherry and American white oak casks. 1800 bottles are available. Worn leather candied orange malt and cinnamon on the nose. Spicy orange sherry mixed nuts and licorice on the palate. The finish is slowly drying with dark chocolate and smoky caramel notes. £85"
5460,9,"Style: Highland (Isle of Skye) single malt scotch Color: Antique amber Aroma: Toffee cookies fresh from the oven waxy ripe fruit bonfire smoke and damp peat with background notes of pepper brine smoked kippers and a hint of seaweed. Palate: Similar to its aroma. Full-bodied and quite thick in texture. Dry smoky peppery finish."
5461,9,"Soft and creamy in texture. A delicate mélange of fruit and a teasing nuttiness balance nicely with the whisky’s gently sweet notes of lightly toasted marshmallow and caramel finishing soft and pleasingly dry. A very smooth whisky you could drink all day long."
5462,9,"Fresh and clean with notes of creamy barley cut grass coconut marshmallow pencil shavings and oatcake. Soft finish. Subtle spice dances about in the background. Bottling at 46% adds to the richness. A soothing whisky."
5463,9,"Youthful and fiery oozing with testosterone. Toffee apple intoxicated with kiln-trapped peat smoke charcoal ash anise honeyed malt brine peppered seaweed kippers and damp earth. Brisk and warming. Okay this is a young “in your face” Islay single malt. Young Islay whiskies show the true character of Islay (which I like) and this is a young one. Ideally I’d like to see another five years not chill-filtered and bottled at 46% ABV but there’s still a sort of “raw edge” attraction here."
5464,9,"Here’s a whisky not seen very often in the U.S. When it is seen it’s from one of the independent bottlers. I have always felt that younger Glen Grant whiskies make a nice introduction to the single malt category-especially for a blend drinker trading up. The whisky is usually light to medium in body and uncomplicated-with no harsh edges to be particularly offensive. And so it is with this whisky. A soft cereal grain maltiness marries nicely with floral delicately fruity notes throughout. Gentle dry but malty finish with suggestions of shortbread cookies and vanilla. A nice representation of a younger Glen Grant. The flavors are clean and tight."
5465,9,"Invigorating and youthful with a raw edge to it. Challenging notes of creosote charred oak and earthy peat fire dominate with underlying ripe barley honey and caramel apple. Aggressive but not over the top."
5466,10,"Overripe cantaloupe green apple banana custard and whole almond are the main soloists though they are accompanied by a linear grain overture running through it. A quartet of golden sultana mint ginger and pepper play the opening movement then sit back as toffee-dipped banana flavors orchestrate a delicious climax before a diminuendo into minor chords with sour gooseberry and herbal notes to finish. Water works well elevating bright notes of lemon sponge on the palate. (238 bottles)"
5467,1,"Bright gold. Very citric sweet candied orange and tangerine marmalade with a hint of pink grapefruit. As I said citric. There’s meadow hay and some sherbet as well. Water brings out lucerne grass. The palate is equally delicate and ‘up’ and quite acidic (no bad thing) with light nutty chocolate and macadamia nut. When diluted there’s poached pear and charred oak. The finish is effervescent. Light easy-going keenly priced. The rehabilitation of Cardhu continues. £41"
5468,1,"You could argue that there’s an element of auto-suggestion at work when you pick up saltiness in Inchgower after all it comes from a fishing port (Buckie). But taste it blind and there it is — an unmistakable salinity on nose and palate which when combined with lemon accents cumin seed thin fruit syrups and green grapes makes this an intense perfect aperitif. £37 (Not available in the U.S.)"
5469,1,"With Longmorn you are always looking for a dense sweet fruitiness. This doesn’t disappoint on the nose where there’s moist compacted fruitcake with marzipan Brazil nut glacé cherry a hint of tobacco then hard toffee. The palate is soft to start but then an overly firm grip and slightly bitter edges come through. Though water improves it the oak is slightly too dominant. That said the nose is superb. £80"
5470,9,"This cask-strength whisky turns cloudy with the addition of water. Nice balance of both moderate sherry and smoke with underlying fruit gum drops shortbread charcoal black licorice and subtle herbs. An assertive whiskey. The flavors aren’t as crisp as I would like but pretty good for seven years old. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot)"
5471,9,"A “straight from the cask” bottling finished in a Grand Arôme rum barrel. I can really pick up the rum. If you’ve ever had rum from La Reunion island (easiest to find in France) you immediately pick it out here. Peculiar straw gold/lime green color. Intriguing on the palate too: botanicals fennel liqueur-ish honeyed malt red licorice and tropical fruit. Sort of like a cross between a scotch and something Benedictine monks would make. A nice change of pace. (Bottled for Maxwell Street Trading Co.)"
5472,1,"A much-beloved malt in the U.S. Some say it’s because it is easy to pronounce (though having said that remember it’s ‘OH-bin’ and not ‘O’Bahn’). I’d prefer to think its popularity is because there is something about the fresh cleanliness of the nose its orange oils chocolate and zesty-zingy and yes occasionally salty spiciness that is instantly appealing."
5473,1,"Massive with a huge sherried attack; seven years is the right time to bottle. There’s light raisin date and fig roll/treacle toffee but it’s a funny one as it develops; while it is superficially impressive it becomes clear that the oak-driven and distillery-derived parts aren’t talking to each other. Water brings out light cask-driven sulfur. On the palate the black fruits and Demerara rum take initial charge along with menthol. It’s tannic already though. Lacks integration but what else to do?"
5474,6,"Hazelburn CV is the non-age-statement version of Springbank’s unpeated triple distilled single malt introduced in 2010 to accompany the existing 8 and 12 year old variants. Initially slightly mashy and herbal on the nose with acetone and cigarette packets. Citric and more malty with time. Orange ginger vanilla and sherbet zest on the spicy palate. The finish is medium in length and spicy with a slight suggestion of salt. A fresh breezy aperitif dram. £33 (Not available in the U.S.)"
5475,1,"Once again some assertive distillery character to the fore which in BenRiach’s case means plenty of ripe sweet fruits cooked apples a jag of citrus and a background malty note. There’s a pleasant slightly oxidative wine-like note with water. The sweetness dominates the palate with the nuttiness moving to hot breakfast cereal and in typical BenRiach fashion a sweet spiced finish. Lovely but not overly different from official bottlings."
5476,9,"Firm on the palate and quite mature. Good balance with malty-toffee notes accented by dried oak spices. Additional notes of roasted nuts tobacco Earl Grey tea sandalwood and a hint of peat and bacon fat. (260 bottles produced.)"
5477,9,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Bright gold Aroma: Fresh cut grass. Damp grist. Vanilla marshmallow and banana. Palate: Sweet malt initially then quickly becoming dry oaky grassy and spicy. Big long dry spicy finish."
5478,1,"Full gold. A solid middle-weight Macallan with some putty/Play-Doh and even after this length of time a certain youthful airiness. This slightly lean aspect gives way to an almost suety richness. When neat the palate is a little jumbled: caramelized cask-derived notes cereal oiled jackets. Water improves things releasing an aroma akin to Chenin Blanc then cooked pear and a big hit of sugared almonds on the back palate. £69"
5479,1,"This new NAS might surprise those who recall the Chivas Bros. “Age Matters” campaign but that’s whisky for you. The initial impression is of a fresh maltiness sweet hay and fresh porridge oats then comes sawn oak but it opens into pineapple becoming more obviously Glenlivet. The palate is pretty and light but seems a bit hollow in the middle making the whole package slightly insubstantial. Water enhances and sweetens the nose but deepens that mid-palate hole. £30"
5480,6,"This bottling celebrates distillery manager Douglas Campbell’s 50 years of service at Tomatin and includes casks from 1967 1976 1984 and 1990 along with a peated Tomatin from 2005. The nose is initially slightly musty with faint peat smoke sweetening to mild vanilla with new leather and peaches in time. Full-bodied relatively dry on the palate with the European oak casks in the ascendancy here. Raisins dark chocolate and licorice. Medium to long in the finish drying with spicy oak."
5481,9,"The newest whisky in the regular stable of wood-finished whiskies for Glenmorangie. Very fruity-sometimes reminiscent of overripe fruit; other times cooked fruit. In the mix there’s maple syrup plum almonds and sweet barley notes. The whisky is peppered with spicy notes of toasted oak cinnamon and vanilla. A whisky that is lush on the nose chewy on the palate with a finish of dried spices for balance. This whisky takes some getting used to and it’s not an every day whisky. You’ll have to be in the right mood for it."
5482,4,"Four years ago Glen Grant was in a sorry state its beautiful gardens in need of some love and attention its malts neglected and seemingly unloved. Then Campari bought it and we have heard very little more since. That’s until now. With a new visitor center the gardens in full bloom and the owners determined to make it a major player things are looking up. This limited edition 170th anniversary bottling is made up of vintages stretching back to the 70s. They include a couple of sherry butts and some peated spirit. The result is a rich malt with some buttery toffee notes at first distinctive lemon and green apple notes and a touch of aniseed. Midway through it sets off in a more feisty direction with some peat sharp spice and green banana skin. Beguiling and unusual it’s a statement of intent from an iconic distillery — watch this space. (Selected specialist outlets excluding the U.S.)"
5483,9,"The most heavily peated of the three (35ppm phenol) but rather gentle for such smoke intensity. No doubt this is partly due to its sweet underbelly of vanilla cream puff honeyed barley and melon fruit. The other factor is that the smoke influence is not medicinal like some other Islay whiskies but rather more of a leafy bonfire smoke with burning embers and teasing brine on the finish. Like Waves Peat comes across as a bit youthful."
5484,9,"Very much in the Glenrothes style with a viscous texture that clings to the palate. Very perfumed and fragrant too with flavors of assorted dried fruit vanilla golden raisin citrus and honey that dry quickly on the palate. A suggestion of peat lingers in the background and on the whisky’s clinging finish."
5485,1,"Light and very creamy with very subtle smoke in the background this is like eating a white chocolate ice cream while walking toward a distant beach barbecue. The palate is gentle and sweet with good refreshing saline balance. Water brings out mint. It’s just a little too tight and disconnected on the tongue."
5486,6,"This single cask (#10328) bottling was distilled in the summer of 2006 and matured in a refill hogshead. The nose is initially slightly mashy with savory notes becoming more floral with caramel. Bold and spicy on the palate with roasted meat and underlying citrus fruit and herbal notes. Mildly metallic dark chocolate in the medium-length finish.  £42"
5487,9,"Fresh and floral with lively tropical fruit honey and vanilla. Gentle on the palate with a slight syrupy texture to its malty foundation. Youthful orange marmalade finish with a hint of spice. A pleasant easy-going whisky."
5488,6,"This Glencadam variant has been finished for 20 months in ruby port pipes. The result is a whisky that departs from its younger stablemate by offering a nose of rose petals milk chocolate stewed rhubarb sweet red wine and black pepper. The same ‘new paper’ note survives however. Viscous on the palate; initially strawberries then spicy milk chocolate caramel and candied cherries. Remaining sweet in the finish with nutmeg and darker chocolate notes. £35"
5489,12,"Somewhat vegetal on the nose with stewed fruit licorice tarragon ginger butterscotch and hazelnuts. More stewed fruit salted licorice and hazelnuts appear on the palate along with white pepper clove and bitter oak. An abrupt whisky whose better characteristics are muddied by the first-fill rum cask finish. (Trader Joe’s)"
5490,9,"Honey vanilla heather and citrus are the major components of this Highland Park with a hint of youthful peat in the background. Some polished oak kicks in on the palate towards the finish. A pleasant whisky for those who like a mature Highland Park without the sherry cask influence. (A Bayway World of Liquor exclusive.)"
5491,9,"Aged in a bourbon cask. This is a big vibrantly fruity whisky (lemon lime orange grape) with background notes of anise fat barley and vanilla. An unusual and often difficult to find dram. (Bottled exclusively for “Wine on the 9”.)"
5492,9,"An interesting comparison to the Mackillop’s Choice expression reviewed above. This is also a big bold whisky from the currently mothballed Imperial distillery. This one is less fruity. Instead it is quite sweet with a ripe maltiness up front-and rather viscous in texture-becoming dry slightly austere and spicy on the finish with a wisp of smoke. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot.)"
5493,9,"Lemon-lime gum drops and fresh-cut grass notes with an underlying creamy marshmallow-tinged maltiness. Plenty of vanilla along with a hint of ginger spice zing. Clean nicely rounded and fully mature for its age."
5494,1,"Master of Malt is an online whisky retailer branching out with its own bottlings. This from an unnamed distillery is lightly honeyed with some quince apricot and yellow plum while there’s a mix of vanillin and dry bracken/grass behind. Light clean and balanced the palate is refined and relaxed with Demerara-like sweetness and a finish of honey-coated nuts. I wanted more oomph on the palate which might have come at 43% or 46%. £100"
5495,9,"Whisky from two different sherry casks. The sherry extra aging and higher strength produce an intensely rich Auchentoshan. Fudgy caramel toffee and cocoa notes are offset by golden raisin apricot and Clementine. Underlying notes of roasted nuts old leather and spice (vanilla mint) peek through occasionally. An enjoyable whisky but much of the Auchentoshan is lost somewhere in all that oak and sherry."
5496,9,"Gold color. Aroma of vanilla honeyed malt subtle marshmallow with background herbal hay-like notes. Light and creamy in body. Creamy malty vanilla notes in flavor-honey sweet initially but eventually drying out towards the finish with soft herbal grassy hay notes."
5497,4,"No doubt about it we’re at the furthest outpost of GlenDronach’s territory here and this particular cask has waved the white flag. It has a dense sappy and nutty nose which is very savory and not particularly attractive. But thankfully there’s more to welcome you on the palate with some rich orange and red fruit and sweet candy providing balance to the savory notes and gentle oak and hazelnuts also getting a look in. The finish is woody and pruney. £185"
5514,6,"A relatively heavily-peated variant of Glenglassaugh matured in 50-liter octave casks giving significant cask influence due to the high surface-to-volume ratio. This expression is non-chill filtered. Carbolic soap and a mineral note on the softly smoky nose followed by apple pie and cream notes. The palate is medium-sweet and quite spicy with black pepper. Now clear dry peat notes present themselves with a touch of chili. Ashy peat and cinnamon in the medium-length finish. £55"
5498,9,"This is the new super-peated (131 ppm phenol barley) Bruichladdich. “Super-peated” seems almost like an understatement. Ultra-peated perhaps? Intense smoke on the nose and palate with notes of freshly tarred road cigar smoke and ash licorice root bacon fat kalamata olive and smoked seaweed. Struggling to emerge are youthful orchard fruit honeyed malt brine and soft vanilla. Long smoky finish -- like licking the walls of a peat-infused kiln. A very invigorating whisky. It’s a few years younger than the other ultra-peated whisky Ardbeg Supernova. I think if they were both the same age I would like them equally (and score them equally -- I gave Supernova an 89). But the Octomore does taste a little green which was not noticeable in the Supernova. I think Octomore will be very good in another five years and amazing in another ten. Let’s hope the lads at Bruichladdich are holding some stocks back."
5499,9,"Lochside closed in 1992 and its whisky will become increasingly difficult to find. Very fragrant and quite fruity with lemon raspberry red currant and plum on the nose. It starts out clean and fruity on the palate too with a gentle maltiness but this is quickly taken over by dominant toffee and caramel. A nice Lochside whisky which could have been even better with a little less toffee on the finish."
5500,9,"When compared to Craiglodge reviewed above this whisky is more intensely smoky tarry and youthful on the palate. The other flavors while in the same vein as Craiglodge are more reserved (or perhaps more greatly overshadowed by the peat). If your intent is full-throttle peat this is your whisky. If you want variety on the palate go for the Craiglodge."
5501,1,"I’m a fan of the original Nadurra’s freshness which maximizes Glenlivet’s apple blossom and pineapple perfume. This pleasantly funky new brother has been matured wholly in oloroso which adds (very) sweet sherry nougat blackcurrant grilled pear and malt. While the palate starts well with mixed red and black fruits (and a little grapefruit) the sherry adds thickness from back palate on and the distillery slides away. Pleasant but a tale of two halves. (Travel Retail exclusive) £50"
5502,1,"Another Benrinnes from the UK bottler’s new range here the finish is more forceful with masses of raisined sweetness blueberry syrup and molasses. The Benrinnes character adds weight and a firm earthy base but this is more cask driven slightly grippy and for all the richness of the PX cask the end result is a little bitter because of the treacle/molasses note. Fun certainly but a bit over the top. £60/500 ml"
5503,1,"Light gold. From a refill bourbon cask here we have more marzipan and some light maltiness alongside very fresh fruit and delicate vanilla. This is Rothes in slightly lean and hungry mode with its signature fruits and spices in the background. Needs water to smooth things out. When that happens there’s lemon drizzle cake leafiness and walnut flour. A little short on the finish.  £90"
5504,6,"The first widely-available single malt from the revived distillery of Glenglassaugh Revival comprises spirit from both first and refill casks finished in first-fill oloroso sherry butts for a period of six months. Initially a little mashy with beer-like aromas. Quite sweet and mildly sherried with developing roasted malt notes ginger hazelnuts and caramel. Leather and insistent spice on the palate majoring in nutmeg and cinnamon. Straightforward in the finish; spicy and nutty. Probably a crackerjack in another dozen years!"
5505,1,"Another Travel Retail exclusive but what is a highly lucrative retail sector will inevitably demand items that shoppers can’t buy elsewhere. Imagine Balvenie Port Wood 21 year old but with more sweetness; damson jam blueberries and a slight singed note before maple syrup calls in from the back. It’s big and rounded and for me just lacking the definition and complexity of the Port Wood. For sweeter tooths (teeth?) perhaps."
5506,9,"This peated expression of Springbank is fresh powerful and unbridled. A brief gristy sweet malt intro quickly becomes quite aggressive with an attack of tar damp peat kippers mustard seed Spanish olives and Poire Williams. The sweetness emerges again briefly before succumbing to an assertive fiery finish."
5507,6,"Tullibardine 225 Sauternes is finished in Sauternes dessert wine casks from Chateau Suduiraut in Bordeaux and the nose majors in citrus fruits vanilla pepper and a discreet herbal note. Citrus fruits carry through to the spicy palate with Jaffa orange to the fore plus malt. Spicy to the very end with milk chocolate and a suggestion of passion fruit."
5508,1,"Using this ancient barley variety is a challenge for a distiller. The yields are low the mash thick and hard to work but I’m delighted that Bruichladdich has persevered. It adds a more overt cereal note to the whisky taking the Laddie off into a different world of honey-nut corn flakes. There’s also a surprising rose-like perfume. It’s young so add water to cut its more er bracing qualities. In fact have it with ice and soda. (Travel Retail exclusive) £58"
5509,9,"Beautiful complex fruit on the nose. Tannic grip on the palate -- especially on the finish. The tell-tale orange marmalade combines notes of orchard fruit caramel apple fried pineapple banana nut bread unsweetened chocolate grape skin and plain toast peppered with cinnamon and ground espresso bean. Distinctive and evolving on the palate -- and humming along quite nicely -- until the oak turns a bit austere and aggressive on the finish. For this reason it’s my least favorite of the range."
5510,1,"A new no age statement addition to the Laphroaig family that blends together Quarter Cask PX Triple Wood and 10 year old. The nose is reminiscent of freshly-treated decking before some classic iodine creeps in. Water brings out geranium pollen and damp leather. The palate is simple clean and mild (and smoky) with bay leaf light dried fruit and that oily wood. Undoubtedly there's a lot going on but it’s not married and 40% means it lacks the necessary wallop. £35"
5511,1,"A broad and humid aroma like walking through hot bracken in the summer. Quite substantial with lemon pecan and in time chestnut. It’s this last aroma that carries through most strongly onto the tongue. There’s light grip and even at 46% some level of heat. Water reveals oak and pencil shavings/cedar while the grip has now loosened. Out comes a more crisp attack and hints of delicate top notes. The finish is pretty dry. £56"
5512,1,"It’s young Macallan. There’s a hint of sulfur (from distillate rather than cask) then wet leather Brazil nut muesli dried pineapple and raisin; even a little rubber suggestive of youth. That can’t hide the fact that this is a big deep oily dram. Water makes it considerably more coherent showing a substantial thick palate with some licorice. Ripe but you can’t help feeling that 12 is a little young for this slow-maturing distillate."
5513,6,"This cask strength bottling has been matured in oloroso sherry casks. The nose offers old leather and a slightly vegetal note along with ginger and developing toffee. The palate features unexpectedly dry sherry rapidly giving treacle plain chocolate and dark spices. Hot spices with black pepper and raisins in the lengthy finish."
5517,6,"This expression comprises peated Glenturret malt (55ppm) and some older unpeated Glenturret malt. The distillery has been making peated malt for six years. There is a higher proportion of peated malt in this revised edition than in the previous version. Farmyard aromas on the nose with an overlay of digestive biscuits and subtle smokiness. Light-bodied with watery toffee and emerging peat smoke. Medium-length in the finish spicy with cigarette smoke. £47"
5518,6,"Matured in a combination of first-fill Spanish oak sherry butts refill American oak hogsheads and first-fill bourbon barrels. The nose is initially savory with salted caramels oak vanilla and toffee. Medium-bodied with brittle toffee and spicy fruit on the creamy palate where more savory notes emerge. A hint of bourbon in the softly spiced herbal finish which darkens to black coffee. £47"
5519,6,"Formerly marketed as Glen Deveron and now rechristened the Deveron as part of owner John Dewar & Sons’ Last Great Malts initiative this 18 year old is the oldest of three releases on offer.  Oily on the nose with apricots sultanas and toffee. Dark spices merge with sweet apples walnuts and a hint of chewing tobacco on the palate. Ginger and pepper in the lengthy finish."
5520,9,"Appetizingly briny and spicy as would be expected from a Pulteney-especially on the nose. The spice notes (cinnamon licorice root vanilla) are balanced with light caramel and toffee. Quite dry polished leather finish with suggestions of bourbon. While still enjoyable I feel this would have been a better whisky if it were bottled 5-10 years ago."
5521,6,"A soft perfumed nose with orchard fruits vanilla and a lightly spiced background. Voluptuous and initially very sweet on the palate with malt and almonds then ginger and chili kick in. Lively spices and fruit-and-nut chocolate continue through the lengthy and ultimately dry finish. £55"
5522,1,"Very fresh and quite light in color suggestive of only light cask conversation. BenRiach’s fruits are there with hints of apricot even some gooseberry. Very light malty background and then a whiff of witch hazel. In time it sweetens into banana and pineapple. The palate is clean though pretty hot with that mature BenRiach fizzy spiciness on the back palate. Can’t help but feel that this would have been a great 30 year old. £95"
5523,9,"Its color suggests sherry cask influence and its aroma confirms. The initial impact on the palate is lush fruit followed by a clean honeyed malt foundation. Toffee and nuts emerge with that satisfying Bruichladdich freshness and brine kicking in on the finish providing some balance for the somewhat waxy sherried sweetness. (A Park Avenue Liquors exclusive.)"
5524,1,"An established regular member of Diageo’s annual set of Special Releases this expression celebrates the lesser-known side of Islay’s largest distillery; its production of a non-smoked expression. It was this unpeated style that saved Caol Ila during the great decimation of distilleries in the early 1980s. This example is intense and needs LOTS of water for its fragrance of cut grass sherbet and coconut water to emerge. The palate shows boiled sweets and has a pleasingly clinging quality. £53"
5525,1,"It often takes time for a new distillery to find its feet but Kilchoman’s spirit was top quality from the first day. Its limited-edition releases act as markers on a work in progress but are precociously advanced for their tender years. This the first 5 year old leads with a note like wet rushes/wet dog (that’s good!) alongside lightly turfy smoke. The palate is sweet smoked and thick with allspice on the finish. A star is born."
5526,6,"The first spirit distilled at Abhainn Dearg is now 3 years old and legally Scotch single malt whisky. The distillery has celebrated with a single cask non-colored non-chill filtered release of 2011 500 ml bottles. Apricots crystallized ginger candied peel and papier-mâché on the nose. The palate features fresh fruit spicy oak honeycomb and finally toffee. Quite short in the finish with more toffee and a nutty note. £150"
5527,6,"Jura Elixir is exclusive to the Sainsbury’s supermarket chain and takes its name from the legend that the water of Jura possesses life-prolonging qualities. Elixir was finished in a mix of American white oak and ex-sherry casks.  The nose is mildly fungal with caramel and sea salt. Treacle toffee ginger and citrus fruits on the palate which is ultimately slightly acrid. The finish is medium in length and spicy with licorice. £16 (350 ml)"
5528,1,"Full-bodied and sweet on the nose mixing burlap bran fruit cake hazelnut purée malt
extract; with water it becomes fresher and almond-like with a touch of
greengage plum. The palate has a soft feel with the thickness displayed in the
nose alongside plums and crystallized ginger. It’s just a little flabby. I’d
like a bit more freshness or grip. The finish is nutty and rich. (Travel Retail exclusive) £51/1 liter"
5529,6,"While its regular stablemate Fior contains a proportion of peated malt Fasque is unpeated and the best comparison is with the now-discontinued 12 year old ‘1824’ house bottling. The nose is fragrant with sherry cherries and vanilla. Relatively full-bodied with a rich spicy palate focusing on Jaffa oranges and dark chocolate. It dries quite quickly to black coffee and spicy licorice which linger in the mouth along with a note of toffee. £35"
5530,9,"This Caol Ila was released the same time as the 12 year old reviewed above. Older isn't always better especially with Islay whiskies. I felt that way when comparing Ardbeg 17 to Ardbeg 10 year old and I feel the same with these two Caol Ila whiskies. This 18 year old has the same flavor profile as the 12 year old. It's a well-rounded dram too but it has lost the vibrancy and dynamic intensity of the 12 year old. If you want to experience Caol Ila in its entire youthful splendor-and save a few bucks while you're at it-then buy the 12 year old."
5531,9,"Mature and gentle when compared to the 1990 expression above. If the flavors of the 1990 Caol Ila reviewed above are nakedly exposed then this Caol Ila is wearing a winter coat. The same flavor notes are there but they’re less noticeable. Pleasingly salty gently drying finish."
5532,9,"Strathisla whisky produced from peaty water to create a different variant of Strathisla. The two dominant characteristics here are ripe fruit (berries raisin pineapple citrus) and wood spices (cinnamon clove mint). The sherry cask and 33 years on oak have left their impact. The fruit and honeyed/toffee almond sweetness is to the fore with the dry spices kicking in later. They balance themselves out but I wonder what this whisky tasted like fifteen years ago before the sherry and oak took the upper hand?"
5533,9,"Light (for a Speysider) floral fresh and elegant showing honeyed vanilla and lively fruit along with a hint of marshmallow and hay. Soft dry finish. Pleasant straightforward and uncomplicated. A good clean introductory malt that’s easy to embrace."
5534,9,"Thick in texture and palate-coating. Ripe peaches and bananas orange chocolate English toffee and a hint of damp oak on the nose. I can also detect brine seaweed peat smoke and spice but it’s a little clumsy. Same story on the palate. Not a bad whisky but I expect more from Clynelish."
5535,1,"Not often seen as a single bottling here we have Speyside’s modernist distillery in typically delicate guise with plenty of subtle florals (think hyacinth and daffodils) something which is amplified with water. Imagine a cool day in early spring and you are pretty much there. The mouth is clean and fresh with a little acidity. Water doesn’t damage the palate delivery but neither does it particularly enhance things. A sorbet rather than a meal. £65"
5536,6,"This is the oldest expression of Inchmurrin to be released by Loch Lomond who make it in their highly versatile distillery at
Alexandria. Brittle toffee and cod liver oil on the nose with vanilla and a whiff of Jaffa oranges. Smooth and full on the palate more substantial and sophisticated than the younger Inchmurrin variants. The fruits are now more citric. Lengthy and unctuous in the finish with more citrus fruit gentle spice and a touch of oak. £90"
5537,9,"From a sherry hogshead which is confirmed by its deep amber/crimson color. A very clean whisky for 31 years in oak and its complexity is subtle. It’s sort of the antithesis of the Blackadder Longmorn also reviewed here. Both are heavily sherried. The Longmorn shows its age proudly and is bold complex and a bit rustic. This one is clean more conservative and nicely balanced. You’ll find notes of honey-laced fruit caramel and toffee with an infusion of nutty ginger-spiced notes leading to a polished oak finish. A straight-forward and uncomplicated Speysider."
5538,1,"More of a reddish hue but as equally robust as the 1961 (see below). Some baked characters alongside dried cherry and barberry which shift toward balsamic-like concentration. Hint of black pudding (blood sausage) and bitter chocolate. The palate is tight and tannic with a hint of smoke and cooked dried fruits. Water loosens the tannic grip allowing licorice to show. (U.S. exclusive.)"
5539,1,"A malt that was overlooked by one owner (Glenmorangie) and is now under the auspices of a new one (La Martiniquaise) beginning to ease itself back into the single malt world. Its problem has been the price: too low (see Speyburn). The standard 12 year old bottling gives a perfect idea of its potential. This is as soft and sweet a malt as you could ask for: peaches toffee and baked apple with a tobacco/cedar/pine note from the oak."
5540,1,"Thanks to the suicidal pricing policy of its previous owner Glen Moray has been considered nothing more than a bargain basement malt but at its best it is a very sweet lightly malty dram. This is as soft as a lemon cream bun in a sunlit baker’s shop. Water brings out banana chews while the tongue brings to mind a picnic with baked scones and apricot jam. The only negative is slightly needling alcohol so dilute and drink quickly. £72"
5541,1,"Bottled for this auspicious occasion this is a Glenfiddich that confounds people’s expectations by being smoky not from casks (à la Caoran) but the distillate. Fresh with a nose that brings to mind eating apples and hazelnuts around a late summer bonfire; the smoke seems in charge. On the palate the reverse happens with the fruits being thrust forward and the smoke only emerging on the finish. It’s vibrant and needs water and is a lot of fun. Happy Birthday! (Travel Retail and distillery shop exclusive)£70"
5542,1,"Diageo’s smallest distillery and another that has worm tubs. The character here is grassy: think hay and straw rather than lawn clippings. There’s just a hint of cereal behind and a fresh roasted spiciness. The palate has good central sweetness where you just get a hint of fruit. Light and fresh and a good afternoon dram. £33"
5543,1,"Another Travel Retail exclusive and while you might expect something delicate given the age statement what is delivered is a thick buttery/creamy opening that for a second teeters on the brink of sourness then pulls back to be more like ricotta cheese. It then settles into vanilla floral notes white chocolate and sweet barley. The palate is thick once again with lemon cheesecake giving a needed clean acidity. Quite a bulky youngster that’s best with water. (Travel Retail exclusive) £45"
5544,9,"Grape candy raisin blueberries vanilla malt and lavender with hints of lemon and spearmint. More aggressive campfire embers and damp earth burn underneath along with some salt. A whisky that grows on you and not bad for 7 years old."
5545,1,"The recent official release of Aultmore means that malt lovers are finally aware of the distillery’s intense grassy/perfumed character and it is these characters which are prominent here alongside a very light sherried note in the background. There appears to be real complexity on the nose for such a young example but water shows this to be the influence of the octave cask which unravels slightly when water is added. Have it neat and enjoy it a lot. £54"
5546,1,"Initially what we have are classic Caol Ila notes: cod liver oil soft pear-like fruits and a glimpse of lobster cooked in sea water. It’s not so much smoky as ozonic and though it seems a little exposed with water there’s a squeeze of lemon (for the lobster maybe). On the tongue there’s a light ashy note before the mouth is slowly filled. Any smoke is in check and understated. This is about citric freshness and salt. £70"
5547,6,"Deanston distillery has released its first organic single malt aged for 15 years in new oak barrels. It is non-chill filtered.  Stem ginger white pepper cloves and vanilla on the nose. The palate is rich with intensely sweet early fruit notes honey more ginger and now black pepper. Becoming nuttier and slightly metallic in the finish with spicy oak and a hint of aniseed. (Germany and Travel Retail) £80"
5548,6,"Released in Taiwan in 2010 15 year old Singleton of Glen Ord offers deep smooth sherry and ginger notes on the nose. There’s vanilla cocktail cherries orange malt and dark chocolate on the palate. Long in the fruity then drying finish cocoa powder and finally rather bitter oak. RM329"
5549,6,"Launched in southeast Asia in 2006 12 year old Glen Ord boasts a nose that is sweet and gingery with toffee a hint of tangerine along with vanilla sherry and oriental spices. The palate mirrors the nose with more spice then chocolate and milky coffee. Finally quite drying. RM247"
5550,6,"Soft and warm on the nose with peaches in syrup heather hazelnut and mild ginger. Quite full and richly fruity on the palate: apricots and more peaches plus stronger ginger and a hint of spicy oak. Lingering in the sweet finish with gentle spices."
5551,1,"Pale straw. An upfront and quite aromatic nose with hints of a florist’s shop—stems and blooms—with an underpinning of malt. A little gawky perhaps which water accentuates. The palate when neat is clean and mixes those flowers and some stewed apple. There’s a little green chili heat (even when diluted). A punchy little number. £36"
5552,7,"Nosing this whisky you'd never guess just how fruity it is with barnyard hay dry malt honey and light smoke. On the palate however the fruit is unmistakable with giant mango and apple. The mid-palate takes a sharp left turn into smoke and salt but the mango just won't let go. A very dry smoky finish is too dry making the case against release at this ABV. An oddball whisky that will probably only appeal to a very narrow audience. (U.S. only)"
5556,9,"Medium-bodied but viscous in texture. Clearly aged in a bourbon cask-there's plenty of honeyed malt and vanilla throughout. Hints of bourbon even peek through occasionally along with some subtle peat. Soft melon mid-palate yields to dried spice sea salt bitter chocolate and herbal notes on the finish. Fairly dry for a 12 year old-particularly on the finish. Best served as an aperitif."
5557,1,"Light straw. Initially this is quite hot and a little dumb with whiffs of Indian spice — think turmeric and curry leaf — along with mint sauce (but no lamb) and a tickle of peat. The palate is quite intense and hot with powdered almond a grassy edge and concentrated sweetness that starts in the center and builds toward the back palate. Subtle but can’t help wishing there was just a little more say from the cask. £59"
5558,9,"Light clean and delicate on the palate with creamy vanilla marshmallow soft fruit (lemon lime) and a touch of honey throughout. Nicely balanced and uncomplicated. A whisky to appeal to both the malt and blend drinker."
5559,9,"Surprisingly thick and oily in texture for a Lowlander. There’s plenty of marshmallow vanilla cream and ripe barley with interspersed cut grass lemon and mustard seed. Drying oak spice notes on the finish. Not as polished or refined as the distillery bottling of the same age but it still has many redeeming qualities."
5560,1,"A limited edition—there are only 630 bottles of this—for those who are “Glenlivet Guardians.” A sherry refill it’s a gentle expression that has typical Glenlivet floral elements that are more lifted than usual: elderflower cordial jasmine and night-scented stocks. A subtle spiciness emerges with a drop of water. This general smoothness continues on the palate with ginger in syrup and an enlivening citric note on the finish."
5561,1,"A trio of new expressions of what has become an established Islay brand. This one has a vibrant edgy opening almost like a burning lawnmower box mixed with needed oiliness (gun oil) white tea and in time the rather pleasant note of a cold fish supper. The palate is broad and though light the oils allow it to cling to the tongue as the salt lime and smoke all begin to build. A little hard but pleasantly bracing.£44"
5562,1,"At first I wondered what was going on here. This Lagavulin has more of the austerity typical of Port Ellen. There’s a tense minerality on the nose giving the impression of salty rock-pools and samphire. Water makes it sweeter and oyster-like. There’s big delivery on the tongue with masses of distillery character but that tension remains to the saline finish. In a head-to-head with Caol Ila the former wins hands down. £85"
5563,9,"rather soft whisky with gently sweet notes of vanilla marshmallow and macaroon with underlying tropical fruit cut grass and subtle spearmint. A feminine whisky to have with dessert -- or as dessert."
5564,1,"Glendullan has an unfortunate moniker. Any whisky with ‘dull’ in the middle of its name will always struggle in English-speaking markets. It’s a shame because it’s always delivered a gentle sweet lightly fruity/estery style making it an ideal lunchtime dram. This ticks all those boxes. Green apples are there as is cinnamon alongside a racy acidity before water brings out more scented aromas. The finish is short but it does its job as an easy-drinking everyday malt. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
5565,9,"Gordon & MacPhail purchased the Benromach distillery from United Distillers and reopened the distillery in 1998. They installed new stills and are using malt with a recognizable level of peating. This is first official bottling from the whisky that they themselves have made. The whisky is still youthful but for a whisky of such youth it shows great balance individuality and promise. Notes of vanilla cream honey and fruit (pineapple pear) are peppered with nuances of smoke herbs and pine. Youthful vibrant finish. I eagerly look forward to tasting this whisky with a half dozen more years of aging."
5566,9,"Nicely balanced and easy to drink. Pit fruits (peaches apricots) and lemon are the dominant notes with underlying vanilla cream butterscotch and a hint of honey. Gently dry delicately spicy finish. The most rounded of the four."
5567,9,"Succulent sappy with plenty of oak. This whisky is quite fruity with tangerine lemon and strawberries. It is balanced by fat barley almonds and damp oak. It is not as polished and rounded as the Gordon & Macphail Longmorn reviewed above. Indeed the fruity damp oak notes can be quite dominant in this whisky. However the whisky evolves constantly on the palate and there are some minty spicy underlying notes which add intrigue. Definitely save this one for after dinner."
5568,9,"Full gold color. Layers of citrus fruit on the nose (especially Seville orange lemon grapefruit) with just a faint hint of peat smoke and floral herbal notes. Light to medium in body. It tastes similar in many ways to its aroma-there’s plenty of citrus fruit. The fruit comes first followed by the classic ""older Bowmore"" oaky dryness. An echo of flavors repeats this sequence-first the citrus fruit then the dry oak flavors. Some peat smoke teases in the background but is mostly restrained. Fry oaky faintly peaty finish. This whisky is classic older Bowmore (30+ years) with its exotic citrus fruit distinctive oaky dryness and faintest hint of peat smoke."
5569,1,"Bowmore in unusually oily guise here with linseed oil hot seashells background water mint completely integrated smoke and a cooling note that brings to mind a lido (without any chlorine I hasten to add). The palate has a limey lift which flows into a quite thick creamy/oaty mid-palate with the smoke bedding itself on the tongue. Smoky and mineralic on the finish. Water makes it even more gentle. A light expression for the early morning. £98"
5570,6,"A single cask (#10699) bottling of Talisker distilled in the winter of 2008 and matured in a refill hogshead before bottling in May 2015. Initially a slight hint of new make soon displaced by digestive biscuits brine and black pepper. Sweet oak earthy peat and orchard fruits on the palate. The finish is medium in length with black coffee licorice and long-lasting spices."
5571,6,"Douglas Laing has added a no age statement bottling of Talisker to its Provenance range tagging it as “Young and Feisty.” It comprises whisky from casks #10227 and 10229. Lively and up front with bubblegum wood smoke and black pepper on the nose. Developing ozone. Zesty soft fruits emerging dark peat notes and more pepper on the palate. The finish is quite short nutty and slightly metallic. Young and feisty indeed! £65"
5572,9,"A whisky very typical of this distillery which has been silent since 1998. Rich and thick on the nose and palate; oozing vanilla ripe malt cotton candy powdered sugar new-mown hay and lemon tart. Cinnamon evergreen and a wisp of smoke round out the palate. An evolving whisky -- starts out heavy and sweet then turns clingingly dry. A fun rare whisky for a reasonable price."
5573,1,"As cask strength examples of young Bowmore — sold at a very keen price — the small-batch Tempest range is already picking up a cult following. This third release does not disappoint in the smoke department while the nose also shows some orange zest aromas. That said it is a little restrained showing its youth with a pea pod-like character on the palate while its fruits are emerging but aren’t fully ripened. More of a strong breeze than a tempest."
5574,1,"Originally a one-off bottling for Friends of the Classic Malts ‘Moch’ (Gaelic for dawn though the association between daybreak and the dram is beyond me — one for the morning ‘skailk’ maybe?) appears to have taken the place of the Cask Strength expression. It shows a saline seashell-like freshness light smoke. and a pleasant mix of salami and grassiness. The palate is clean and intense with a continuation of that oyster liquor character. Great in a smoky Highball. £36"
5575,9,"A very traditional Rosebank-aged in a refill hogshead and bottled fairly young (12 years old). Rosebank is one of the better yet lesser known Lowland single malts. Since the distillery was closed down in 1993 it will continue being unfamiliar to most and finding young Rosebanks like this one will become increasingly more difficult. Here’s one at cask strength. The whisky turns very cloudy with the addition of water due to lack of chill filtering but the additional water brings out the whisky’s subtle aromas and flavors-fresh cut grass hay delicate fruit and a gentle malty sweetness. Ironically I actually enjoyed some of the recent young G&M Rosebanks bottled at 40% ABV better than this one-their flavors were cleaner brighter and more refined. Still this is a fair representation of the Lowland style."
5576,1,"Not satisfied with trying different levels of peating and cask types the folks at BenRiach are also utilizing triple distillation. This expression has spent three years in oloroso sherry butts although for me there’s more a mix of honey and cream and light orchard fruits than any overt fruitcake. The palate is clean and fresh and lifted. Good energy. £50"
5577,1,"Light gold. Fresh and clean with light draff notes. Cool porcelain lemon cereal husk. It becomes more expressive on the tongue though it remains subtle. A bit of a stealth bomb because the palate shows plenty of spice cinnamon toast and baklava. The finish reveals some green notes. When you add water it becomes incredibly minty. Fragile but if you fancy a Bunna' julep then look no further. £69"
5578,1,"Released to celebrate the Ardbeg space mission this is a mix of 1990 Ardbeg from bourbon and Marsala casks and it’s the latter which make the running from the start. Earthy with blackberry and fruitcake and sooty peatiness in the background. While there’s a medicinal/herbal note with water the palate has a damp wood edge. Fortified wine can work with peat but here there’s a clash between distillery character and the Marsala cask. Sadly a disappointment."
5579,6,"Despite close proximity to Islay stylistically Jura make has far more in common with its Highland cousins. The entry level 10 year old variant offers resin oil cereal and pine notes on the delicate nose. Comparatively light bodied with malt and drying saltiness in the mouth along with a hint of aniseed. The finish is malty and nutty with more salt plus just a wisp of smoke."
5580,6,"This could be seen as a brave young bottling of the sometimes divisive Fettercairn single malt but Glenkeir Treasures has acquired some interesting casks which showcase the youthful whisky to good advantage. Wet cardboard starch and savory notes on the initial nose settling down to something fruitier and with milk chocolate. Floral nutty and slightly peppery on the palate with almonds toffee cocoa powder and gentle citrus fruit. Quite soft in the finish with elegant spices and milky coffee. (Whisky Shop only) £35/500 ml"
5581,9,"This Speyside distillery was closed in 1983. Very pale in color mouth-coating but not heavy or cloying. A clean whisky that emphasizes its sweeter notes with honeyed malt ripe barley butterscotch and vanilla. Subtle notes of cinnamon lemon grass and fruit in syrup. A dried oak-spice finish provides balance."
5582,1,"There is something very bedtime drink about this Glenallachie without it being a dram to have before retiring for the night. It’s to do with the aromatic sensation of powdered malted milk and cocoa powder. The palate is simple with some fresh apple pear juice and a lightly sour edge. The draff/malted milk re-emerges in the middle of the tongue. With water pears come through making it similar to a tequila blanco. All rather delicate. £63"
5583,9,"Very fragrant and perfumed on the nose. Chewy and syrupy on the palate with layers of sweetness (toffee caramel fudge) roasted almonds and raisins. A drying resinous spice finish saves the sweetness from being too dominant. Call me sentimental but I just remembered the old Campbell Distillers 10 year old bottling which expressed so much more finesse and was cleaner and not as heavy and cluttered."
5584,9,"This Glencraig along with Mosstowie (reviewed below) were experimentations with ""Lomond"" stills where the top of the stills were replaced with a rectifying column allowing several different styles of whiskies to be produced at the same distillery. The Lomond stills were eventually removed. This is a very creamy malt with an oily texture. Notes of bananas and cream ripe barley caramel graham cracker and orange creamsicle. Dry spicy finish. The fruity zing in this whisky shows that it still has some life in it. A dessert whisky indeed."
5585,1,"Light amber. The nose offers up walnut bread spelt flour and a green malty note. Overall it’s slightly unyielding with toasted oak hazelnut and barley. Water opens up a sweeter core: Lucozade apricot kernel and barley. The palate is where the apricot flesh turns up but then it firms up quickly snuffing that moment of levity out. Water introduces lemon before it becomes very gingery on the finish. It’s the thing about Tormore; it just can’t let itself go. (France only) €42"
5586,1,"The finish in question here is Muscatel casks and you can tell that from the start as the nose is filled with a rich sweet and very pronounced dusky fruitiness — sloes and plums. The smoke as a result is diminished as are the grassy/bacony notes. While the smoke does emerge from its fruity bubble on the tongue the effect is almost liqueur-like. It’s a very pleasing dram but the question is is it Caol Ila?"
5587,9,"A distillery bottling of Ardmore finally comes to the U.S. This one is non-chill filtered and finished in a “Quarter Cask” similar to Laphroaig Quarter Cask (same owners). Ardmore remains one of the few Speyside whiskies made with peat-smoked malt. Chewy almost oily-textured with sweet notes of toffee and caramel up front followed by emerging damp earthy peat and bourbon-like notes. The oaky resinous bourbon lingers through the finish. The bourbon oak intensity dominates to a degree disrupting the harmony of the remaining flavors. A whisky of great potential but still waiting to achieve some of it."
5588,1,"The latest in Chivas Bros. no age statement (NAS) variant of their malts and while the nose here does have Longmorn’s fruity elements they are discreet. This is also the case on the palate where what is usually thick elegant and fruity has had its volume turned down. Blind it’s a nice dram but I don’t want nice from Longmorn I want great. £47"
5589,9,"Aged in a re-charred sherry butt. Sweet but not cloying with plenty of fruit throughout. Toffee vanilla fudge roasted chestnuts and nougat enhanced by glazed peaches burnt pineapple dark cherry pits and subtle anise. Gripping charred oak tannins emerge mid-palate and continue on the finish detracting from an otherwise very pleasant experience. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot)"
5590,1,"One of a trio from Chivas Bros. who every year release limited editions of 500 ml cask strength bottlings from a selection of its estates. These are predominantly only for sale on site or by mail order through www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com.

This distillery is located amongst the fertile barley-growing fields of the Laich O’Moray. Though modern in look it actually dates back to 1810. This is a classic introduction to its fresh zesty style which plays an important role in the Ballantine’s blends. Think cut grass green apple pine pear drops and a whiff of freshly-starched linen. This energy carries on to the mouth where apple is the dominant flavor along with green walnut and a zippy acidity. £34"
5591,1,"Another Glen Moray this time in a substantially different guise than normal. Yes this is fresh sweet and malty — to be precise draff-like — but there’s smoke as well and a fairly decent belt of it. Young it may be — amazingly it’s less than 2 years old — but the palate especially with water is cleansing and with vanilla good phenols and orris-like dryness. Very intriguing. £18 (200 ml)"
5592,9,"Light and clean with citrus tropical fruit (coconut pineapple ripe banana) white chocolate and honeyed vanilla resting on a clean malty foundation. Soft on the finish. An easy-going whisky."
5593,1,"The onionskin hue gives the initial indication that this was finished in a port pipe. The nose is light and fruity: raspberry and cranberry juice even a sprig of mint. Fresh but with a background funkiness. In time there’s ripe melon then lightly musty wood comes through. The palate is light giving the effect of diluted fruit juice. It’s all just a bit lacking in weight. £25"
5594,1,"One of the newest of the Distillers Edition family. Here Royal Lochnagar has been given its secondary resting period in Muscat casks. That nodule of sweetness in the 12 year old has been picked up and extended into a more perfumed world; think blueberry muffin and boysenberry jam. The slight sour/bitter note is a positive but I think in this case that the finish dominates proceedings and needs to be scaled down a little. £48"
5595,1,"Like being stuck inside the Dailuaine dark grains plant: all Marmite (yeast extract spread) deglazed roasting pan and a cereal note. In other words the distillery character is the major contributor. Some light nuttiness but overall this is Dailuaine in funky guise. Becomes more errr…agricultural with water. Robust and peppery on the tongue. A nice example albeit without massive complexity."
5596,1,"Though the color suggests good cask activity the initial approach shows a dram that seems slightly unfocused and youthful. There are some kernel-like cereal elements and very little smokiness with touches of salt and oil. The feeling is that it’s only starting to blossom — and there is a floral element — and has been bottled too early. It’s all very focused lifted and aromatic but when compared to the Adelphi you can’t help but wonder whether the same distillery is involved."
5597,6,"This expression from Macduff distillery was launched along with its 12 and 18 year old siblings in 2015. The nose is fresh and floral and offers light cereal notes and soft malt. The palate yields new-mown hay toffee apples and quite sweet oak. The finish is medium in length and softly spiced. (France only) €21"
5598,6,"Signature was new to the Singleton of Glen Ord range in 2013 as part of the Travel Retail exclusive Singleton Reserve Collection. Soft toffee banana and ginger on the nose accompanied by slightly herbal and pine notes. Sweet and easy-drinking with a suggestion of sherry and drying oak. Licorice in the finish. RM263"
5599,6,"Rich on the nose with damp tweed malt and a suggestion of earthiness. Finally salted butter. The palate offers muted tropical fruits soft gingery oak and more earthiness. In the finish the oak becomes more overt without dominating."
5600,6,"Surprisingly the most reticent nose of the three Inchmurrins. Mild orchard fruit apple blossom cocoa powder and a hint of nutmeg. Initially red grapes and almonds on the palate with the fruit then darkening to raisins and developing oak. The finish is long spicy dry and oaky with persistent background fruitiness trying to break through."
5601,1,"Pale straw. The nose is very draff-like/sweet mash then green herbal notes reminiscent of angelica. The palate remains light and slightly hot on the tongue with some cereal and a certain fatness. Water brings out a little more from the cask. A delicate and pleasant enough dram but I’m slightly bemused as to why it’s being bottled at this age when there’s clearly so much more to give. £69"
5602,1,"Very pale straw. The color indicates that there’s been no real cask activity. A little closed on the nose to start; clean quite green and leafy (young ferns). The flavor however makes up for this with good mid-palate sweetness and some dark fruits beginning to assemble themselves in the middle. Of interest to completists. £45"
5603,1,"There’s a Roman dish involving lamb cooked in milk and this is it in alcohol form. A slightly peculiar lactic note rises and falls above the rich meatiness of the spirit. There’s a hit of pencil shavings but with water it becomes cheesy. So much more straightforward on the tongue with good vinous weight like an old Vin Jaune. It finishes with earthy tones. It’s just…odd. £125"
5604,9,"Pleasantly sweet. Good malt foundation with an abundance of bright summer fruit. Clean straight-forward and uncomplicated."
5605,1,"A slightly perfumed nose offers up the slightly unusual pairing of dried lavender sweet-cured herring and then potpourri air freshener. This flies off to show wet dulse on warm sand. It starts sweetly with some nutmeg then hot peppers. The smoke is very light allowing a tantalizing glimpse of soft guava before the salinity returns. Water brings out the peat kiln but also that initial perfume. Muddled. £700"
5606,1,"Quite a solid start for a Caol Ila which like the 30 year old (see above) pitches you into the farmyard though this time it’s a sheep-shearing shed. There’s also some bacon and spent barbecue. The initial impression is of a pretty dry example but some oil begins to seep through. The palate is explosive with some engine oil becoming pretty flinty with violet notes and the distillery sweetness is hidden. A little disjointed. £135"
5607,9,"A single cask bottling of The Glenrothes aged in a first-fill sherry cask. Only 519 bottles all destined for the U.S. It is the richest chewiest sweetest and fruitiest of all the Glenrothes whiskies reviewed here. Deep mahogany color with notes of toffee apples waxed fruit burnt orange prunes in syrup and dark chocolate. The intensity of the sherry and length of oak-aging gives the whisky a flavor profile that begins to transcend traditional whisky flavors expressing notes of port wine pot-still rum and rancio."
5608,6,"A new NAS expression from Scapa on Orkney matured entirely in first-fill American oak casks. An initial hint of lime cordial then musty peaches almonds cinnamon and table salt. More peaches on the palate with tinned pear and a little honey. Tingling spices in the drying finish which soon becomes quite bitter – detracting from the overall balance."
5609,9,"Sweet ripe barley balanced by damp peat tar and burning embers. Some spice notes (pepper anise) linger on the finish. While enjoyable now some of the flavors seem to behave more like individual solos rather than harmony. I think they will begin to integrate nicely by the time this generation of Ledaig reaches its teens."
5610,1,"Quite hot on the nose with a little oak on show here alongside garam masala. The effect is of dried fish and seaweed Brazil nut and bread basket. It needs water. In the mouth it’s tense when neat giving you the sense of it straining to express itself fully but being constricted by alcohol. Firm and bold but even with water it’s a little too dry."
5611,6,"Another youthful offering from Douglas Laing in its Premier Barrel series presented in one of 863 ceramic decanters. This Glengoyne initially offers a nose of cherries and treacle before tinned tomatoes make their presence felt. Tangy fruits on the palate malt and spicy sausage. Caramel spices and a hint of oak in the finish. An interesting contrast to the older more sherry cask-focused Glengoyne ‘house’ bottlings. £65"
5612,6,"Following a similarly youthful Provenance range bottling of Talisker and an NAS “Young and Feisty” variant Douglas Laing has opted to release this 5 year old expression in its Premier Barrel lineup complete with ceramic decanter 495 of which were produced. Initially meaty then peat smoke envelops the nose with damp tweed backing it up. Black pepper and gunpowder tea on the bold palate; flinty with lemon and lime. Lingering black pepper and a metallic tang in the finish. £75"
5613,9,"Rich and sweet with toffee coconut cream Turkish delight nougat and honey. Ripe black raspberries citrus and dried spice (vanilla fennel and evergreen mint) provide complexity and attempt to balance all the sweetness. A pleasant dram but I wish there was a little more to prop up all that sweetness. A whisky for those with a sweet tooth. Good with dessert as dessert or with a cigar."
5614,9,"Reddish amber color. Aromas of honey drenched fruit toffee and fudge. Medium to heavy in body. Rich and sweet in flavor (toffee fudge caramel) with interwoven notes of rich ripe fruit. Lingering toffee sweetness on the finish."
5615,9,"Highland (Isle of Arran) single malt scotch Color: Straw Gold Aroma: Youthful. Pears in syrup honeysuckle and vanilla with a hint of caramel and citrus. Palate: Vibrant somewhat youthful flavors that echo its aroma finishing slightly sweet and a little fiery (because of its age). General Comments: The lack of chill-filtering certainly makes this whisky more flavorful and dynamic than its filtered brethren. It also tastes a little more mature. This shows how a whisky can be affected by chill-filtering. I expect this whisky to continue improving with additional aging. Available nationwide."
5616,9,"Caramelized fruity notes of mandarin pineapple golden raisin and plum. Heathery honey notes add an additional sweet dimension as do some light toffee and nougat. A dusting of cocoa powder emerges occasionally. Like the other 15 year olds this one is quite sherried thick and heavy on the palate. (Bottled for Hi-Time Wine Cellars)"
5617,9,"Thick and syrupy on the palate. Notes of marshmallow creamy vanilla caramel honey drenched fruit almond liqueur and coconut macaroon. Liquid dessert."
5618,1,"Think of sponge fingers soaked in cream and you’re not far off the initial aroma. Add in light macadamia-like nuttiness a drift of mint and Glenlivet’s signature apple — core not green. As it opens it becomes woodier like a brush pile. The palate has sweet pure pear-like fruit that initially keeps the oak in balance. It seems to need water but when it’s added the oak takes over. Good but a little tired. £102"
5619,1,"A similar story to the 30 year old. Despite a truly excellent nose this time more sherry influences dominate: think of polished wood damsons and a little menthol/camphor and resinous oak. Once again the palate seems to be slightly dumber than I’d want from a venerable whisky that should be about elegant complex expression. It’s balanced just a little faded. Again maybe higher strength might have done the trick. £140"
5620,4,"This isn’t the easiest to fall for. It’s stewed swampy a big feisty take-no-prisoners whisky with oxtail soup spicy tomato and meat broth on the nose then black treacle praline cayenne and paprika. A rootsy prune juice is part of the finish. Challenging and tough. £67 [Dominic Roskrow]"
5621,1,"Or ‘Fumabat Porticus’ as it should be called—smoky whisky in a port cask—not that you need to be told that when you see the color. The port takes the upper hand on the nose giving a layer of black raspberry sloe and cranberry sauce. The smoke hangs in the background. This juicy fruitiness carries through to the tongue where the smoke now adds much-required dry balance. The higher alcohol also stops it becoming too jammy. £59"
5622,1,"The oldest of the new trio here you can see how the smoke has become fully absorbed accenting the peapod and spearmint giving depth to the still-fresh ozonic elements. There are light levels of complexity even a little chocolate. The tongue when neat goes deep into pear and apple but it’s edgy. Adding water however shows the lack of oak integration. I’d want more from a whisky of this age (and price). £199"
5623,1,"As with the 30 year old here you get the sense of smoke being absorbed rather than being expressive. There’s not a lot of cask at work here—this has real minerality and an oily brininess bringing to mind a hot outboard motor on a fishing trip. Halfway in a fire ignites sending clouds of smoke forward but then it dries too quickly. Good but just not enough oak to give it depth and length. £80"
5624,1,"Comus is the name of a frankly terrifying English folk group who taps into the dark pagan spirit underpinning that music. An apposite name then for the Laddie’s most heavily-peated variant. If you want to know what it’s like to stand beside a kiln then sniff this but the distillery’s sweetness is retained here in the guise of pineapple and banana. The palate is like eucalyptus lozenges with light maltiness before that Laddie thickness makes things even sweeter."
5625,1,"Light gold in color the roasted almond notes that start the nose show the influence of the amontillado sherry finish before your nose is filled with the contents of a spice merchant’s chest alongside unusually a light maritime note. Very gentle and clean in the mouth with sour plum and a generally amenable nature. More like this please Burn Stewart! £60"
5626,1,"A mix of bourbon and quarter casks finished in Pedro Ximenez this new release is initially only for Travel Retail. The problem with finishing peaty whiskies is that all you can do is reduce the smoke but here it’s done with as much subtlety as you can when dealing with PX. Think treacle scones raisins and tarry tobacco. A thick mid-palate gives an effect like an old-fashioned medicine. A sweet-hearted dragon smoldering in its seashore cave. (Travel Retail exclusive) £60"
5627,9,"Perhaps the oldest BenRiach on the market. I have great respect for whisky that has somehow managed to survive this many years without being bottled. If you want to taste a piece of history (which I can understand) and have unlimited funds then go ahead and buy this. But for the money I prefer the BenRiach 25 year old (or even the 30 year old) to this whisky. Deeply layered oak -- from dried spicy oak to juicy damp oak. Notes of perfumed vanilla roasted chestnut and orange marmalade accentuate the oak. Pretty good for 40 but its best years are behind it."
5628,9,"Clean fresh and uncomplicated. Honeyed malt peaches and cream with subtle floral and lime notes. Dry herbal oaky finish with a hint of bitter chocolate. A warm-weather whisky or as an aperitif."
5629,1,"The double maturation here is a vatting of bourbon and sherry casks finished off in what Diageo will only say is a “special” cask. That’s helpful. There’s a breakfast-style opening here of warm bagels with grape jelly then comes citrus before some of that dusky distillery character creeps in. It’s quite bulked-up in the center of the palate but finishes cleanly. One for those who like things on the thick-set side. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
5630,1,"Bunnahabhain’s peaty expression is steadily coming together. It’s been one of those drams that seems to need more time than many but that’s true of Bunna’ in general come to think of it. In fact the peatiness is quite mild on the nose adding some scent to the sandalwood elements and obvious raisined sweetness. There’s a slightly cheesy note in the background and a touch of sulphur on the palate. It’s not quite wholly integrated but progressing well. (Fèis Ìle 2016 833 bottles) £95"
5631,1,"The annual Cairdeas release aims to show Laphroaig in a new light. Initially I thought this too sweet and cask dominated with the distillery battling against the wine—fresh red fruit and seaweed is a test even for the best chef. Add water and give it time though and there is this lightly exotic herbal hazelnut-like element. It lacks depth and the tarry thump beloved by many Laphroaig lovers but is an interesting departure."
5632,1,"Drawn from a refill barrel this is Balvenie all eager and bright at the start of its journey. It’s like an excited kid eating pancakes and runny honey (with a squeeze of lemon juice) at breakfast on her first day of school. There’s a hint of malt a little peachiness and a hint of the richness that will develop resonance in time. It’s lovely—I’d be happy to drink a couple—but way overpriced. The score has to reflect that. £400"
5633,1,"Stiùireadair means “helmsman” in Gaelic. This has been finished for a year in Marsala casks. The nose is all garden compost moist vegetation light smoke and highly oxidized: like a young vin santo (or indeed Marsala). Very nutty with an almost vermouth-like quality. The palate is all clove anise cherry stone. Those oxidized wine notes are so dominant it’s shifted the balance toward the finish. This particular helmsman’s somewhat off course. £95"
5634,1,"Here is Benrinnes in very summery guise with its signature meatiness barely discernible. Instead you get lots of thyme rosemary and dried citrus peel. The palate is clean and concentrated with a tart drive akin to red currant. It is this jangly effect which shows the need for dilution. Water does improve things and while the sour fruits are still there the effect is more calm. It does lack length though. £65"
5635,9,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Gold Aroma: Fresh and youthful. Citrus fruit honey vanilla ginger and a hint of smoke. Palate: Youthful and on the light side for a Macallan. Notes of citrus ginger root honey and smoke. The whisky finishes rather quicky."
5636,4,"Another whisky that will not disappoint fans of the brand but it doesn’t do enough to bring any converts on board. The nose is fresh and sweet with barley and ginger and not much else. The taste is perfectly acceptable and at this strength better than the standard bottling. Water brings out a sweet malt and barley core some gentle spice and a rich sweetness."
5637,9,"Very pale in color. A creamy mouthcoating whisky with thick vanilla as the main thread. Quite dry given its creaminess. I’m also picking up a lot of gin botanicals (especially juniper and orange peel). An interesting enough of a dram but not something I would drink on a regular basis."
5638,9,"Aged in bourbon oak and then finished in Guigal Hermitage Rouge Syrah wine casks. Bright notes of red raspberry rhubarb currant plum and (not surprisingly) grape with background notes of vanilla and caramel. I find the syrah notes entertaining on the nose but too dominant on the palate for balance. The fruit becomes waxy and hides a lot of Bruichladdich subtle complexities. (Bottled exclusively for The Party Source.)"
5639,1,"London-based specialist The Whisky Exchange won’t reveal where its main Islay brand is distilled though the smart money is on a distillery not that far away from the ferry terminal that gives it its name. This expression is less phenolic than you might expect; there’s more rapeseed oil than smoke but it does have a nori wrap shoreline character. The palate is discreet with pineapple and creaminess leading the way toward a bonfire made of old fishboxes. £60"
5640,1,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. The nose immediately betrays the fact that this has been matured in a first-fill sherry hogshead. It’s akin to an artisan’s workshop all leather oil and strange resins. There’s an intriguing hint of curry spices and truffle but all in all this is about density black fruits (damson) allspice and clove. The cask is in charge. The palate has more tannin than you perhaps want — powerful and grippy with lots of nut and tea-like tannins; too grippy for me. £500"
5641,9,"Very pale. A little thin in body sharp and penetrating. Very Caol Ila-like with notes of damp peat Greek olives seaweed mustard seed incense gin herbs freshly ground pepper and vanilla malt. Smoldering peat finish. I would like to see more body to this whisky. (634 bottles produced.)"
5642,6,"Inchmurrin has enjoyed a higher profile since early 2013 when the range was extended to include 15 18 and 21 year old
expressions. The lineup also boasts striking new packaging and is bottled non-chill filtered. Orange fondant cream and peaches on the nose with caramel in the background. Fuller-bodied than the 15 year old expression with pineapple cheesecake and ginger on the palate. The finish is quite long and spicier and more peppery than that of the 15 year old bottling (also reviewed this issue). £70"
5643,9,"Enjoyable creamy texture and medium-bodied. Gently sweet notes of light toffee and vanilla custard especially towards the front of the palate. Nutty too with some sultana in the background. Gentle oak notes towards the finish. A very clean well-balanced whisky that’s very easy to drink but also takes few risks."
5644,1,"Craigellachie is one of Scotland’s most interesting distilleries: its worm tubs providing a deliberately sulfury new make whose aromas flash off after maturation to reveal a deeply floral pineapple-accented palate. Here sadly an inactive cask has meant that cabbagey sulfur has not been fully worked out. The fleshiness of the mature spirit is emerging but this should have been kept in cask for another five years or so. Lacks balance and maturity. £60"
5645,1,"Bottled as one of last year’s Diageo Special Releases this is very minty to start: mint chocolate to be precise before Brazil nut and toasted bran appear given balance by creamy oak. This mix of nuts and sweetness continues on the tongue alongside an early burst of strawberry but the center and back palate are foosty (as we say in Scotland) or dusty as you probably do."
5646,1,"This is coming from a first fill sherry hogshead so there’s little surprise that the color is as dark as pitch. This is Glenfarclas at its most concentrated; less about dried fruit and more about highly-roasted espresso with a glass of ancient Marsala on the side. The palate shows firm grip moving into astringency. Too much cask for me but if this is what rocks your boat go for it! £840"
5647,9,"Not immature but very intense and unabashed. Sweet barley notes and vanilla are beaten up by coal tar damp kiln smoke and fiery spice on the finish. For those who like their Islay whiskies young. Very young. I would have waited a couple more years before bottling this one. Pure testosterone. (Bottled for Maxwell Street Trading Co.)"
5648,9,"Matured in a refill sherry cask. (A first-fill sherry cask would have completely dominated Rosebank’s delicate flavor profile.) With the addition of water (which is necessary) the whisky becomes quite cloudy. Rosebank’s traditional honeyed vanilla grass/hay and soft fruit are accentuated by lightly sherried soft toffee flavors. An interesting whisky but the flavors are not clean and well-defined enough to warrant a higher rating."
5649,9,"Plenty of citrus zest along with subtle pineapple and coconut on the nose. The palate begins with honeyed-malt sweetness followed by the citrus fruit but then quickly turns dry and resinous with dried nuts and spicy oak on the finish. The intensity of the dryness on the finish surprised me and detracted from an otherwise well-rounded dram."
5650,6,"Bottled as part of Douglas Laing’s Single Minded range which focuses on young small batch bottlings this 8 year old Jura matured in two refill sherry butts after being distilled in April 2006. Pear drops pine nuts and damp woodland on the nose. The palate is light and fruity though dark spices and aniseed soon emerge. Peppery oak in the dry finish. £33"
5651,9,"Lushly fruity and quite sweet. A bit too sappy on the nose but more even-keeled on the palate. The fruit notes (nectarine plum orange marmalade) sit on a bed of caramel shortbread and thick honey with chocolate-covered almonds emerging on the finish. For those who like their Highland Park youthful and very sherried. (Bottled for Grape Vine Market)"
5652,9,"This whisky is not as good as the similarly-aged more polished and refined standard distillery-bottled 25 year old cask-strength expression (our ""Whisky of the Year"" several years ago). This single cask bottling from a sherry cask is intensely sherried. Sappy fruit notes dominate the palate. Damp somewhat tired oak notes are prevalent throughout. The whisky is also nutty with heathery peat notes emerging occasionally. The floral heather-honeyed grace treasured in Highland Park struggles to emerge and ultimately loses the battle. (Bottled exclusively for Park Avenue Liquors.)"
5653,9,"Rich and viscous in texture. Sappy waxed fruit maple syrup and nougat. Becoming quite nutty with emerging notes of damp peat dates plum and blueberry. The sherry is fairly dominant and masks some of the whisky's subtleties. After dinner with a cigar perhaps? (Bottled exclusively for Beltramo's.)"
5654,1,"Shy is the word. Pale in color again suggestive of little cask interaction. There’s a little hint of white currant and light cereal delicate and fragile — more fragile than the Balmenach — with a little touch of white chocolate. As it opens out comes violet. The mouth is tense as if everything is still baled up even after all this time. Very light acidity gives a certain freshness that water doesn’t shake loose. Simply not enough cask. £67"
5655,9,"A peculiar Auchentoshan. The Bordeaux wine dominates with its distinctive winery aroma and flavor. Red raspberry red currant and a hint of strawberry comprise the core of this whisky with underlying notes of vanilla cream cocoa and a hint of demerara rum. The whisky spent nine of its years in Bordeaux wine casks. I would have preferred less time in the wine casks for such a delicate whisky."
5656,9,"Jura’s newest offering and the oldest in the portfolio. It is drastically different than its younger siblings-this one is quite sherried as its deep amber color with reddish hues suggests. I really enjoy how this whisky tastes on the palate-it’s rich and silky with notes of fruitcake toffee maple orange chocolate truffle cinnamon and nutmeg. You’ll find the same notes on the nose but there are also elements-cloying fruit perfume and a peculiar fleshy component-which detract from an otherwise lovely whisky."
5657,9,"Dominant notes of citrus (lemon lime) and other tropical fruits (coconut mango) on the nose. On the palate the whisky is simple and uncomplicated. The entry is soft and malty and then it becomes dry and gently oaky. Not overly inspiring but those who purchase the whisky for its rarity value (the distillery closed in 1983) shouldn’t be discouraged from actually drinking the stuff some day."
5658,9,"There’s no age statement but the whisky is less than 10 years old -- and is a little green. Notes of toffee almonds ripe fruit freshly-ground pepper chorizo bacon fat and damp peat smoke. Lingering smoke and brine on the finish. A few more years of maturation should improve this whisky significantly."
5659,9,"Quite palate-coating for a Lowlander with sweet notes of vanilla malt grist honey and marshmallow. More subtle notes of cut grass linseed oil rubber erasers and chalky antacid tablets. A peculiar-tasting whisky."
5660,1,"Amber in hue this starts off very succulent and approachable with some butterscotch vanilla and caramel toffee but like its brother it dries. The palate is lighter than the 14 year old and seems to float lacking an anchor. When it does come down it does so with a cereal crunch. Water lightens it still further just leaving a mix of oak and cereal and an astringent finish. (France only) €56"
5661,1,"A 1992 ‘Rothes finished in a peated cask this shows immediate smoke along with some cellar notes. Behind is some laurel and a light lemon touch. It has surprising intensity. It’s all very clean and fresh but while the smoke is there it wanders about in a somewhat distracted fashion. Like the recent Glenlivet peated cask offering it just lacks integration. Maybe if you want smoke you should peat the barley. Who’da thunk it? £42"
5662,1,"Finishing in octave-sized PX casks has resulted in the creation of an oddity: the world’s first Ardbeg cordial. There’s smoke pigskin leather and a sudden rootiness mixed with damp woodland stewing Victoria plums and a weirdly lactic note. This continues on the tongue giving an effect like smoked cream cheese dotted with raisins. Hmm…£120/500 ml"
5663,1,"Somewhat sidelined thanks to the presence of Glenrothes and Glen Grant (not to mention Speyburn) in the same village Glen Spey gets on with producing fillings for numerous Diageo blends (primarily J&B). As a result it’s rarely seen as a single malt with even independent bottlings pretty thin on the ground.
This 21 year old is the color of old gold and while the nose initially surprises with a hint of suet dumplings there’s a rich and dangerously hedonistic sweetness behind which is strangely hard to pin down. Coconut cream? Suntan lotion? Blackening butter in a frying pan? Eventually it appears to settle in the crème brûlée area along with a fruity base (sweet of course). There’s a light green note that suggests it might be distillery character coming through but water suggests it’s new wood. 
In the mouth there’s vanilla fudge and toffee before a hint of muesli alongside dried mango. Overall it’s a bit like eating breakfast in a new ski chalet. Showy and impressive but for me the wood’s in charge."
5664,6,"This bottling from an unspecified Highland distillery is intended to represent the style of whisky to be produced in the Raasay distillery currently under construction.  Peated to a level of 15ppm this expression has been finished in Tuscan red wine casks.  4000 bottles are available. Buttery farmyard aromas with red berries and a sense of relative youth.  Silky on the palate with intense fruit sweetness and an immediate delivery of very spicy peat. Pepper and peat in a medium-length finish. £55"
5665,7,"Distilled at the start of 2009 this special edition was bottled mid-2014 making it a 5 ½ year old whisky. The nose is ashy paste with a good measure of barnyard funk along with sherry oak and clove spice. The entry is all ashtray a late night of sweet wine and cigarettes. Sherry notes fight the smoke to emerge but the smoke simply dominates. A smoky ashy spicy and dry finish round out a face-slapper of a whisky. (U.S. only)"
5666,6,"Inchmurrin is one of many single malts produced by Loch Lomond. It is made using lightly peated malt and matured in bourbon casks and is named after one of the islands in Loch Lomond. Caramac chocolate and peanut butter on the sweet fruity nose. The fruit motif continues on to the palate where spicy malt vanilla and ripe peaches predominate. The finish is medium in length and nutty. £50"
5667,9,"Only moderately peated (15ppm phenol) but a consistent influence. Quite fresh: reminds me of a walk around a traditional distillery with notes of steeping barley kiln smoke and youthful spirit. A subtle intriguing thread of gin botanicals (especially citrus peel) weaves its way through the palate. Otherwise the smoke and fruit keep your attention."
5668,9,"Bright gold color. Sweet pear caramel apples vanilla and fudge on the nose. Light to medium in body. On the palate there is more fruit (pear citrus) and sweet malt (vanilla caramel and toffee) with a gently sweet finish.
   Style: Highland (Isle of Arran) single malt Scotch whisky. Price: high $30s. Available nationwide. 
   Again there is no age statement and this one is still on the youthful side but it is richer (some sherry cask aging in the mix?) and expresses more flavors-and deeper flavors-than the one mentioned above. It is still quite young but it tastes more mature than its age (which is probably six years at the most). There's not much Island character here."
5669,1,"Touches of acetone and magic marker/solvent suggest that there’s precious little cask involvement going on here. Pleasing enough with lime jelly and kiwi fruits and a little whiff of sweet oak but it’s very understated. In the mouth it performs in a nutty way but doesn’t seem to have moved much over its quarter of a century sequestration. There is some horchata and brazil nut even a mashy note but it either needs more time or a kick to get it moving. £70"
5670,9,"Obviously aged in a sherry cask. Juicy fruit syrupy a bit waxy notes of maple syrup and spice (clove mint). Nicely soothing but there is a trade-off here-the soft floral beauty which makes Linkwood malt so attractive is lost somewhere behind the sherry and escapes only briefly from time to time. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot.)"
5671,1,"Light onionskin color; the nose is scented with red fruits cranberry sauce hawthorn jelly and red apple. With water there’s some bletted medlars mixed with lemon. Sadly the palate is soapy to start with before the super-ripe red fruits come through. Water makes things fresher but overall it lacks personality."
5672,1,"Hailing from the Speyside distillery this has a deep orange color and an aroma of damp hay and a slightly vegetal note alongside caramel and peanut brittle. A perception of bitterness beside dried peels. The palate is thick with stewing fruits tinned prune and burnt sugar with a background note of wet draff. Water lifts things a little but it's all rather sick and flabby. £150"
5673,9,"I have tasted many superb Longrow whiskies in the past 15 years (not to mention some wonderful Tokaji dessert wines). This isn’t one of them. Longrow is an assertive whisky and I can see the logic of finishing the whisky in an equally big Hungarian wine. The flavors are equal in intensity -- and this is certainly a dynamic whisky -- but they just don’t integrate well. You’ll find notes of waxed fruit raisin ripe barley smoked fig and toffee. Cloying waxy finish."
5674,9,"A sherry cask-matured Bowmore. Introduced as ""the brother"" to the 1989 vintage Bowmore released about a year ago (aged in bourbon casks). Notes of waxed fruit dates fruitcake and raisin permeate through tarry rope leather boots wet socks and ripe peat. Underlying notes of demerara rum chocolate-covered coffee beans and sea salt. A hedonistic Bowmore with an earthy rustic demeanor. (1800 bottles for the U.S.)"
5675,9,"The owners of Bunnahabhain are making a peated version of this normally unpeated Islay whisky to put in their peated blend Black Bottle. But they have not yet put out as a regular item a peated expression of Bunnahabhain for purchase. However some of the independent bottlers got their hands on some and this might be the first one to be offered in the U.S. It’s what you would expect a 9 year old peated Bunnahabhain to taste like: toffee vanilla fudge and nuts (the Bunny signature) kiln peat smoke and a bit too much youthfulness. It needs a few more years to mature to acceptable levels. (Bottled for Binny’s Beverage Depot)"
5676,9,"This whisky comes from two bourbon casks producing only 112 bottles. I believe it’s the most expensive Lowland whisky on the market. Unfortunately its flavor doesn’t stand up to its price. While I applaud Morrison Bowmore's efforts to give us the opportunity to try such a mature expression of Auchentoshan I feel that the whisky is past its prime. I wouldn't describe it as overly woody like I have other whiskies that are 41 years old. Rather I would describe it as overly funky. The whisky's aroma and flavor are very peculiar with plenty of vegetal notes (cucumbers especially) combined with stewed fruit golden raisins rose petals and spice (anise clove). If it were $100 a bottle I would suggest that you gather a few friends to chip in and buy a bottle just for the experience. But at $2000 I think we should leave this one for the collectors."
5677,9,"Nice to see Arran making it to 12 years old. Creamy on the palate and soothing in nature with layers of sweetness (maple and butterscotch syrup vanilla cream) and fruit (caramel apple fried banana). Soft congenial finish. A low-level yet persistent nutty/burnt rubber note detracts from what would otherwise be a very fun pleasantly sweet whisky. (Note: at the time of publication the whisky was not yet available in the U.S. Price above is UK price converted to dollars)."
5678,9,"A very peculiar whisky. It’s interesting in some respects with the thick sweet Hungarian dessert wine fighting with damp peat smoke for attention. But it tastes a little disjointed and a bit too youthful. With a few more years aging (before finishing in the Tokaji wine) the flavors should integrate and mature better. But as it is this whisky is still “work in progress.”"
5679,1,"The lightness of the hue suggests a very slow maturation in refill casks and while I tried hard to get to grips with this I found the nose simply too discreet. There’s a hint of the burning bonfire which indicates the subtle smoke that underpins Cragganmore; there’s even some parma violet dried berries and a hint of sulfur.
The palate picks things up a little showing ferns wet moss Oolong tea and dried apple as well as citrus and — surprisingly — some just-lit cigar fuminess. It’s all rather understated however. This is one of my top distilleries but compared to the recent Special Releases and magnificent Friends of the Classic Malts bottlings this is slightly underwhelming."
5680,1,"The second of the duo — destined for the U.S. and Taiwan — is a relative youngster and has been extracted from a fresh Spanish oak sherry hogshead. The combination of first-fill and smaller cask size is immediately apparent. The color is mocha dark and the nose has a distinctly sulfurous twist behind which are black cherries dipped in chocolate tonka bean and leather. For me there’s too much cask and not sufficient Rothes complexities especially on the palate."
5681,6,"Since a change of ownership in 2014 the Loch Lomond range has been revamped with the previous blue and black label single malt variants being dropped in favor of this repackaged NAS expression. Farmyard aromas on the early nose then emerging malt and caramel. Discreet oak. Rounded on the palate with immediate citrus fruits toffee allspice and a suggestion of smoke. Spices persist through a slightly citric cerealy medium-length finish."
5682,1,"Since Diageo has included Knockando in its Special Release program it seemed only right to reacquaint myself with the standard bottling. This is Speyside in its maltiest guise. The nose is reminiscent of breakfast cereal: Weetabix and bran flakes with a whisper of vanilla. The palate is light and dusty and you get the impression that the malt just wants to scuttle across the tongue and down the throat as quickly as possible. A shy wee mouse of a dram. £30"
5683,9,"Citrus peel light maple syrup and almonds with emerging grape and vanilla. Somewhat elegant in nature but the flavors do not especially complement each other. (Exclusive to Binny’s Beverage Depot.)"
5684,1,"What a contrast with the standard bottling. Here we have Knockando in a hugely active cask and sadly its fragile character collapses under the assault. The nose is oily and sulphury with notes of sealing wax Turkish tobacco and maraschino. The palate is dry and tannic the opposite of what is needed for a whisky that is nutty and dusty in the first place."
5685,9,"This Robert Burns World Federation Arran Single Island Malt is the Calvados or Poire Williams of the whisky world. There's no age statement on this whisky but it has the classic aromas and flavors of sweet pears prominent in very young distilled spirits. The vanilla notes along with its pale color suggest a used bourbon cask. I suppose one could treat it as an aperitif and possibly chill it down or serve it on the rocks."
5686,9,"Deep thick nose with sappy oak dried citrus old leather spearmint and background leafy smoke. Nicely viscous on the palate with similar notes as the aroma. But mid-palate the age gets the best of this whisky. The flavors flatten out and the wood dominates through the finish as the leather notes linger. It’s a rare treat to taste a whisky this old. If you like Lalique (and have the money) then this new bottling is worth some consideration because there are certainly moments of intrigue and pleasure on the nose and beginning of the palate. But I have tasted several other 50-plus year old Macallans and I can say with certainty that the 50 year old Millennium bottling and the 1946 vintage release were better and can probably still be found for a significantly lower price (Only 420 bottles available worldwide.)"
5687,9,"Port Ellen is going to just keep getting rarer and more expensive and the quality is going to get more variable. This one shows the traditional Port Ellen characteristics (seaweed tar charcoal damp earth vanilla salt white pepper) but it just seems to flatten out mid-palate leading to a fairly lifeless slightly astringent finish. I feel like some of the guts were ripped out of this whisky. Bottling at a higher strength (and not chill-filtered) would have helped immensely."
5688,9,"This Lowland distillery only operated from 1957-1975. Huge bourbon impact on the nose and palate along with vanilla coconut stewed fruit and dried wood spice -- especially on the finish with lingering notes of anise espresso very dark chocolate and charcoal. A taste of history for sure but this is a whisky that never was meant to be aged this long."
5689,9,"Youthful and somewhat brooding for a Tomintoul. I can tell there’s some young whisky in here as there’s a suggestion of new make spirit interwoven with notes of heather ripe barley raw peat and lingering smoke. I like the concept but wish the young component (the peated part of this whisky?) was matured a bit longer."
5690,9,"Origins is Benromach’s new program to highlight different aspects of whisky-making which I think is a great idea. This expression focuses on the use of Golden Promise barley to make the malt which is then aged in a sherry cask. Unfortunately there’s so much sherry here that I struggle to appreciate the impact or distinction from the Golden Promise barley. Notes of ripe orchard fruit tangerine beeswax sticky toffee pudding and toasted almond. Lingering smoke and waxed fruit stays through to the finish. A weighty Benromach (from the Golden Promise and/or the sherry). I find the nose pleasant enough but the sherry-induced waxed fruit component that emerges mid-palate is just too dominant."
5691,9,"Quite pale in color. Very youthful and naked with damp peat leafy smoke charred oak and black licorice pears in honey and vanilla-tinged barley. Quite an eye-opener for a non-Islay whisky. It’s a little green and ornery. Certainly an entertaining whisky but a few more years in the barrel would round this whisky out meld the flavors together and add depth."
5692,9,"Aged in a sherry cask which adds sweet notes of toffee Caribbean rum waxed fruit red licorice and fruitcake to go along with the earthy smoke and lingering peat. A much sweeter fruitier affair than the Croftengea also reviewed here but behind all that sherry there’s still a whisky that needs a little more maturing."
5693,9,"Earthy fleshy notes with brooding grape notes and a gamey finish -- the Nebbiolo grape influence is obvious. I enjoy Barolo wine and I enjoy Edradour whisky but the flavors in this whisky mix like oil and water. (Exclusive to Binny’s Beverage Depot.)"
5694,9,"The sherry is very dominant and cloying which is unfortunate. And I’m not crazy about the quality of the sherry (or perhaps even the wood it was aged in). I have great respect for both Highland Park and Binny’s but this is somewhat disappointing for a Highland Park. Tasted twice with the same opinion. (Bottled for Binny’s Beverage Depot)"
5695,9,"Fiery peat kiln smoke tar and ripe barley on the nose. Not overly complex but not a problem either. On the palate the whisky starts out acceptable enough. But by mid-palate the whisky turns harsh and unpleasant with petroleum and vegetal notes that continues through to the finish. (Exclusive to Astor Wines and Spirits.)"
5696,10,"The final installment in this impressive series gets to the heart of Quercus mongolica using slow-grown Asian oak sourced from northeastern China which is much less porous than Japanese mizunara. Aromas of Cox’s orange pippin rhubarb caramel malt pecan pie peppercorn clove and appealing sandalwood notes. Deliciously malty with sweet sponge cake citrus oils dried apple soft caramel nuts and clove with a mouth-coating finish of vanilla caramel. Totally moreish. (6228 bottles) (€80)"
5697,10,"This punchy U.S. debut is a smokier affair than their recent output with aromas of campfire embers cigar smoke vanilla custard bread-and-butter pudding and cooked red gooseberry; this is calming aromatic smoke associated with good times. Sipping reveals flavors of fresh raspberry cinnamon nutmeg and chocolate before a wave of smoke and caramel toffee. The tandem partnership of smoke and sherry is phenomenally good."
5698,10,"Burning cedar chocolate-flavored tobacco notes and sooty ash pierce through this powerful whisky’s smoky aromas just as latitude 63 strikes through the High Coast warehouse. Experiment with dilution to your heart’s content: tangy citrus rolling spices and smoke are smashed by a meteoric impact of high alcohol that abates slowly revealing dark fruits toffee wood tannins cocoa and cappuccino notes. If Cohiba cigars made a whisky this would be it."
5699,10,"Creamy vanilla frosting lemon curd white pepper sugar lumps delicate floral scents and aromas of butter-soft leather. Light creamy mouthfeel with vanilla marshmallow honey and Scottish tablet developing hints of marmalade and fruit Life Savers before a long sweet vanilla-led finish. Named for the Swedish word for river this is utterly delicious and makes an elegant impression."
5700,10,"A Swedish sherry bomb exploding with plum candied peel raisins prune juice and star anise; heavier on rich sherry and dark fruit than nutty fruitcake aromas. Effortless drinking with flavors of raspberry red currant and cherry. These beautifully integrated sherry flavors are complemented by light toffee raisins ginger and pepper with a spiced-fruit finish."
5701,10,"Wood spice with a little peat smoke vanilla cream dried apricot golden sultana apple rings and orange peel make for a tantalizing combination of scents. Named after the Swedish word for sea the palate is awash with a concentration of sweet fruit pepper clove and wood spices yielding to dried mango papaya light honey apricot and peach until a second wave of spiciness washes over everything."
5702,10,"For those interested in transparency the detail Box releases about each bottling is staggering; e.g. 5% of this whisky was matured in medium-toasted Hungarian virgin oak. This one is for Islay fans showing more peat than smoke; nutty and replete with barley notes. Approachable at cask strength: melon bright citrus tropical fruits burnt orange and plenty of pepper. We hear the first U.S. release from Box is imminent. (8291 bottles) 743 SEK"
5703,10,"Handpicked from over 100 casks this is a belter! Puréed prune dunnage black licorice clove coffee bean and raisin-studded chocolate. It’s like scorched earth after a wildfire. There is a syrupy dark rum-like sweetness a medley of cinnamon cocoa raisin and vanilla essence. Water flushes out some gentle smoke and adds smoothness but by god it’s wonderful neat. The best yet from Spirit of Hven. (294 bottles) 975 SEK"
5704,10,"Marmalade vanilla brittle toffee cream dried red fruits red currant dates and wafts of floral scents flecked with ground pepper and a little chile heat. The sherry wood flavors are polished delicious and really deliver: honey marmalade baked orange and candied peel it rides a crest of active spices then runny caramel canned peaches and raisin leaving the gums tingling with residual spices."
5705,4,"Mackmyra has made its name on the back of salty often peaty whiskies but this is a revelation. It's a spring whisky with much in common with Bladnoch in the Scottish Lowlands or peated Connemara from Ireland: sweet apple and pear flavors flit over wispy drying smoke. Sweden is represented by juniper but there is blackcurrant while cinnamon plays a role too. Subtle sweet and sexy. £110"
5706,10,"This seasonal whisky’s name translates to “happy hunting” and evokes the Swedish love of foraging for berries in the forest. The complex recipe involves a component whisky filled into a variety of casks seasoned with Grythyttan Vin’s lingonberry and blueberry wine. Fragrant nose with soft white fruits grasses and root ginger with flavors of blueberry honey dried peel and a fireworks extravaganza of spices before a cashew and hazelnut finish. SEK599"
5707,10,"Angela D’Orazio selected both birch sap wine and PX sherry casks combined with a few punchy 30-liter casks for this beauty. An incredibly rich intense and complex nose; a medley of cooked fruits cherry cake mix marzipan tree blossoms stem ginger herbs cigar box beech nuts and scorched coconut. Unctuous and syrupy the palate is immersed in vanilla extract dry fruits cocoa and inky black coffee. A lengthy finish of oak dark vanilla and toasted coconut. Result? A whisky colossus. €140"
5708,10,"Disgorge bourbon quarter-casks after 3 years and fill them into sixteen virgin American oak 40-liter casks that have been made from air-seasoned wood medium toasted then charred and what do you get? Maple syrup pecan pie nuttiness piercing vanilla fluffy cotton candy and the char note of the dome of a well-fired fruitcake. The palate chews through nut brittle butterscotch praline nutmeg baked banana and active wood spices with the sweetness of a good bourbon. Respect. (700 bottles) 889 SEK"
5709,10,"After several years off the market this welcome return from Mackmyra was composed from a mixture of cask types including Swedish oak and matured underground in the Bodås mine. Floral notes honey citrus vanilla and pears poached in cream with balancing tartness from gooseberry and grapefruit. A delicious summer whisky with sweet lemon biscuits clementine apricot vanilla fudge and active spices which mellow to expose banana honeydew melon and a finish of bitter lemon and mixed peel. (4800 bottles)"
5710,10,"Resounding bourbon-cask flavors throughout with a nose of buttercream icing sugar honeydew desiccated coconut sanded oak and peppercorn; the spices become more pronounced the longer the glass sits. Flavors of lemon peel vanilla apple and black pepper—the sweet vanilla and fruit burst through a veil of spices—settling down to almond-studded nougat and finishing with bitter lemon at the swallow."
5711,10,"The first core bottling from Box is named after the Sami people’s word for winter. It’s around 5 years old and matured in bourbon casks with 24% of the composition using malt kilned to 39 parts per million. Smoky peats and smoked ham in harmony with blossom honey lemon zest and pistachio shells. Vibrant orange and lemon notes settle to creamy toffee and Edinburgh rock the last drops of citrus squeezing out in the finish. 479 SEK"
5712,4,"Mackmyra continues to play a far more sophisticated game than it is given credit for releasing pleasant and easy drinking mainstream malts and then packing a punch with one-off oddball single casks. So this is an utter delight and among the very best Mackmyras released. Vanilla banana sweet jellybeans and some toffee all playing Mr. Hyde. Dr. Jekyll pops up with earthy salt notes. Medical gauze and pepper for a savory finale."
5713,9,"The first ""big"" release from this Swedish distillery.  I'm very impressed.  It's youthful but not immature.  Very intriguing too.  Bright notes of ripe orchard fruit and soothing vanilla cream on the nose and palate along with more subtle bramble silky honey and caramel toasted coconut marshmallow bread dough and grist.  Teasing smoke emerges occasionally adding to this whisky's delightful nature.  Clean toasted oak finish.  I particularly enjoy the complex interplay between the fruit and sweetness.  A fun whisky with a playful personality.  More please!"
5714,10,"Expect six 2nd step bottlings each showcasing different personalities of Box single malt; peating wood and cask size will be tweaked in pursuit of world-class quality. The twin pleasures of fruity sherry and smoke wrinkle the nostrils delightfully. An admirable balance: prudent use of peat countered by apple chocolate Kendal mint cake nougat and a fresh minerality. Resplendent in noble oloroso; think apple flapjacks sultana fig maple syrup and toffee banana with a prickle of spice lasting into the finish. (5000 bottles) SEK747"
5715,10,"Peppery spice rubs light vanilla and whipped cream meet a stealthy growth of grassy peat smoke leading to aromas of rock pool salinity and breezy ozone. An arsonist in a candy store: lemon bonbon vanilla and chalky candies with a building spiciness of clove and pepper bursting with a firework of smoky flavors which clear aside for the return of sugary-sweet lemon and caramels."
5716,4,"This is the thirteenth release in this series and we've reviewed about five of them; they have been very hit and miss but the general trend has definitely been upward. These are casks selected by Angela D'Orazio and they show what a diverse distillery Mackmyra has become. This is a dessert and cigar whisky with melon banana and vanilla at one end and chili spice and earthy smoky malt at the other. Excellent. £110"
5717,10,"This rufescent whisky evokes aromas of cherry blossom kirsch white pepper and wood spices. Light cherry syrup caramel and toffee with a strident eruption of black pepper and clove that sets the underside of your tongue alight. Körsbär is Swedish for cherry and the fat red berry flavors leave a lovely warm glow inside. Despite its color the sweet cherry wine finish has been judged to perfection. (SEK1198; Not available in the U.S.)"
5718,4,"Mackmyra has at long last reached the United States. It has been a growing force for some years and is now a stocky adolescent with a personality all its own. What was challenging salty peat is now in check and the fruity delights are to the fore with canned sweet pear vanilla cherry blossom and lacquer on the nose. There’s a flip-flop on the palate from melon and vanilla to dusty peppery peat in the finish."
5719,4,"This is the whisky equivalent of Metallica playing country songs. You can feel the power of the malt you know it can kick out hard if it wants to. But it's all wrapped up in Kentucky finery the sweet bourbon candy and vanilla notes offsetting the salt and pepper and some mint leaf and berry fruits to send it on its way. It's not an entirely comfortable pairing but by far the best of this bunch. SEK 1195"
5720,4,"It’s well possible that this will be the last of the Special range and if so then it is both a bit of a whisper of an ending and a highly pleasant one. This is as easygoing and gentle as Mackmyra ever gets. Very much a sweet and savory delight this is a soft dessert whisky with banana and cream in evidence. That’s before someone pours the salt pot over it. Even then the caramel and fruit battle back. Highly enjoyable."
5721,10,"Although around 3 years old the maturity has been achieved by using smaller 40-liter bourbon casks (65% unpeated/15% peated whisky) with the remainder coming from peated whisky matured in Swedish oak. This adds a depth of character to the nose the peat meeting honeydew melon vanilla caramelized bananas grist malty notes and crushed hazelnuts. Sweet toffee apple citrus flapjacks crackling spices and barley grains play over a swelling creamy smokiness. Simply stunning considering its age. 837 SEK"
5737,10,"In the Straits of Øresund between Denmark and Sweden sits the beautiful island of Hven. This is the first in a series of seven whiskies to mark the brightest stars of the Big Dipper asterism. Candied peel walnut shells warm marmalade vanilla pods and haylofts intermingle before Red Delicious apples shoulder in. It’s a lively youthful dram of baked orange milk chocolate and vanilla tablet with a touch of pear. Best neat as water subtracts from the experience. €90"
5722,10,"Solsken comprises a parcel of smaller sherry and Swedish oak casks hand-picked by master blender Angela D’Orazio. The nose is like a basket of hot breakfast pastries with honeycomb tinned peaches cinnamon and hot teacakes with singed edges smoking from the grill. An amazing golden taste that’s warm and soothing; sucked lozenges mandarin segments tame spices and cobnut. The strength of the alcohol remains veiled in the shadows until the swallow…then it pounces. Mouth puckering finish of sharp fruit juices. €130"
5723,10,"Angela D’Orazio matured a third of the component whiskies in cherry-wine casks for this seasonal creation. Rather than cherries the fruity aroma of the wine is more apparent on the nose together with crushed root ginger hawthorn drying tobacco leaf and beefsteak tomatoes. This thick-textured dram exudes cherry strawberry and vanilla fudge drawing the mouth before a late phase of rum and raisin aniseed peppermint and menthol. 598 SEK"
5724,10,"Named after a supernova not the Seven Stars this uses a mashbill of pale ale chocolate and heavily-peated malt with three specific cask specifications. Toffee apple cotton candy gentle leaf smoke dry seasoned logs cacao vanilla seeds and ripe bananas. A lighter mouthfeel with juicy sweetness mixed peel cinnamon dry banana chips mild ginger chocolate notes and cocoa. The finish feels short then out of left field it hits you with a surging wave of chocolate and coffee."
5725,10,"One part whisky from 40-liter sherry casks using peated and unpeated batches to three parts peated whisky aged in regular bourbon casks. Damp peat smoke mint toffees and a savory note on the nose with a distinct mintiness continuing on the palate. A hot smoky core is chaperoned with flavors of dry banana vanilla essence and white plums developing a late creamy texture and a fresh minty finish. Surely this will be approved by dentists everywhere? 837 SEK"
5726,10,"This wintery limited edition was finished in casks that previously held Bordeaux Glühwein and sherry. This achieves an appealing nose of orchard fruits and spices. Juicy apple hints of conference pear cinnamon clove vanilla tablet and lemon pith. Apple is at the core of the flavor but it’s rich with warming spices strawberry and zabaglione tightening in the end to a conclusion of dried fruits nut shells and a twist of pepper. (Sweden France and Germany only) €65"
5727,10,"Meaning Swedish smoke and they’ve nailed the juniper smoke perfectly here. Ripening lemons fresh cream Turkish delight pine forests and barley sugar aromas. Great poise and balance. A light lacey structure comprising creamy fudge honey lemon oak and vanilla. It just dances on the tongue. Yet billowing puffs of smoke pulse from the center. Baked lemon peel ushers in a pleasurable rolling smoky finish. This Röks! €59"
5728,4,"This is the second release from this tiny independent Swedish distillery and it takes a confident step forward from the first though it's not the finished article yet. The youthfulness is there but there's much to admire too: citrus notes mainly lemon some melon tropical fruit (mango perhaps?) and some soft orange fruits make for a gentle almost blend-like whisky. Late saltiness and a touch of pepper ensure it's not cloying and distinctively Swedish. Very encouraging."
5729,10,"Be more Swedish: escape the city and head to a rural red-painted summer house with a tasty bottle of this little beauty tucked under your arm. A clean fresh nose of marshmallows Scottish tablet warm spices and reed matting. A thick substantial palate with an array of lighter flavors; sweet barley sugar honey melon vanilla frosting gentle citrus and spicy cinnamon. Great balance of power and delicacy here. The cinnamon rolls into a finish that really goes the distance. €65"
5730,10,"Pär Caldenby makes this 45 ppm peated island whisky off Sweden’s west coast maturing it in 110L capacity virgin European oak and Bordeaux casks. Lemon bonbon vanilla pod crisped bacon rind and burnt toast crumbs are backed with a blackberry note. The longer I nose the more the peat edges over the sweetness. Syrupy with an intense alcohol flare: apple lemon and vanilla sponge but dilutes to ground ginger citrus and herbal notes. The smoke is unobtrusive. Young promising and gutsy. SEK 1276"
5731,10,"Mackmyra has used 30-liter casks held underground in the Bodås mine the archipelago repository on Fjäderholmarna and the forest repository in the Whisky Village in Gävle. Bruised banana ground almond Horlicks spearmint and budding foliage characterize the nose. The fruity whirlpool of flavor includes apple watermelon and poached pears a second wave of dried fruits and fudge all anchored by a clean edge of Kendal mint cake. Bubblegum on dilution. A final rush of coffee/cocoa before a sweet juicy finish. €130"
5732,10,"Two-thirds malt smoked with Scottish peat the remaining third is unpeated Viking malt all filled into first-fill bourbon quarter casks achieving 30ppm. Peat smoke lobster pots pine forests smoked fish and some zesty lemons. A beautiful dense texture of candied peel and sweet lemons; smoke flaring briefly before dying back to a honeyed conclusion. Water picks out an almond and nougat note with lemon sherbet. If you are new to Box this is a fantastic place to begin. (2000 bottles) €124"
5733,4,"Early bottlings of Mackmyra were a challenge — salty peat intense woodiness and unusual juniper-influenced spices made the whisky an acquired taste. Over time though sweet fruit brought more balance and the whiskies have bloomed. This special bottling — one of four in the Moments series — recalls those roots but delivers a meaty spicy and earthy flavor with melt in the mouth syrup. Imagine honey poured on a heavily peppered well-done steak. €141 (Currently not available in the U.S.)"
5734,10,"Henric Moulin is a passionate ‘grain to glass’ whisky maker who established Sweden’s third pot still distillery in 2008. This 25-cask batch puts up a nose of cantaloupe green grapes fruit syrups Black Jack candy kid leather and a whiff of peat smoke. Soft in the mouth it’s peppery with herbal notes slabs of vanilla fudge and a little milk chocolate. Water adds a dash of creaminess but it’s preferable neat. The wax-dipped bottles will appeal to Maker’s fans. €90"
5735,10,"Willingly we travel further along the Big Dipper with whisky maker Henric Molin. His latest creation exudes rich dark chewy toffee Brazil nut shells chopped dates licorice stone fruits grilled beef mushrooms and worked leather. The flavor starts slowly like trying to ignite a fire of damp twigs. Once established there is good weight and density with treacle dried fig black cherry and cinnamon but the finish diminishes quickly after swallowing leaving blackened oak and burnt sugar. 795 SEK"
5736,4,"The Mackmyra success story just goes on and on. There have now been more Specials than bottlings of Privus or Preludium and the whisky makers seem to have hit upon a trademark taste that they tweak with each bottling. It's a mix of salt pepper citrus and vanilla and here the vanilla is at its most subdued and the salt is at its highest. That makes this challenging to anyone unfamiliar with the Mackmyra brand. SEK 649"
5738,10,"Named after the 10% of the recipe that benefits from Swedish oak maturation this light-colored dram has honey-drenched crumpets creamed butter green tea taken in lemon groves and hints of peppermint. Shredded lemon and lime peels are joined by a precise concentrated wood spice note with ground ginger and black pepper. Dilution fattens the mouthfeel but flattens the citrus peel leaving a smudge of light toffee and malt. Pleasant sipping for those long Swedish summer days. €59"
5739,4,"This may well be the perfect entry level Mackmyra. It has a lower strength and is almost Mackmyra Lite thinner and less peaky peppery and peaty than every other Mackmyra bottling. There’s a green fruit almost gooseberry dimension to this; most unusual for the distillery and the peaty underlay is fractured and dusty rather than sharp and intense. A revelation and proof that the distillery is branching out."
5740,10,"Again this uses malt peated to 45 ppm which is evident by the nose of salty beach bonfires though there is an intense honeyed sweetness to enjoy: golden syrup bars toasted English muffins stroopwafel and a cool line of spearmint. Although the alcohol roars loudly there is honey and banana some Tabasco heat and flashes of orange. Water adds creaminess to the nose but the structure doesn’t respond so well. Tough it out at full strength. (295 bottles) SEK 953"
5741,4,"There are now fourteen distilleries in Sweden. This is the second one after Mackmyra to start bottling whisky and it's rather good. It's clearly young but there are big flavors here including blackcurrant and rich citrus fruits early on then a Highland-style earthiness toward the end with distinctive peat lasting longest into the finish. There is a lot to like here and with age the line between fruit and peat will become more blurred. 1295 SEK"
5742,10,"Initial maturation in sherry and bourbon wood from the U.S. and Sweden finished in fermented birch sap wine casks. Concentrated heather honey wax fresh mascarpone fruit tarts and toasted oak. It draws the mouth in: fruity but not sweet. Stewed dark fruits from the hedgerow and orchard (cherry apple plum mulberry and rhubarb) then a delayed splurge of spices and pepper ending with Brazil nut espresso and bitter cacao. It’s all rather austere serious and forbidding. €65"
5743,4,"This is the Mackmyra equivalent of an arena rock band playing a small town club gig; a raw rough and ready in your face rock and roll version of the whisky — and it’s not for the faint-hearted. Matured in French red wine casks it has a pleasant apricot and woodsmoke nose while the taste is young brittle and gristy with intense and persistent pepper ginger and bitter berries. Well-made but not the best starting point to explore Mackmyra."
5744,4,"Moment is a series of special one-off single malt whisky releases and allows the distillery to experiment with cask types. Some of the whiskies such as this one take the distillery back to an earlier more intense and difficult era. So here we have mushroomy earthy whisky with damp autumn leaves artichoke tobacco and salted fish in the mix. It's a full-on savory experience and not one for the faint-hearted. SEK 1295"
5745,4,"Mackmyra makes no secret of the fact that it borrowed the idea for this release from its American friends. The name means 'white dog' but the taste is all Scotland. It's sappy fresh raw and vegetal with some pleasing menthol notes. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of it is how much like scotch new make it tastes suggesting that Swedish barrels have a very big say in the final product. SEK 319"
5746,10,"This is a highly fragrant young whisky with aromas of peeled satsumas zested lime rosebuds graham cracker sponge cake and a trace of aromatic spice. Light to medium-bodied with sweet orange honey marmalade walnut and malt then a slow crescendo of cocoa spice and cereal notes to a finish of grated chocolate. (1200 bottles)"
5747,1,"South Africa may be home to an increasingly impressive wine industry — and a noted brandy producer — but the country is also home to two whisky distilleries. Drayman’s in Pretoria is run by brewer Moritz Kallmeyer while the James Sedgwick distillery in Wellington is home to Three Ships and Bain’s Cape Mountain Grain. Bain’s was created by distiller Andy Watts as a way to attract the new female drinker. Sweet and succulent this is like an alcohol ice cream sundae — fudge chunks toffee and butterscotch syrup not to mention the ice cream You pile on the pounds just smelling it. A lush beauty."
5748,4,"South Africa’s most established distillery now makes Scotch-style single malt whisky that the country can be proud of. The downside is that it plays it safe and the flavors on offer are subdued and subtle. That said though there’s plenty to like here — delicate floral notes including rose with a rich and honeyed heart traces of exotic fruits including kumquat and kiwi wispy smoke and some cinnamon and paprika. Solid. €47.50 (Not available in the U.S.)"
5749,4,"The man behind this whisky is an acclaimed craft brewer and on the strength of his early efforts this intriguing distillery is going to be winning plaudits from the world of whisky before too long. This single cask bottling steps over the hurdle of youthful sappy barley at its core thanks to a big dose of wine-influenced spirit which is liqueur-like; rich full and heavily berried. The killer though is the way the whisky goes up through the spice gears. €48 (Not available in the U.S.)"
5750,4,"The distillery makes big claims for this whisky stressing that it shares the same high production values as Scotland and the importance of altitude in the Highveld to maturation. This is the first whisky release from a Pretoria brewery and it is fascinating. The nose is confused but the palate is liqueur-like with blackcurrant cordial and Vimto [a UK fruit-herb soda]. Its problem is its youth. It’s not yet fully integrated and there are immature rootsy notes here but it’s promising. €36 Currently not available in the U.S."
5751,10,"Although distilled in Scotland this completed its maturation in Spain; it’s not scotch but it is very tasty. Cocoa powder melted milk chocolate ground hazelnut vanilla pod snuff and allspice go full tilt at cask strength. Chocolate fondant pudding baked fruit cocoa malt dried fig black pepper and black fruits operate with a dark tangy edge that ignites the tongue. This has been bottled at a perfect strength. (900 bottles for U.S.)"
5752,10,"A sultry earthy fragrant whisky with black cherry currants dunnage warehouses sherry ground ginger dry oak and chili flakes. Warm and enticing this displays great structure: black cherry sultana and dried fig; a middle phase of cavorting spices that are soothed into a lengthy finish of spicy rich dried fruits. Plenty of sherry character makes this a delicious find but it would be interesting to try a less cask-driven expression. (900 bottles for U.S.)"
5753,10,"Red apple dried fig clove baked ham and plums boiled in sugar in this warm fragrant and aromatic whisky made with Spanish malt. The complexity of the nose is not sustained as the spice characters dominate the palate after the initial few seconds. Baked orange verging on tropical fruits is overthrown by the black pepper and clove welling up from the underside of the tongue leaving a bitter chicory aftertaste. (900 bottles for U.S.)"
5754,10,"A dull stewed-fruit note with polished apples pink blancmange rose hip and a dash of spice but not a very demonstrative whisky. The body is light and flimsy even for a 3 year old blend and the palate offers the return of that sweet pink blancmange light caramel and the sweetness of candy cigarettes. It crosses the line with late sugary sweetness and a short peppery finish. Life’s all about choices."
5755,4,"This is a Spanish whisky from the Granada region. It's not Spain's first whisky or its best but this could eventually be a contender. Its problem is that it has sulfur all over it: a deliberate attempt to empower the malt or sloppy whisky making? Get past it though and this is a thin light orange and mandarin aperitif whisky and ideal to serve chilled early on a sunny summer Spanish evening. It's about context. Not earth-shattering though. €80"
5756,4,"Made entirely with Spanish barley and showing healthy progress this 10 year old single malt is further proof that owner Beam Global is committed to producing quality Spanish single malt. But it has some way to go. This is a señorita not a matador and is far too polite — more like a blend than a single malt. Orange jelly marzipan and apple pip all make an appearance but it’s all too safe."
5757,7,"A non-age statement Spanish malt whisky. Whereas Scotch whisky is often a showcase of the grain this Spanish malt is all about spotlighting the unique Palo Cortado sherry cask. Monster raisin leads things off and is followed by apricot jam honey ginger and grape blossom. The impact of sherry is so great it borders on tasting like an interesting young Spanish brandy. A very spicy mid-palate which is a little hot drives a very dry finish. (U.S. only)"
5758,7,"No age statement on this grain whisky made from Spanish corn and aged in Palo Cortado sherry casks. Whereas the Navazos-Palazzi malt captured the richness of the sherry the grain seems to pull the more acidic and dry qualities. Here it's dry sherry coffee bean brown sugar and white pepper. Much hotter and drier than the Navazos-Palazzi malt it explodes with heat and spice. This grain whisky was probably never meant to be consumed unblended and it shows. (U.S. only)"
5759,10,"Inside an ice palace located 11332 feet up the Jungfraujoch this American oak oloroso butt matured gracefully at a chilly but constant 25°F. A rich vista of currants red Anjou pears pecan brittle musty spices and saline with a rootsy earthy vibe. Flavors climb through intense vanilla fleeting balsamic notes a ridge of succulent cherry sherry and sultana. Orange and grapefruit at the summit. Drawn-out spice and oak finish then clove and peppermint. A pinnacle of Swiss whisky making. (981 bottles) CHF179"
5760,4,"Two years ago I included this at a London whisky and music festival for 1000 cool and trendy young music fans. This was the star of the show. When it says “peated” it means sooty charcoal-like church incense with smoked meats and salami. It's intense unforgettable and not unlike a big smoky Swiss cheese. Up there with Balcones and Corsair IMHO (that’s “In My Humble Opinion.” I'm down with the kids you see). €55"
5761,4,"Whisky Advocate is moving out into the unknown turning over the rocks and discovering beautiful and unfamiliar creatures like this one. In tiny distilleries in Switzerland Sweden and er Swansea they're throwing the rule book up in the air and creating new whiskies based on how it falls. This has spent four years in a beer barrel and then a year in a port cask and it's fabulous. Think licorice aniseed and cherry-flavored soda. Then add cream fruit…and yowza! €35"
5762,4,"This is whisky made in a European style; don't expect scotch. Reset your taste buds free your mind. This is 6 years old and spent five and a half of them in a beer barrel—the whisky is made from an award winning beer—and six months in a Merlot wine cask. It's fabulous. Honeycomb creamy toffee caramel European sappiness. It's slightly flabby like an overfed but much-loved puppy. €35"
5763,10,"From the Rugen distillery in Interlaken this was filled into American oak oloroso sherry butts and rolled into the Rugen Mountain rock cellars that were built in 1875.  Almond glacé cherry apricot wood spices and nougat create a very active nose. A lightness of touch with vanilla honey strawberry and raspberry make for a juicy mouthfeel despite a swell of black pepper and ginger. It just grows and grows. The fresh fruits seem impervious to the dying spices. CHF119"
5764,10,"Ruedi Käser has made Whisky Castle one of the best-known Swiss whiskies and he actively experiments with different grains and cask types. This single-cask expression was produced from corn and 20% peated malt. Herbal notes fruit jelly on toast dry oak cinnamon warm toasty spices and a little smoke. A nice silky texture; red fruits apple plum ground ginger and peppercorn. Pleasant sweetness to begin then a growing bitterness decaying to a dry and spicy finish. CHF89"
5765,10,"Another creation from Elfingen Switzerland this rich dark chestnut-color dram combines their Smoke Barley with oloroso cask maturation. The nose is a merry mix of sweet peat smoke cushioned by Serrano ham dried fig and fish box reek. Berry fruits and sultana initially though the texture is quite tannic with the stronger alcohol showing through. It develops a bubblegum note with over-boiled fruit and some savory meat juices rounding off a short dry finish. CHF89"
5766,4,"If you're looking for a radically different tasting malt whisky to anything else you know start here. This is all Christmas church incense burnt treacle toffee charcoal and overdone barbecued meat. Weird? Multiply by five and you're getting there. But I took this to a two-day music festival for 25-35 year olds and of the 20 world whiskies on show this was one of the most requested. €62"
5767,4,"Why is it that so many great beer-producing European nations many of them with Germanic roots didn't progress to whisky making? Appenzeller brewery makes this malt using old beer casks and they have softened the edges of the malt and given it a liquid honey frame around which woody-earthy notes and unripe dates create an intriguing mix. A long long way from the Alps to the Scottish Highlands but a lofty malt nevertheless.  €45"
5768,10,"The makers of Unser Bier in the Gundeli district of Basel produce this young whisky and host an annual seminar in November where guests learn about distillation and maturation from the master brewer. The nose has honey and melon but it’s drenched in the sweet wine notes. The palate mingles the melon and honey flavors with sugared sultana until the sweetness abates bringing out more fruit skins then a surprising spearmint note on the finish. CHF79"
5769,4,"The least exciting or distinctive of the Santis range and in some ways the most Germanic and European with a soft sweet and rounded taste that depending on your point of view is either flabby and ill-defined or delightfully soft and cushion-like; the whisky equivalent of eating a milk chocolate bar with a honeycomb center.  €32"
5770,10,"Floor 5 of the Kavalan warehouse is packed with their best sherry casks. The story begins with sultana Brazil nut vanilla pod dates and chocolate macaroons. The palate has ripe fruit cherry date coffee candied orange chocolate mocha fruit pastilles and some pepper ending with bitter coffee notes. Cutting the strength provokes more citrus though it reverts back to mocha eventually. Outstanding whisky and definitely the best of the bunch. (499 bottles)"
5771,4,"This is the pick of the bunch the whisky equivalent of Fountains of Wayne; an effervescent dessert whisky which from the first aroma to the final finish is a consistent mix of vanilla coconut and overripe banana sprinkled with icing sugar and cinnamon."
5772,10,"Beautiful dark amber in color this has a fabulous nose of lush red-berry fruits blueberry red apple blackcurrant Fabbri strawberries peppercorn wet slate dry oak wood spices and smoked meats. The power of the muscular whisky matches the majesty of the wine cask: berry fruit flavors seep from the thick caramel mouthfeel amid an explosion of pepper at high strength but with water added this still has incredible range. NT$8800"
5773,4,"Surprise surprise. This is like the school's best pitcher who then steps onto the football team and throws for a game-winning touchdown. This is a whole new side to Kavalan. Remember Faith No More doing “Easy”? Having out-sherried and out-bourboned us with kickass rock-n-roll whisky Kavalan goes for gentle and croony with vanilla and honey. The coup de grace? Apple pie and cream morph into licorice and menthol. Exquisite."
5774,10,"Rich and intense nose with paradise cake honey dried apple plum and crème d’abricot. The mouthfeel is dry nutty and fruity with a silky consistency. The cask strength is more noticeable here but as it dissipates there is some late complexity of plum skin and coffee bean with wave after effortless wave of flavor lasting for minutes on end. Finish is hot and nutty with moist coffee grains. (499 bottles)"
5775,4,"The Kavalan flag is unfurling fast. The whiskies are making it Stateside and they're improving from a very high base. A couple of degrees stronger than previously this is far richer than any wine cask-matured whisky has a right to be. This is huge with a tropical nose of mango melon and papaya and a hint of dustiness. The palate is astounding. Rich sweet and rounded it coats the mouth with an intense mixture tempered by burnt toffee and cocoa. Stunning."
5776,4,"Kavalan is Taiwanese whisky from the King Car Company and the progress its whiskeys are making is truly remarkable. With humidity roughly the same as Speyside — high — but the temperature more than 20° Fahrenheit  higher maturation is on fast forward. This is just 4 years old but it’s a monster mix of kumquat liqueur tropical fruit blackcurrant and strawberry and cream candy. Later on some eastern spices especially turmeric bring it all back home. Remarkable. €70 Currently not available in the U.S."
5777,10,"Damson jam herbal undertones banana leaf scallions and clean fresh oak notes. Burst of red fruit; raspberry strawberry rosehip and sherry with lips tingling from the PX spices citrus enters the fray then chewy butter toffees. Wonderful complexity and flavor trajectory it rounds off on a strawberry note. It is great to find a heavyweight whisky that is perfectly approachable at cask strength. The finish stays juicy with vibrant spices. (502 bottles)"
5778,9,"Delicately complex. Dried vanilla pineapple toasted coconut tangerine and cream. A kiss of honey and polished oak on the finish. Quite lovely and very versatile; it would make a delicious pre-dinner dram. (Julio’s Liquors and Loch & K(e)y exclusive)"
5779,10,"This has a seductive nose of mango kiwi dried tropical fruits rich oak silky caramels and milk chocolate-covered cranberries. The dynamics of this cask-strength whisky play out handsomely with an opening gambit of warm berry fruits peaking with emphatic spices and ending with a reflective phase of butter toffee mocha and Ovaltine. A dash of water encourages clove-studded orange flavors and preserves the long spicy finish."
5780,10,"This dark walnut-colored dram delivers the fabulous first-fill sherry cask characteristics we love: raisin mixed peel fruitcake marzipan Brazil nut jellied fruits and nutmeg. So wonderfully thick and chewy that you need to resist the temptation to pick up a knife and fork. It imparts dark weighty fruit blackened oak cooked apple and a twister of peppery turmoil. Add water liberally to unlock figs dates and plums."
5781,4,"Each cask of this nicely packaged malt is selected by the distiller and so there is considerable variation between batches. This one is a step up from last year's releases. It's slightly weaker but the nose has firmed up into a delightful mix of fresh juicy grape and a spicy dustiness. Tastewise this takes an amazing journey from plummy sweet fruit up front to a slow dominance of dry sherry at the end. The finish is longer than before. Excellent."
5782,10,"This stirred a primeval urge in me for a good steak: bramble blueberry ripe Victoria
plum Morello cherry exotic spices and a hot and heavy perfumed scent from the
select wine cask maturation. Sweet berry fruit—though mouth drawing—and a
delicious chocolate note then it lashes the tongue with an intense peppery spice that
made me double-check the ABV so dilute liberally. Savory finish with charred
oak. NTD15000"
5783,4,"The mark of a good distillery is consistently producing 85 points-plus whiskies and with this batch Kavalan's going into double digits. If the distillery has a weakness it's that sometimes it overstates its case and makes even the Aussies look subtle and nuanced. Not here. This is a delicious dessert whisky with vanilla and toffee in abundance and some sugar candy. But having made its case it steps back and is surprisingly gentle. Kavalan with subtlety? Scary!"
5784,4,"If you didn’t know what it was you’d swear this was an old and venerable big sherried whisky and it takes some accepting that it’s still a kitten. The clues are there: hints of immature green fruit and reedy barley and the finish is sweet and soft with none of the astringency of an old wood-influenced malt. But it tastes wonderful: rich sweet and grapey with gooey plums and juicy raisins. A sprinkling of pepper dust reins everything in perfectly. €155 Currently not available in the U.S."
5785,10,"Clove-spiked orange melon pomegranate cherry lozenge and aniseed. Cherry Strawberry Laces growing spiciness ginger pepper almost effervescent fruit jamminess. Later citrus peel vanilla. Finish has vanilla bitterness and fresh green herbal tones. Water keeps the fruit but boosts those spices on the finish. (532 bottles)"
5786,10,"An effusive offering of dark fruits: cranberry blueberry and black currant. This is a beautiful marriage of the spirit and the port cask finishing showing applesauce aged oak macaroons and dry aromatic spices. Black currant holds sway on the tongue yielding to caramel ground ginger a second burst of juicy blueberry with a hot finish evoking strips of dried tropical fruit and flashes of ground pepper. Rewarding and flavorsome."
5787,4,"King Car is the name of the Taiwanese company that owns the Kavalan brand and this lavishly packaged single malt is its standard bearer. It's not hard to see why. More subtle and complex than some earlier bottlings of Kavalan this has an exotic fruit cream toffee and soft banana nose and has bitter orange dark chocolate and pepper on the palate. It's rapier-sharp clean and drying rather than sweet."
5788,10,"Enticing aromas of clove cranberry cooking apple hawthorn allspice tobacco and graphite sticks. It is a spicy mouthful at full strength with clove and pepper dominating the citrus fruit berries and orchard fruit. Dilution is recommended where flavors of baked apple cinnamon and raspberry emerge. NT$8800"
5789,1,"When the news arrived that a distillery was being built in Taiwan the whisky world pretty much dismissed it. When Kavalan appeared at a precocious 42 months it sat up and took notice. Owned by food and beverage conglomerate King Car Kavalan started producing in 2006 with blender Ian Chang at the helm — and a hotline to consultant Dr. Jim Swan. Taiwan’s tropical climate pushes the maturation cycle along at a ferocious rate but the key here is its complexity. Maybe it’s auto-suggestion but I could swear there’s ginseng in here as well as honeycomb and black cherry pie filling. Fresh and clean the spirit is rich and accompanied with great wood.  Mature whisky in three years? It’s an accountant’s dream!"
5790,1,"Here Jim Swan has taken the bold step of double maturing an already quick maturing spirit but it works. Blueberries and rich oak are to the fore while Kavalan’s cherry accents act as the link between spirit and Port. Think rosehips and crème de mures. Thick and liquorous. List price is approximate."
5791,4,"Two out of three ain't bad. While Kavalan doesn't quite pull off the hat trick this is no album filler either (can we still say that?). It is Karaoke Kavalan Taiwanese X Factor whisky: a perfect reproduction of a big plummy pruney tannin-soaked rich fruit compote with late fall damp forest notes. It says a lot about this distillery that five years ago we'd have marveled at this. Today and by its own standards it's Kavalan doing an Aerosmith ballad."
5792,10,"Admirably they go to all the trouble of bottling single casks individually for their Solist range at Kavalan Distillery. This single cask has the most gorgeous deep ruby color and a very fruity nose: pomegranate fresh orange plum walnut jam macadamia and some zestier elements. At full strength it’s mouth drawing; warm fruity with stewed plums young rhubarb pepperpots and fine-quality dark chocolate. A clean finish with the fruit and wood spices remaining fresh to the end. (181 bottles) NT$3500"
5793,10,"With two distilleries now on-site the new Kavalan has a nose of apple and cinnamon pie loaves of bread new hardback books flashes of lemon peel and mild spices that flatter the baked fruits. A lighter structure with pleasant green apple and pear notes a tingle of pepper and allspice becoming creamier with the flavor of sherbet flying-saucer candy. More active spices on the finish amid fading fruits."
5794,10,"Dried banana curry powder chopped cilantro and creamed coconut on the nose but there’s a note of oak astringency and a scent of menthol toothpaste as well. With crème caramel banana dried apricot and candy sweetness the whisky has a good weight in the mouth and builds to flavors of tangerine with perky peppery spices under the tongue. Lengthy finish of banana taffy and a shower of spice."
5795,10,"Whether it’s New York London Paris or Yilan (home of Kavalan) this expression uses the fashionable technique of maturing unpeated spirit in former peaty whisky casks. Sweet seasoned wood smoke chocolate peat dry spices (notably roasted coriander seed) citrus and tropical fruits. A thick warming unctuous mouthfeel perfused with peat smoke tangy grapefruit and baked orange ending on a fruity red licorice and gentle peat finish. Water unlocks moreish honeyed citrus sweetness with a peaty nip in the tail. (Distillery exclusive) NT$1560"
5796,10,"The bottle may project a Tolkienesque image of a craft distillery run by Bilbo Baggins but this is produced at Taiwan’s state-owned Nantou Distillery. This lacks sweetness and structure. The meaty nose has prune juice star anise lamb tagine and predominant sour notes throughout the syrupy-textured palate with flavors of raspberry syrup pomegranate and gummy cherries then tame spices and jumbled savory notes."
5797,9,"Amber gold color. Rich malty aroma with interwoven notes of fruit and oak. Floral note and just the wisp of smoke add complexity. Similar flavors-big and rich-with a long satisfying dryish finish."
5798,9,"Style: Single malt scotch (distillery not identified) Color: Amber mahogany Aroma: Ripe and lush; notes of fallen fruit toffee damp earth and spicy oak with a hint of mint and anise. Palate: Similar to its aroma. Rich full thick and somewhat viscous. A beautiful marriage of lush ripe fruit and spicy resinous oak notes. Evolves on the palate with a very long finish."
5799,9,"Style: Single malt scotch (distillery not identified) Color: Deep gold Aroma: Floral (lavender heather) honey malty delicately fruity (peaches apricots pears citrus) with background spice (especially mint) Palate: Quite similar to its aroma. It starts slightly sweet finishing pleasantly dry and subtly spicy."

5801,9,"Style: single grain Scotch whisky. Price: approx. $120. Available nationwide in limited quantities (imported by International Brands 860/677-0473)."
5802,9,"Very pale gold color. Aggressive notes of tar boat docks seaweed and smoke are tamed by a mouth-coating honeyed vanilla sweetness. Very long smoky salty finish. This is a youthful powerful relentless whisky that you will either like or loathe."
5803,9,"Identified on the label only as a single malt Speyside whisky but does not disclose the distillery. A rounded gently sweet whisky -- nothing too assertive here to offend anyone and unpretentious -- with notes of vanilla toasted coconut caramel apple honeydew melon and ripe berries. Creamy finish."
5804,12,"Enchanting and bursting with character: On the nose vanilla cupcakes zested with lemon sweet strawberries on angel food cake blueberry-cinnamon syrup toasted oats and woodsy spices of cedar sandalwood and nutmeg. The full-bodied palate is alive with tropical and citrus fruits—kiwi papaya mango pomelo grapefruit satsuma—but braced by a malty backbone nutty and spiced. After all that excitement the finish is practically sedate calmly wrapping up with clean malt and a whiff of fruit. Water is a must to fully unlock the flavors. (114 bottles)"
5821,4,"At present this is a distillery-only bottling but we need to start a campaign to get it on general release because it is a modestly-priced gem of a malt whisky. This is fruit compote in a glass with blueberry blackberry rose petal talcum powder and redcurrant on the nose and strawberry jam and summer fruit cordial on the palate. It's a palate cleanser all soft fresh and fruity. Summer's arrived early. £30"
5805,12,"When you feel you’ve earned a treat pour a dram of this bottled candy. The nose is a tropical fruit basket with papaya guava mango jackfruit and dried kiwi; extra goodies come in the form of Jordan almonds and vanilla sandwich cookies. Consistent tropical flavors on the silky palate. Nuttiness gentle spice milk chocolate and coffee bean emerge with water. Intensely satisfying on the finish with persistent fruit integrated oak almonds and grapefruit peel. (243 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
5806,10,"Deep polished chestnut color with a nutty nose of dried apple blueberry syrup clove and cinnamon; the high alcohol mingles with scents of walnut hazelnut and soy sauce. The deep berry flavors burst with black cherry crème de cassis chocolate peppercorn and an exceptional mint leaf note. Despite the strength it’s seductively irresistible and a whisky you’ll return to time after time. (232 bottles)"
5807,10,"Rosy red apples damson jam quince jelly piquant spices pomegranate juice and cracked black pepper on the nose. The palate dutifully follows suit with cherry red apple cranberry blackberry and raspberry until overwhelmed by high-strength alcohol bristling with clove pepper and ginger spices. Lastly a vanilla-cupcake sweetness is enhanced by cooked apple while water conjures up a delicious watermelon note with a finish of overbaked deep-dish apple pie. (251 bottles)"
5808,10,"An implacable tide of sherry aromas succulent sultana and currant fruit dried apple bara brith tea cake treacle black tea and fabulous baking spices: cinnamon nutmeg and clove. A thick chewy malty mouthful with chocolate Horlicks coffee notes and that well-honed Penderyn spice character woven in among the dark fruit. A sweet swan song of clove and peppercorn meets espresso molasses dark toffee and burnt staves. Quite a gem this one. (600 bottles for U.S.)"
5809,10,"Subtle well-judged port cask influence integrates well with the Penderyn spirit to produce an entrancing whisky. Substantial aromas of chocolate dried fruits dates cocoa snuff and a prickle of spices rise from the glass. There’s good weight in the mouth with flavors of chocolate gingersnap dates dried cranberry forest honey a supportive chorus of spices and a heavenly finish of dark sweet fruits. (792 bottles for U.S.)"
5810,10,"Blender Aista Jukneviciute finishes Celt in peated Islay quarter casks that enable the sooty charcoal smoke and maritime notes to sink their claws into the fresh lemon mandarin and buttery toasty aromas. Penderyn the best known of the small but growing number of Welsh distilleries is in the process of constructing a second distillery with a visitor center in Swansea anticipated to open in 2021 and has proposed a third facility for Llandudno. Sweet citrus dark fruits chocolate and spicy smoke linger on the finish. Forget Daenerys this is the whisky of dragons. Number 17 in the 2018 Top 20"
5811,10,"A good single cask pick should stand up proudly at cask strength yet still show plenty of character after dilution: This aged Welsh whisky does both superbly. Aromas of stewed rhubarb cherry syrup five spice fresh oak ripening black currants and ground ginger. It opens with sweet flavors of lemon shortbread vanilla cherry gummy bears and raspberry building to a climax of clove cinnamon bark and tannic fruit skins. Don’t miss!"
5812,10,"No prizes for guessing where the peated Islay quarter casks used for finishing came from but this beautiful whisky has firm sooty charcoal smoke impressive maritime characteristics and aromas of fresh lemon mandarin and buttered toast. Sweet citrus with a buttery mouthfeel and generous smoke and spice. Beautifully weighted it ends with darker fruits chocolate and spicy smoke on the finish. Love it!"
5813,4,"The unusual distilling process and some maturation in Madeira casks has given standard Penderyn a liqueur-like perfumey quality many whisky fans don’t care for. This is a single bourbon cask bottling of the 11th cask the distillery ever filled to mark its 10th anniversary and is less cloying less feminine and more gutsy than the standard version. It’s also very palatable and of excellent quality. Some will make it to America but the price tag will deter all but the most passionate."
5814,10,"This rather good after-dinner dram is finished in peated Islay whisky casks. It is not a peated Welsh whisky but don’t let that stop you. With its refreshing aromas of lemon floor polish pine needles gentle antiseptic smoked fish and breezy beach bonfires we can cheerfully drop the pedantic objections to its name. This successfully delivers a wallop of spicy smoke lemon and vanilla biscuits a bit like consuming creamy rice pudding beside a smoking peat kiln.(396 bottles for U.S.)"
5815,4,"Penderyn quotes a respected writer on its website saying that no one does port-influenced whisky better. This bottling certainly makes the claim. It was a single cask but there have been others equally as impressive and there will be more. This is brash colorful unsubtle and a bit daft — so was comedian Tommy Cooper — but still unforgettable and easy to fall in love with.  256 bottles.  £146"
5816,4,"Penderyn will miss distiller Gillian MacDonald who has gone to work at Glenmorangie because it has been moving up the gears of late. This is a traveling circus of a whisky with all sorts of oral treats to keep you entertained. It's not for the faint-hearted. There are rich stewed fruits baked apple blueberries and spirit-soaked black and red berries all delivered with a power punch. Great. £30"
5817,10,"Chocolate rich berry fruit honeydew green grape oat cookies dark toffee and oak spices on the nose. Flavors of chocolate flakes Oreo cinnamon malt and hazelnut with a concentration of spices on the tip of the tongue before a flavorsome finish of Hershey bars. It’s delicious and well-made but occupies a very specific place on the flavor spectrum so one to try before you buy.(792 bottles for U.S.)"
5818,10,"This nugget of Welsh gold has a nose of candied orange and lemon slices toasted spices herb garden light vanilla and the oils of finely shredded peel. On the palate there’s toffee and orange cake an array of tropical fruits with papaya and passion fruit sweetness and a good thrust of pepper and clove leaving just a hint of grated chocolate and cask char in a dry finish."
5819,10,"Fresh fruits satsuma peel lime zest pear lemon meringue pie and a cheeky burst of spices in this red wine and American oak bourbon barrel-finished whisky. Marshmallow softness with apple cooked Jell-O and cherry slam into fruit-skin bitterness chicory root and aniseed descending into spicy bitter fruit flavors. This perks the palate up no end. Oak seems to hold stronger cards than the wine soaked into the staves."
5820,10,"This madeira-finished whisky delivers a beautiful combination of crunchy red apple dried apple rings toasted oak cubes of vanilla fudge honey and dabs of orange. It’s a friendly dram and it draws you in; attractive but not flashy or abundantly fragrant. Soft fruits though not instantly sweet accompanied by vegetal notes almonds and some spicy bitterness with ginger pepper and clove encircling the tongue."
5822,4,"A distillery-only bottling last year and I'm delighted it's now more widely available. Penderyn is as brash about portwood as the Aussies and this has a rich creamy and sweet liqueur-like taste with blackcurrant to the fore. It's a delight. Penderyn is bottled in batches so this is a different version from last year’s but it's close. I called it fruit compote in a glass. £36"
5823,9,"This whisky has no age statement but it is only several years old. It’s also finished off in a Madeira cask. Nicely matured for its age; perhaps in part due to its unique copper distillation system. It’s a soft whisky with layers of creamy sweetness (vanilla toffee) delicate fruit (coconut blueberry black raspberry) and almond with a little youthful heat on the finish. Already pleasant this whisky should only need a few more years to reach full maturity."
5824,9,"The original Penderyn is finished in Madeira casks. I like the original better (which I rated an 84) as it tastes more mature and the Madeira seems to dovetail better with the other flavors. Fruity (red raspberry strawberry banana) with underlying sweet notes (honeyed vanilla caramel a hint of butterscotch). Quick clean finish. Maybe this whisky just needed a little more aging for everything to come together?"
5825,10,"This edition was matured in bourbon but finished in Madeira casks which lends it a honeyed sweet nose of cream soda lychee whole almond and dried tropical fruit. Smartly the finishing cask gives a lift but never dominates. A fresh clean taste but the mouthfeel has a frailty so although you will find lemon icing sugar candy bananas and molten honey this doesn’t quite live up to its rousing name. £31"
5826,9,"My feelings here are the same as for the Sherrywood: it comes across as younger and less mature than the original Madeira wood finish version. This one has some peat smoke in the mix. Malty sweet (with some graham cracker nougat and hints of butterscotch) peppered with light smoke. Quick lightly smoky finish."
5827,7,"This select bottling of Bernheim Original comes from Warehouse Y on the 4th floor and is non-chill filtered. Without the filtering the nose is notably more expressive and becomes a real showcase for wheat grain oak spice caramel and citrus. On the palate this whiskey maintains a firm balance between soft and strong with supple wheat grain entwined with caramel oak and cinnamon spice. A long flavorful finish caps off a well-curated selection of an excellent whiskey. (Julio’s Liquors only)"
5828,8,"Wheated bourbon fans will enjoy this wheat whiskey with its distinctly bourbon nose of sweet cornbread and new oak topped off with mint and pine aromas. It starts soft on the palate but flavors build nicely as it rolls along delivering graham cracker citrus fruit pecans and cake batter. It remains really fresh and lovely as caramel corn and drying cocoa powder emerge on the finish. A well-crafted and easy-drinking alternative to bourbon."
5829,12,"It opens with floral and fruit aromas: strawberries peach blossoms dried apple rings mulberries plums. There’s also amaretto dried ginger licorice and cacao nibs. Rich and a little hot on the palate it’s chewy with dry-roasted almonds cracked walnuts coffee bean chai spice and grilled plums. Mouthwatering on the finish drawing out chile heat black pepper spice chocolate-covered coffee bean and dry oak. (450 bottles)"
5830,9,"Heaven Hill’s straight wheat whiskey Bernheim Original is a pleasant drink but I always felt that some extra aging and a higher proof would give it additional richness and complexity to propel it to a higher level. That’s what this new expression accomplishes. Soothing gentle layers of caramel-coated nuts vanilla fudge coconut cream maple syrup and marzipan with a sprinkle of cinnamon and cocoa. So easy to embrace. Nicely done."
5831,12,"The loveliest qualities of wheat grain are present in this delicate whiskey. It starts off with banana-nut muffin orange Creamsicle toasted wood lemongrass and bubble gum on the nose. The palate has a simplicity that’s well-executed: orange oil toasted Popsicle stick roasted nuts and a full complement of oak spices. It finishes clean and satisfying with chocolate cinnamon white pepper and pecans. The definition of easy-drinking. Best Values"
5832,12,"A mashbill of 100% soft white wheat imparts sweet pastry notes throughout which dominate despite the mizunara-cask finish. Almond danish with drizzled icing lemon curd coconut flakes vanilla and baby powder on the light sweet nose. The palate has more of the same: white frosting on pound cake lemon-lime soda vanilla ice cream and honeyed almonds. It finishes sweet and simple but satisfying. Not a whiskey you need to think about—just enjoy it."
5833,2,"Billed as one of the first bottled in bond wheat whiskeys its nose starts pleasantly oily and tart leading to notes of green tea sassafras licorice and leather. The palate is grain-forward offering spice raspberry jam sweet orange and black pepper. A finish of chocolate baking spice and honey is balanced by light bitterness. A restrained but expressive wheater with lots of character and flavors that linger. Opens up beautifully with water. (600 bottles)"
5834,9,"This is a rare single barrel non-chill filtered release. Straight wheat whiskeys can be almost too easy-going. Not chill-filtering adds teasing subtle complexity. Gently sweet with maple syrup caramel marzipan and coconut cream along with a dusting of vanilla cinnamon and green tea. A whiskey for a lazy Saturday afternoon...or perhaps with pancakes at brunch? (Julio’s Liquors exclusive)"
5835,7,"In a market myopically focused on big old and oaky this Bernheim Original single barrel is an uncommon subtle whiskey that invites you to lean in and listen closer. If you do you’ll be treated to soft wheat intertwined with caramel cinnamon and subtle cherry. Oak gets added to the mix in the mid-palate without dropping any of the other flavors established. The real star of this whiskey is the finish: long dry ice-cube cool and extremely impressive. (Drink Up New York only)"
5836,12,"Made with 95% soft red winter wheat this whiskey is reticent at first giving up little of its personality though there are glimpses of violet dried rose petals berries and oranges on the nose. The palate has more dried flowers and a bit of fruit along with oak nuts and dark chocolate but a peculiar herbal piney top note elbows its way to the front. Everything resolves on the finish with semi-dark chocolate pepper dark fruit and oak."
5837,2,"A fragrant nose offers scents of orange blossom cinnamon lemon peel vanilla and balanced oak. The palate has a drier orange peel note as well as peanut shells cinnamon ginger and bitter chocolate. Quite dry on the back palate where the wood influence becomes much more prominent. The finish is light with bitter chocolate some nuttiness tobacco dried herbs and drying oak. Pleasant spiciness cinnamon and citrus overall."
5838,11,"Distilled from 100% white winter wheat; pale straw. Salty dough and sweet light canned fruit. Like grain whisky on the tongue: light sweet delicate more fruit cocktail and a hint of milk chocolate. A smooth and pleasant finish. Simple but delightful."
5839,11,"Sweet crisp nose: apple mint wintergreen. Grainy in the mouth; sweet bready flavors. The whiskey coats the mouth but more in an obscuring way; it seems to get between you and the flavors. It is quite smooth compared to young bourbons but it leaves me looking for more. Overall impression is of a sweeter younger whiskey that needs to mature and the clean character makes me think maturity would look good on it."
5840,11,"A small-barrel aged whiskey. The nose is sweet and fairly simple: cotton candy wintergreen faint menthol and some heat. It’s hot in the mouth too. The mint/wintergreen gives way to light caramel and sweet fudge; it’s even a bit sticky. There’s a need for more depth to balance the sweetness and some more age to mellow the heat. More rough-edged than ‘big distiller’ whiskey at this point."
5841,11,"This was barrel-aged for a year then “brightened” to white clarity; just the slightest hint of amber remains. But the aging has taken away the shouty greenness of new make; the nose is clean a light blend of corn and woodsy vanilla. Sweet flavors bubble on the tongue: coconut circus peanuts peanut butter fudge vanilla jellybeans. The finish lingers in corn and rye. There’s more than meets the eye here and it’s priced for impulsive experimentation."
5842,11,"“Mellow as moonlight” on the label; the old Cascade slogan from the pre-Dickel branding days at Dickel. This is a throwback too; from before the barrel. The nose is full of sweet and fresh corn “cream” and cornbread a nod to Dickel’s 84% corn mashbill. Some peppery notes join it on the palate but that corn sweetness follows all the way to the end. One of the best white whiskeys I’ve tasted and not overpriced."
5843,11,"Distilled from “malted Bavarian hard wheat” on the still formerly used at Germain-Robin. Good pedigree; does it deliver? Bread/flour in the aroma like a fresh bag of flour with a fruity alcohol edge to it the wheat tang I know from beer. In the mouth it comes through as bread and crackers. It’s somewhat hot but it’s a brandy/aromatic heat: vapor-producing. The finish pulls more grain in finally. They’re aging some of this; should be a great whiskey."
5844,11,"Distilled from “bottle-ready IPA.” Sure is; the hops leap out of the glass piney and pithy a real west coast beer and whiskey experience in a glass. Quite a fat mouthfeel for 99 proof a big oily thing that rolls around the tongue making itself at home with flaring hop flavor — not really bitter — and an underlying sweetness. Bittering kicks in on the finish. An astonishing experience that really grows on you…but ultimately there’s a lack of depth. Price is per 1 liter."
5845,11,"White whiskey amazing legs on the glass. Classic white dog nose: green corn estery fruits a bit sharp but not burny hot. Clean taste of corn spirit no off flavors and very well-mannered for 50% unaged whiskey; I can hold this on my tongue easily and there are some good bits of sweet candy as it rolls off. Nicely done."
5846,11,"New make from the same mashbill as Evan Williams bottled “straight from the still.” Much higher proof than the others but not noticeably hotter in the nose; that’s light corn and grass with a bit of minty spice. Hotter in the mouth but quite pleasant and evolving: fresh mint gives way to light corn then a slightly oily slip to brisk sweetness…and you realize you didn’t notice the serious overproof. A well-behaved white dog."
5847,11,"Crisps the nose hairs a bit but it’s pure corn even a bit of cornbread. Tip a sip in and it’s nothing but more green corn sweet fresh — hot for sure but not overwhelming — and pretty tasty for what it is. With white whiskey we’re walking the fine line between flavor and raw wound at all times and this one finds the line."
5848,11,"Smelling the rye from a foot away after pouring. Exceptionally clean aroma of grain; the oily/spicy rye notes come through clearly. Quite smooth. Not a lot of flavors: very focused on the rye itself with grain and just a touch of mint. A long finish with sweet grain that slowly turns to mint in the end."
5849,11,"Barely-aged white whiskey. Light sharp fruit (brighter than the High West Single Malt) a brittle sweetness new-make greenness. Quite smooth even a bit creamy with a light float of vanilla and a hit of grain in the middle. It all wafts away on a razor-edged cloud of a finish. Smooth for a white but I'd like more substance."
5850,11,"This is new make from the Rittenhouse Rye mashbill unaged right off the still. Yeasty mash notes come through strongly with a big nose of rye and corn underneath. It smells fresh and alive. Wow that’s powerful stuff. Much hotter than the Trybox Corn this one is on fire with rye spice; it’s got me breaking a sweat! A bit of water brings out more grain notes and some tempering sweetness but it’s still no pussycat. Cleanly powerful."
5851,11,"Provocative: spelt’s an interesting aroma. Grainy and a bit earthy with hints of golden delicious apple all combining in the nose. There’s a fast high flow of creaminess that spreads quickly and disappears leaving a slightly fruity grainy aftertaste. Interesting sensations and again quite clean."
5852,11,"Aromas are soft and creamy with a waft of sweet corn — underlain with a fairly blunt alcohol burn that comes through more as you smell it. Quite sweet on the palate a wash of green corn but the flavor isn’t enough to tangle successfully with the fuel which leads to a tongue-curlingly hot finish. Some definite potential but it really needs time in a big oak barrel (or some ice and a bottle of Dr. Pepper)."
5853,11,"Nose is sweet corn with some mintiness to it and some herbal notes; hot but not off-putting. Tastes are not as sweet as expected. A bit flat though the sweet corn does come through toward the end. Again though this one is quite hot which is not surprising; the Hudson Baby Bourbons — which this is the foundation for — have struck me as hot also. Price is per 375 ml."
5854,11,"A lively light fruitiness (white grapes green plum) in the nose. Quite grainy but with an interesting hint of vanilla and a slight saltiness. Finish is a bit astringent unlike the other Koval spirits. I’m finding these an interesting exercise in distillation and educational."
5855,11,"So that’s what wheat smells like: not much. The aromas here seem to be mostly yeast-derived with a faint ripe fruitiness (undefined: peach apple?) and alcohol heat and a touch of wheat-origin sweet grass. Wheat’s in the mouth like chewing fresh grain with some water and alcohol. It’s all there and the finish is sweet and it’s clean but…that’s about all. White bread whiskey."
5856,11,"Made from 100% rye and USDA certified organic. Very hot for 40%; herbal nose very green with rye. Much smoother on the palate and very quick. There’s a fast shot of rye mint up front some grassiness and a sharp flick of heat…and then it vanishes leaving only a fading flinty-sweet afternote. Clean but not a lot of substance."
5857,11,"Very similar to the Midwest Wheat in aroma with a slight additional tanginess…but that could be from sensory deprivation. Drier in the mouth with a slight medicinal character to it that increases as the finish goes on; like a high school chemistry lab storeroom or a bottle of fresh aspirin."
5858,10,"I’m calling this the pitmaster’s dram: the nose has muscular peat smoke prune juice savory notes of barbecued brisket bark venison charcuterie and a hint of peppermint cream. The palate is a gluttonous feast of sweet dark fruits milk chocolate dried fig plum sultanas and ginger sliding into baked orange and spicy gingerbread and wallowing luxuriously in chocolate and rich fruit. A welcome addition to Eifel’s already impressive range. (1200 bottles for the U.S.)"
5859,10,"A whisky with amazing natural colors and the aromas turned up to 11; polished red apples mixed peels currant clove peppercorn and crinkly dried red chiles. Sweet raspberry fudge initially then the mouth-drawing high alcohol bites sending it spiraling through clove plum skins baked fruit crumble cookies charred oak nutty toffee black cherry and coffee grounds. Some single cask whisky can be a rollercoaster: this is the whole theme park! (282 bottles)—"
5860,10,"This latest unpeated vintage has aromas of maple syrup peanut brittle sesame snaps aged balsamic stretchy cherry taffy toasted coconut and snuff tobacco. It’s 6 years old comprising a primary maturation in refill red wine barrels and a 2-year finish in cream sherry casks producing a syrupy-textured dram with baked desserts of plum and orange brown sugar ginger pudding vanilla chocolate-covered nuts and a burnt sugar finish. (2400 bottles)"
5861,12,"Orange peel dried ginger pineapple baking spices vanilla and cherry syrup on the nose. With water the grain and sweetness develop into a layered confection of honey saffron and sweet nuts: a bite of baklava. The palate is spiced and full a touch fruity with dried orange peel and figs spiced with dried ginger and black pepper and richly nutty with toasted oak. There’s a visceral character of chewiness in the mouth and warmth sliding through the chest a sensation that commands you to spend time enjoying the dram. (282 bottles)"
5862,10,"The longer you leave this the smokier it gets; earthy peat heavy smoke hints of bacon fat and steaming asphalt with blossom honey vanilla fudge and lemonade. Dense flavors of honey vanilla caramel sweet satsuma Jelly Tots and lime Fruit Pastilles with mild ginger pepper and clove as smoke builds in the throat. Molten caramel and lemon peel finish scorched by peat smoke. A magnificent use of Islay casks."
5863,10,"This is a colossal rye the result of 2 years in first-fill and refill red wine barrels and 2 years in malaga casks. The nose suggests a thick velvety dram of dark rye bread cinnamon nutmeg rosemary prune juice sultana and pecan pie with herbal undertones. On the palate there is dark smooth toffee stewed plum bramble and spun sugar stalked by ginger pepper and cinnamon. Oh the Manhattans you will make. (2400 bottles)"
5864,10,"Imagine stepping inside a tropical palm house: herbs florals and waxy foliage. Fresh zingy hops lemongrass stalks caramel and strawberry bubble gum. Palate is soft with lychee melon and white grape supported by spices before it melts into creamy panna cotta and ends with citrus burnt sugar and herbal stems. Finish is spicy saturating with dark-sugar sweetness. Try this Bavarian whisky from vintage chestnut grappa casks; it’s really interesting."
5865,12,"The malt shows well on the nose with toasted almonds cooked cereal and rolled oats; there’s also coriander seed dill dewy grass peaches and nectarines. It’s intensely spiced and herbaceous on the palate: clove-studded orange chai sandalwood pouch tobacco and more coriander and aniseed. With water milk chocolate almonds and hazelnuts emerge. The finish is oaky with hints of tobacco and persistent spice especially coriander. Compelling. (300 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
5866,10,"Like licking caramel-drizzled mint chocolate chip ice cream; master distiller Henric Molin’s high-rye mashbill delivers a great balance between rye spices and creamy sweetness. Quite soft with mint and caramel at first; layers of toffee and cinnamon follow then becoming mouth-drawing as the pepper and clove spices crest a peak of intensity tapering to toffee and cinnamon and a dry finish."
5867,12,"Floral resinous almost hoppy on the nose with dusty cedar chest old leather chair white pepper licorice and an intriguing tangy note like pickles. The palate’s intense oakiness is tempered by an herbaceous sweetness and integrated spice—cinnamon cubeb and allspice with chalky minerality. There’s a savory and saline quality that lingers into the finish which is spicy and dry with oak tannins. Distilled in 1989 in what was then Czechoslovakia using Czech peat and matured in Czech oak casks. (300 bottles; U.S. only)"
5868,10,"This kosher whisky has abundant flavors from both the bourbon and shaved toasted and re-charred (STR) casks. Golden syrup caramel pastry vanilla and marshmallow on the nose with floral top notes hints of dried apple and bold nutmeg cinnamon and pepper. A firm juicy-sweet palate with caramel vanilla shortbread honey orange nectarine pepper nougat and almond. The finish is short sweet and lightly spiced. Editors' Choice"
5869,10,"Using 88% Swedish corn and air-seasoned virgin American oak casks this has a well-integrated profile with abundant aromas of salted caramel banana peel wafers black tea and light spices. It’s scrumptious and moreish with a smooth and silky mouthfeel bringing flavors of golden syrup orange peel and candied lemon leaning toward deeper caramel and vanilla toffee notes later with unobtrusive spices carrying into the mouth-coating finish."
5870,10,"Norway’s first arctic whisky is triple distilled from Nordic barley and glacial melt-water. A nose of raisin-packed fruit scones pan-tossed whole spices warm banana bread lemon tart bramble jelly maraschino cherries and spiced apple. The palate is honeyed and buttery with biscuit-like cereal notes pepper pronounced clove vanilla hints of citrus peel some late stewed fruits and a finish of chewy fruit bars. Kr 700"
5871,2,"M&H (Milk & Honey) founded in 2013 is Israel’s first whisky distillery. This expression and its sibling bottling Double Cask are M&H’s first to hit the U.S. Aged 2 years in bourbon STR (shaved toasted and re-charred) and Islay casks its nose offers candied lemon lime leaf tea and licorice. The palate is soft fruity and spiced with chocolate and light peat. The finish is spiced and lightly peated with tropical fruit accents. Brilliant texture and an unusual spice profile."
5872,10,"A creamy and spicy nose slightly nutty with hints of mixed peel and malt biscuits. As it warms in the glass a lovely bouquet of toffee hazelnut cinnamon and nutmeg emerges. A thick malty mouthfeel of toffee and cinnamon finds harmony between the sweetness crisp rye and fresh green edge of the spices. The finish has citrus and herbal notes and a long spiciness with a touch of mint. (Individual reviewer rating: 92)"
5873,10,"Made from a mash of malted wheat malted barley and malted oats this evokes chocolate orange with hints of lemon and grapefruit toasted coconut ground ginger clove peppercorn and cantaloupe. Toffee sweet and tangy satsuma a dash of clove chocolate-dipped lemon biscuits and a hint of oak astringency usher in a finish of bitter peel oils and ground pepper. Try a splash of water to accentuate the bitter orange notes. £37"
5874,10,"Master mezcalero Douglas French captures the flavor of native Oaxacan heirloom corn in this unique and singular spirit—the first single-barrel Mexican whisky available in the U.S. Distilled in San Agustín de las Juntas each of French’s trio of whiskies uses a single variety of ancestral corn that requires hand-harvesting promoting jobs in traditional farming. Aged for a mere 10 months in French oak Yellow has swirling notes of blue iris dried chilies and fresh linen around a core of plump corn with tangy marmalade maple syrup pepper and a spiced-honey finish. Number 20 in the 2018 Top 20"
5875,10,"This impressive whisky lets the port lead the dance but never treads on the toes of its partner. The nose reveals prominent cask influences of pomegranate inky plum flesh blackberry and gummy cherries with a supporting cast of honeycomb dried herbs and bay leaf. It jinks and dodges between dried peel fudge baked orange vanilla and fine spice notes before developing into a sweet ripe cherry and red apple finale."
5876,10,"Cherry cranberry strawberry raspberry sorbet plum skin juicy sultana sweet barley notes and a smudge of fine spices indicate the influence of the Israeli red wine casks. The palate is fruity but not sweet with red grape pepper malt vinous notes and ascendant peppery oak spices then a dry finish of vanilla cream raspberry cordial and spices. Delicious but after the first sip further flavor shifts are subtle."
5877,0,"A heavily peated whisky finished in a single rum cask. Very smoky with a lot of heat but a balanced depth. Quite meaty on the palate. Heather honey supple leather English peppercorn sauce and salted vanilla wafers with incense hanging in the air. Charred apple skins and red berry fruit keep this from being out of balance. Boysenberry lavender and smoke on the finish. Very forceful but complex and intriguing. If beefeaters didn’t already have a drink they’d probably drink this. (360 bottles; U.S. only)"
5878,12,"Toasted malt fresh grapefruit and lemon coconut vanilla honeysuckle poached pears saline candle wax and campfire smoke on the nose. Despite the high proof the mouthfeel is silky fizzing with lemon and dry with chalky minerality though savory malt and a smoky backbone make up the meat of the flavors. The finish is ashy with oak char coffee bean and the slight tang of lemon peel. (229 bottles)"
5879,10,"This is one of those delightful whiskies where the aromas leap from the glass; a battle of citrus between lime pineapple and clementine obvious rum notes and a strong hit of pepper. A fast-paced turnover of brown sugar candied lemon and lime slices vanilla fudge pepper and ground ginger flavors while the latter stages race through nectarine pear banana-flavored candy tropical fruits and notes of cookie dough. Utterly electrifying! €100"
5880,10,"Tomer Goren head distiller at Milk & Honey Distillery in Tel Aviv excels at warm climate single malt production under the intensity of the Mediterranean sun. His ethos is beautifully captured within this kosher-certified flagship bottling matured in bourbon and shaved toasted and re-charred casks. It exudes a nose of golden syrup vanilla marshmallow jasmine dried apple nutmeg cinnamon and pepper. Flavorful and juicy the palate has satisfying depth with caramel vanilla shortbread honey and orange daubed with vivaciously spicy black pepper. Number 20 in the 2020 Top 20"
5881,10,"Using kosher-certified oloroso and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks this Tel Avivian whisky evokes dried strawberry plum pudding and black cherry aromas with strong peppercorn notes and a dusting of cocoa powder. With early red fruits and black cherry this glides through milky coffee and chocolate pudding buffeted by growing spices and a rasp of oak char before a pleasant finish of baking chocolate and bourbon biscuits."
5882,10,"A dark amber dram made from 90% rye yields a nose of chestnuts mushroom consommé earthiness nutmeg and clove. Dark berries dominate with bramble crème de cassis black cherry plum and mixed peel then chocolate cinnamon and nutmeg—a great autumnal dram after an invigorating walk in the countryside. Unique and confident whisky with an inky blue-fruit finish matched with dry and gentle spiciness. (3000 bottles)"
5883,10,"Blue iris dried chilies and fresh linen; the corn is sweet and fat and the aromas integrate more harmoniously than the White and Black expressions. Fresh and fruity orange marmalade honey oozing into maple syrup developing more complexity as the smooth layers shift to accommodate the growing pepper and chili heat ahead of a spicy honey finish. For a 10 month old single cask whiskey this is remarkably impressive."
5884,10,"Matured in Pedro Ximénez and red wine casks blender Dhavall Gandhi’s first main release has a nose of pomegranate cranberry and fine spices. The red fruits come through slowly on a wave of alcohol developing a tasty flavor of chewy toffee with fruitcake cinnamon and vanilla. Water exposes a spicier character but it’s worth experiencing this at full strength for that exceptional fruit-edged toffee flavor. (5922 bottles) £65"
5885,10,"Head distiller Tomer Goren took parcels of bourbon and shaved toasted and re-charred (STR) cask whisky and finished them in French Limousin oak cognac casks delivering a nose of chocolate brownie mixed baking fruit and pepper. The palate delivers vanilla essence malty sweetness and butterscotch with young green fruits toffee and honeycomb then concludes with notes of nutmeg and clove just as the mouthfeel develops a luxurious velvety and slightly oily texture."
5886,10,"A decade ago Eifel began to distill in the German grain-distilling tradition using a column still with a second pot still distillation. Named after a low mountain range in western Germany this has a punchy nose of stewed apple and rhubarb pepper clove ground ginger and dried citrus peel with hints of chocolate. Quite distinctive: stewed fruit plum peppermint candied orange and a finish of chocolate-covered mint candy. (3000 bottles)"
5887,12,"Clean fresh malt character manifests as a whole host of banana products: chips bread and pudding with Nilla wafers; there are also coconut shavings sliced almonds confectioners’ sugar and lemon and lime peels. Though youth peeks through with heat on the palate the bright flavors of lemon banana coconut and a whole bouquet of violets and roses provide balance and lead into a clean short finish. A little more time and this whisky won’t just bloom—it’ll flourish. (1560 bottles)"
5888,10,"A floral fruity nose with apricot mango sour lemon and snuff tobacco on this chardonnay cask-finished whisky. Tangerine flesh honey sweet confectioner’s sugar vanilla fudge and a dusting of earthy spices it’s best to imbibe at full strength as this is smooth and easy to drink. Tel Aviv’s climate exacts an appreciable angels’ share but it would be fascinating to revisit this style once the whisky has mellowed further."
5889,10,"A deeper corn note than White the Oaxacan black corn retains a firm nugget of sweetness aromas of banana skins and dusty earth. To sip it’s creamy cool and refreshing with light mandarin flavors gingerbread corn fritters vanilla and peppery heat from the French oak cask. The finish has gentle warmth with root ginger and kernels of roasted corn. Distinctive and highly promising."
5890,10,"Spirit of Yorkshire Distillery has two Forsyths pot stills and a four-plate copper
column giving them plenty of options. An encouraging step toward their flagship
single malt this lemon-pale dram evokes aromas of lemon herb gardens clotted
cream marshmallow and a little vanilla. It’s sweet as candy with flavors of sugared
almonds Sweethearts butter icing candied lemon peel pancakes and a finish of
peppery arugula leaves. (6000 bottles) £55"
5891,10,"Finished in French oak Islay casks originally filled with New Zealand pinot noir (think Ardbeg Blaaack) the nose has honey lemon zest Golden Delicious apple pear salty peat smoke crumbly compost aromatic spices and hints of gooseberry and grapefruit. Light-bodied and toothsomely sweet it skims the tongue with flavors of nougat lemon melted vanilla ice cream clove and sherbet with a brief reappearance of peat smoke late into the finish. Kr 700"
5892,2,"Hye-Land’s inaugural U.S. release made from 100% malted wheat at Eraskh Winery in Armenia (which also has a distillery) aged in Caucasus Mountain oak barrels and then finished in Armenian brandy barrels. The nose offers seasoned oak citrus ginger and allspice. The palate brings sweet notes of melon coconut shavings tobacco Christmas cake ginger and clove all lightly accented by black pepper. The finish is viscous and has balanced sweetness."
5893,10,"Turbocharged sour cherry aromas are propelled from the glass by high-strength alcohol leaving a backwash of toffee coffee grounds dunnage and pepper. After its 6-month finish in a kosher Rimon Winery barrel it’s become a skittish prospect of fiery pomegranate and rose-hip jelly its mighty strength runs amok with the spices among the sourness of dark fruits. Use water to emphasize the pleasurable maraschino cherry notes."
5894,12,"Grain takes center stage showing itself in a restrained sweet manner: aromas of marzipan oatmeal cookies Jordan almonds crushed peanuts on an ice cream sundae and caramel. The palate is consistent offering almond croissant sugar cookie vanilla pudding light caramel and a creamy mouthfeel finished off with supple oak caramel and almonds. Made in Patagonia Argentina. 2500 Argentine pesos; Argentina only"
5895,12,"The first Chinese single malt to be exported to the U.S. Toffee apples butterscotch haystacks peonies and orange wedges on the light and sweet nose. More sweetness on the palate flowers and fruit undergirded by grain: candied rose petals citrus peel vanilla Pudding Pop green banana and pencil shavings. The texture is velvety but the flavors don’t leave much of an impression with a finish of vanilla and sweet oak that’s barely there. (2884 bottles)"
5896,10,"White has the most familiar corn whiskey character of this Mexican trio. Sweet buttered cobs of corn faint toasted spices green corn husks and peanuts on the nose. The palate is sweet gentle and refreshing bathed in honey with dried peel sweet corn toasted oak spices and a late sensation of charred oak burnt toast and peppercorn. That slight burnt note just creeps into the finish."
5897,10,"Pepper and allspice light up with savory brisket notes star anise a dry nuttiness and a pile of peanut shells. The flavor slowly comes into focus with stewed apple red currant pomegranate and cranberry background spices and late caramel sweetness. The finish has throbbing gum-tingling heavy clove notes with toffee penny chews and red licorice."
5898,10,"White pepper-dappled summer fruits on the nose with squishy overripe melon banana peel zesty lime dried grasses and clove with a slightly rubberized note like BMX handlebar grips. This young Bavarian single malt has a rich syrupy texture and tastes of sour fruits bitter orange peel and barley shifting to creamy caramel and peppery spices. Finish of caramel peppercorn and peach pit. Not bad at all. (691 bottles)"
5899,12,"Made from nixtamalized corn (a process that increases the grain’s nutritional value; it’s used when making masa for tortillas) double-distilled and aged in new toasted and used oak casks. It’s unconventional as most Mexican corn whiskeys are; the nose has caramel stewed apples and pears orange peel candied almond and pencil eraser. A bit papery and green on the palate with Popsicle stick dried apple rings and toasted grain finishing hot and short."
